      This looks like an incredible position. Too bad you don't need a data scientist! :)
                      
                  
      May I ask if which time zones you prefer? I was going to ping you via e-mail but this could help other potential applicants too.
                      
                  
      Some hours of overlap with GMT/London would be nice, but not necessary... we're fine with any location.
                      
                  
      Is it a new cryptocurrency, or a new project based on an existing cryptocurrency?
                      
                  
      Good question. We'll build on top of the king (BTC) or queen (ETH). We could start with plain BTC or ETH to speed things ups, and issue an ERC20 (ETH) or RSK-based token (BTC) down the road.But we're not into the pump and dump thing and we want to be 200% compliant. So we'll have to analyse this move carefully. We're also very open to new ideas and input from the new members.
                      
                  
      Have you considered using Tendermint? We just published the results of a few months of Jepsen testing: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15175984
                      
                  
      Wow, that's a super high salary for a startup. Are you also giving some equity?
                      
                  
      Not exactly, but you can choose to be paid partly/fully in bitcoin, which is the best performing "stock" in 6 of the past 7 years (and could potentially keep performing as the number one for some years).
                      
                  
      the underlying mechanisms of that performance are hardly known and controllable, or even predictable, so that's nothing less but suggesting to play a lottery with your earnings.
                      
                  
      reading this I'm happy the OP didn't say they would pay the salary in the new crypto currency they were tasking you to create :)
                      
                  
      applying now. :)
                      
                  
      Applied!
                      
                  
      Hey, fellow job seekers!I've written a small chrome extension to help you filter the thread, check out: http://imgur.com/a/CzNSa.You can download it straight from the repo: https://github.com/viniciusCamargo/hn-chrome-extension/blob/...
                      
                  
      Very nice, but I can't seem to be able to install it?
Is it possible for you to post on the chrome store?
                      
                  
      Quick instructions on how to install this:1. Download the .CRX file2. Open the folder where the file was downloaded.3. Open Google Chrome. Type in chrome://extensions/ in the URL.4. In the Extensions page, ensure that Developer Mode is checked.5. From the folder, drag and drop the crx file to Chrome.6. A notification would appear that HN: WIH Search By Tags has been added.7. Enjoy.
                      
                  
      In the meantime you can follow these instructions: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked
                      
                  
      You should be able to install it through the "Load unpacked extension..." button if you have the "Developer mode" checkbox selected on the chrome://extensions page.
                      
                  
      Hey! I haven't posted to the Chrome Store yet because I was the only one using it so I didn't want to pay their fee. But I'll submit there next week.
                      
                  
      Awesome thanks! I already have a google dev account doing anything otherwise if you dont want to pay the fee.

      Hi, this is a complete non sequitur, but how's the tech sector in Montreal? Feel free to get rid of this comment if it bothers anyone, I was just curious. I never hear about tech and Montreal specifically, but there are several large scale interweb businesses there, including Pornhub... you guys get how many hits a day, plus have how mamy stream connections going at once? I have to imagine it's a fairly large number.
                      
                  
      The industry for developers in Montreal is large; it's nigh impossible to find oneself unemployed. However, the number of "big name" companies is quite small. MindGeek (owner of PornHub) is one, Google has an office, and the game studios are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head. So while the industry is large, most of it is small private businesses you've never heard of.The explanation as to why Montreal is a fairly busy tech hub likely has to do with salaries here vs. the expectation for equivalent talent in the US. Most companies here are actually American companies, and the only reason their offices are located here is because even senior developers tend to earn < $85k/year CAD, with $60-70k being more common. That's $48k to $70k/year USD vs. the $100-200k+ USD they'd have to pay within the US. Government incentives (looking at you, SR&ED) reimburse these companies a significant portion of developers' salaries, making it even cheaper. Canada is, for many American businesses, essentially a step above outsourcing to India.
                      
                  
      Montreal has a pretty hot tech scene given its population.There are a lot of game studios and other tech corporations like Google, Shopify, and so on.Also you can find many talented programmers in Montreal.
It is particularly enjoyable if you are looking for a really diverse city both culturally and technically.
                      
                  
      The high tech finance sector is non negligible also.
                      
                  
      Montreal has many video game developers: https://techvibes.com/2010/05/26/10-biggest-video-game-devel...More recently, a lot of investment starting to go into AI: http://montrealgazette.com/business/how-montreal-aims-to-bec...
                      
                  
      Some questions:* Would you consider your development team diverse?* What is the office environment like?* Have any stars come to visit?* What's the weirdist thing you've seen or that's happened at work?

      Super interesting. Bookmarking for a potential move to Seattle in 6-12 months.
                      
                  
      Don't underestimate the rain in winter. I moved here 9 months ago. Toughest few months of my life.
                      
                  
      Surely better than snow in winter. I prefer the weather I saw in Vancouver to the weather in Toronto any day.
                      
                  
      No way. Rain is wet and you can't do anything in it, it gets gloomy after a day. Snow enables all kinds of activities and you can dress for it and clean up by brushing yourself off, it's so beautiful it takes weeks or months before it gets gloomy.
                      
                  
      Last October '16 was greatest total volume of rain to fall and November was darkest (lowest UV penetration).  Fall/Winter are tough here especially if you're impacted by Seasonal Affected Disorder (SAD).

      Built For Me Inc. | Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Remote | Senior Software Engineer | Full Time | $150k-$250kWho we are: We are a small company loathe to use the word â€œstartupâ€�. The phrase that most aptly describes us is â€œboutique consulting firmâ€� as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.Technologies:NodeJS / JavaScriptBabel / ES6RDMS: MySQL / PostgresAmazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3SlackGitHubApache Aurora / MesosTerraformDockerWeâ€™re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.https://www.builtforme.techhttps://blog.builtforme.techApply via AngelList: https://angel.co/builtforme-1/jobs/274547-senior-software-en...
                      
                  
      "Sufficient personal network to apply to work at Built For Me via a personal recommendation rather than just submitting an application through AngelList."This is vile.
                      
                  
      This is the way it works pretty much anywhere. A personal recommendation from a trusted employee or someone they know is worth a lot more than an application submitted from someone unknown.They're just explicitly stating that although knowing the right people is not a requirement, it will work a lot better in getting you in the door.My current company, in fact, has grown almost entirely from employee recommendations, and it has worked out well. The fact that you know someone is good from previous experience greatly reduces the chance of getting someone who doesn't work out.

      I visited their office. Stiffest interview I've had in memory. One guy transcribed my answers on his laptop "so there's no question about what you said, and we can analyze your answers later". Nothing negative ever said, and when I asked for feedback, I got a glare. Choice quote: "Some of this security stuff is just too much, man." I got the impression that they were just going through the motions of interviewing and not very serious about hiring.

We're particularly looking for people with strong front-end skills, with an eye for design and UX. This means that either you identify as a frontender, or as a full-stack developer.WRITER / CONTENT MARKETER: We're looking for a passionate technical writer / content marketer. No deep tech skills needed, but an affinity with tech is required. This is your chance to design & carry a young startup's content marketing effort.Content already drives a significant chunk of our growth, but there's still a lot of room for us to get better at it. Our product is technical in nature, so some of that content will need to be technical in nature too. We're looking for someone who loves producing the kind of useful content (insights, tutorials, analyses, etc) that enterpreneurs and programmers in our target audience really need. Not fluff promo pieces or useless Twitter spam.ABOUT TALKJS: Our team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don't apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don't apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.We prefer on-site for both positions, but remote is OK as long as you're max 2 hours away from Eindhoven so we can meet often. Eindhoven has a great low-cost airport so this includes a fair share of Europe.Apply or ask questions through the chat popup on our website.

      Outreach (https://www.outreach.io) | Software Engineer | Seattle | ONSITEI found Outreach last year on a "Who is hiring?" thread myself and joined the team shortly thereafter. I'm now the lead for one of our two platform teams and I'm looking to hire experienced software engineers to help us scale our backend systems.Outreach is a sales engagement platform. We've got great customers (https://www.outreach.io/customers/) and have raised around $60M to date (through a series C round). We just moved into a new office in the Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle. We pay competitive market salaries and offer excellent benefits. For example, I just returned to work from four weeks of paternity leave and was welcomed with eight weeks of paid postpartum doula support; I can't express how thankful my family was to have four well-rested nights of sleep each week.Our team is working to scale our monolithic Ruby on Rails application as our customer list continues to grow. We own our core CRM, API platforms, background frameworks and our bidirectional syncing systems with Salesforce. In addition to Ruby/Rails, we use MySQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch and Redis.For the backend role, I am particularly interested in individuals with strong software design/architecture skill sets and those who excel at managing complexity.Please reach out to ted.kimble@outreach.io if you are interested. We also have a number of other engineer opportunities available, including roles in front-end development (React), data science and machine learning. See our careers page for all job details: https://outreach.io/company/careers/.

      Weedmaps | Irvine, CA | Tucson, AZ | Denver, CO | Remote | Frontend (React, Next.js, GraphQL) | Backend (Elixir, GraphQL, Ruby on Rails)Come join the World's largest cannabis tech company! We're hiring across the board, have tons of interesting engineering challenges, and get to work with an absolutely cutting-edge stack. If you love building awesome things with cool people, we want to hear from you!https://weedmaps.com/careers
                      
                  
      I was given the perma-ignore treatment by a Talent Acquisition rep at WeedMaps for a SWE position that was effectively a subset of my existing job (I exceeded the listed requirements) after providing a resume.The resume should have clearly shown my qualifications, but did include some very old stuff including dozens of PHP sites.Not sure if ageism, poor resume optimization, or something else but feedback was (and still is!) welcome.
                      
                  
      Maybe they ran out of rolling paper, and your resume was used instead.
                      
                  
      I didn't see any remote openings on the site- should this be listed as remote?
                      
                  
      I applied to a Front End Engineer position last month and was told that the position was put on hold. Any word on that? Really interested in the position!
                      
                  
      Things have recently changed, please try again if you are still interested!
                      
                  
      i'll do that. thanks
                      
                  
      Are you open at all to marketing roles in Denver or is it strictly engineering?
                      
                  
      Hi jsonne! Several of our engineering roles are listed as being in Irvine, when in fact they're remote as well. I'm not 100% sure if it's the same for marketing roles, but I would encourage you to apply!
                      
                  
      Tucson, AZ and Denver, CO locations as well ;)
                      
                  
      FWIW I had a friend apply to a 'remote' position here and they turned him down because that team decided they didn't want to have remote employees after all. Be wary of the remote tag on this post.
                      
                  
      I'm sorry about your friend's experience. As a fully remote employee, I can assure folks that "remoteness" has become a much bigger part of our culture. We try very hard to make sure that remote folks are comfortable and kept in the loop. I'm not sure what team he/she applied for, but I would encourage them to give us another look!

As part of our interdisciplinary, international team you will work on Apache Spark to solve real Big Data problems and optimize our processes. Besides designing and building our new architecture you will convert new business requirements into data processes as well as help maintain our Big Data systems. You will be a mentor to our Data Engineer as well as another Data Engineer we are currently looking for.We are around 30 people in the company, half of the team works on tech positions. 15 employees are male, the other 15 female. The ADEX is based in Berlin with a small customer support team based in Hamburg. We are pretty flexible and chilled, and very tech- and product-focused. We work in a cutting-edge industry, so we encourage our employees to try new technologies, go to meet-ups, workshops and conferences. We are not afraid of trying and failing because we strongly believe in learning from mistakes.If you have any questions, please get in touch: elena@theadex.com
