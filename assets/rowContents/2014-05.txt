      matasano - always hiring, never replying to emails. I passed the crypto challenge and took the suggestion to apply - no answer. So I asked tptacek why they didn't reply - he said that was definitely a mistake, and I should send my application again. Of course again I got no answer. The crypto challenge was enjoyable though, so thanks for that I suppose.
                      
                  
      Are you hitting my spam filter or something? We have a group of 4 people that work together to handle the mail we get at careers@. If you send something and get no response, you can escalate, like you're doing here.(I can't answer the question I just asked myself, because I have no idea who you are. Sorry!)I don't know what else to tell you. We don't ignore mail to careers@. For instance: the H1B cap is now closed for the year, but we're still replying to people who would need a visa to work in the US.
                      
                  
      It occurred to me a minute ago to tell someone else to mail me at my personal address; you can do that too if you like. I'm thomas at sockpuppet.org. Pretty sure that won't get spam filtered.
                      
                  
      I'm curious as to whether you have some further complication than spam filters here. I got as far in your pipeline as answering one email about what location I'm interested in, and then heard nothing more. This might not be news, but if you're having trouble getting other messages it also might be worth knowing.
                      
                  
      Why don't you consider some alternative work-around visas? Like L-1. And you can fallback to H1B when those become available again.
                      
                  
      We do; we have on-staff immigration people. It's not always possible.
                      
                  
      "always hiring, never replying to emails". I applied for a position in NYC last year and I never heard back from them.
                      
                  
      I've emailed/tweeted at you a few times and got no responses. I really wanted a job/internship at Matasano Chicago. Eventually I got through to somebody to schedule a call with me only to have the call canceled and was told I wasn't a good fit before even saying anything to anybody.Even with that experience... I still would like an opportunity.
                      
                  
      Can you email me directly at thomas at sockpuppet.org? That's my personal mail account --- in case people are getting spam filtered. I want to find out what happened there.We did get a bajillion internship applications this year, and I believe we may have capped out on them, but we should have handled that gracefully regardless. If we scheduled a call, we owed it to you to actually get on the phone. I apologize.
                      
                  
      Email sent. Thanks.
                      
                  
      I sent an email asking about the crypto challenge but didn't get a reply :(  My email is my username @ gmail.
                      
                  
      A few months ago I asked you why you don't do remote work. I followed up with an email. I realize you're busy, but still I would have appreciated an answer, since you asked me to send you an email anyway.
                      
                  
      We're an office culture. We're constantly getting into situations where we hit technical challenges we haven't solved before, but someone else in the office has. Several times a day you'll see people crowd around someone's computer trying to work through some bug or misbehavior to see if we can, as a group, turn it into something exploitable. That's reason #1.Reason #2 is fairness. Some of our work is on-site. We arrange our offices so that we have "house accounts" in Chicago, NYC, and SFBA, and on any given day some fraction of the office is likely to be at one of those places. All things being equal, people would like to work from their own office instead of someone else's. If we pick up remote people, those people will by definition not be able to staff on-site projects, which mean that the people who actually come to the office will get stuck with that work.Reason #3 is that reasons #1 and #2 have been dispositive for us since 2005, and so we have a management structure tuned to that office culture. We're not set up to manage remote team members. We're especially concerned about this because some of us have experience working on assessment teams at "work from home" firms, and have seen wildly uneven results from projects managed like that. We're paranoid about quality and consistency the way a fine dining restaurant is paranoid about the consistency of dishes coming out of the kitchen.I'm not saying that there's necessarily anything bad about remote/WFH cultures, or that you couldn't build a good assessment firm doing remote/WFH. I'm just saying we haven't done it. :)
                      
                  
      Ok, thank you for answering.
                      
                  
      I am an early middle-aged "obsolete", "unemployable" American programmer who only has paid experience in pre .NET Visual C++.  Should I bother applying?
                      
                  
      I'd like to join the crypto challenge to see if I enjoy such work. Unfortunately, my email never got replied.
                      
                  
      Are you still doing the crypto challenge? I send you an email saying I want in but never got any reply.

      Clever (YC S12) is hiring full-stack engineers in San Francisco to hack educationSteve Jobs described education as one of the final frontiers still untouched by modern technology. Clever (https://getclever.com) is building the data platform needed for great software to make its way into the classroom. Just like Stripe has made it simple for developers to build payment processing into their apps, Clever has made it easy for developers to build applications for schools using student data.We're a small team of highly technical hackers with deep experience in education. Since releasing the Clever APIs in 2012, we've signed up the most innovative education companies as partners and deployed our platform to 1 in every 7 schools in America. Clever is making it easier for 4M students to use technology in the classroom, and that number is growing rapidly.We have all the usual SF startup perks: a beautiful loft office in SoMa, free lunch, and great benefits.  More importantly, youâ€™ll be working around a team of 24 smart, talented people (9 engineers) who are all equally committed to solving this particular problem.Weâ€™re always pushing each other to learn new things, both technical and nontechnical - in the past few weeks weâ€™ve done collaborative tech talks on things like:-exoplanets-kitesurfing-Magic: the Gathering-Regular Expressions for Regular People(We also play a lot of bughouse chess.)Weâ€™re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, weâ€™re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  Come help us change the classroom: https://clever.com/about/jobs
                      
                  
      Khan Academy â€” Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)We're a small, non-profit tech startup trying to give a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.Here's a testimonial we received last month:==================================Two year ago, I would never have imagined that any 13-year-old could be in Calculus BC. Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don't seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don't know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.==================================Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who're thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.
Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.You'll be part of a small team working alongside both "celebrity" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.Apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers and be sure to mention that you're coming from HN. Feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org if you have questions about applying or about KA in general. Unfortunately we can't sponsor visas right now unless you're from Canada, Australia, or Mexico.

      SpatialKey - REMOTEQA LeadWeâ€™re looking for someone to lead QA for SpatialKey. Weâ€™re a small 100% remote team of ~15 people. We create SaaS mapping and datavis software. Our largest vertical is the insurance industry, where we sell software to visualize large amounts of data and assess the impact of natural disasters, like tornado strikes, flooding, hurricanes, etc.Youâ€™d be in charge of QA for the entire product. Youâ€™d start off managing one other QA resource, with the expectation that you would grow that team as we need it. Youâ€™d need to be very hands on and able to automate much of the QA process. We expect you to be able to write code to automate tests and come up with ways to make QA more efficient. Coming up with and executing test plans, working directly with the dev team to dig into issues, etc.Weâ€™re profitable and entirely self-funded, so no VC breathing down our neck. Weâ€™re building a long-term business and are incredibly proud of what weâ€™ve accomplished in the 7 years weâ€™ve been at it so far.Full job post: http://blog.spatialkey.com/2014/04/hiring-qa-engineer-at-spa...More info about us on our blog: http://blog.spatialkey.com or see our 2013 year in review post: http://blog.spatialkey.com/2014/01/what-we-did-in-2013/doug.mccune@spatialkey.com or jobs@spatialkey.com to apply

      Heh, to be fair he's a part-time QA guy that we share with our sister company. So he's available to help us in a part-time capacity when able. But no, I call him Hamad when I actually discuss him with our team :)That's not meant to excuse a term you think is insulting, but just like we often refer to our customers simply as users, I don't think that using the word resource to describe someone's role in the company is a bad way to talk about someone's involvement.
                      
                  
      Sheffield, UK (possibly remote) - Delver - http://delver.ioWe're hiring a developers to help bring powerful natural language querying to every dashboard and reporting system in the world.We use Clojure day-to-day, but we'd be happy to talk to clever programmers with a background in other JVM or functional languages. NLP experience (academic or practical) would be great, but a CS background is a must. If youâ€™ve been exposed to data warehousing and business intelligence systems in the past without being driven insane that's another plus.Our team is based in Sheffield, Yorkshire â€“ the greenest city in the UK, less than two hours from London. We have burritos â€“ it's a real place â€“ but we spend some time working remotely and weâ€™d work to accommodate the right candidate anywhere in the UK.Get in touch with me, Thom Lawrence at thom@delver.io if you'd like to chat.

      Hey, get in touch if/when you're back in these parts. There's a small but increasingly convincing startup community here.
                      
                  
      Will do :) it's ever-tempting to go back and set up there. Cheaper, arguably a lot nicer and more fun than London, but currently the big smoke still has its claws in me.

We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook, and have as flat a structure as we can.We're looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.We're also looking for engineers for Developer Success and Developer Awareness positions. Since we have an incredibly technical product, and selling directly to developers, the dev-awareness positions (think marketing, but much more dev-oriented: dev evangelism, writing interesting blogs, CRO, analytics, etc - think a patio11-style engineer) require significant development experience. Dev-success positions are a good fit for engineers who like working with people and building relationships with customers.Check out our jobs page at https://circleci.com/jobs.

      Evidence.com - SeattleAt Evidence.com we build technology for law enforcement that is dramatically changing the way police agencies operate.  We created the Axon wearable camera system, and its accompanying cloud service Evidence.com, to record video from an officer's perspective and document exactly what occurred during each interaction with the public. We're already managing petabytes of digital evidence for law enforcement agencies, but there is an opportunity to have a much bigger impact on law enforcement with technology.  Everything from wearable biometric devices, to predictive policing with big data, to better mobile devices and software for officers to use in the field.Our tight-knit software team is based in Seattle, and is made up of engineers with a variety of backgrounds at companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and small startups.
                      
                  
      Made this comment when I first heard of your service, and would like to know your company's perspective:Any evidence you capture via this method should be immediately and freely available to any person involved in the incident with the police. If the cops pull me over for anything - I should have immediate access to all their recorded raw footage.If your company is against this, then I have a very fundamental problem with the trustworthiness of your company.Also - if any cop is wearing your equipment - then any person they interact with should have the reciprocal right to record the interaction as well.What is Evidence.com's official stance on this?

Our goal is to build out great data intelligence about people, the people they do business with, and the industries they operate in.Two of the things we do right now: help founders raise funding by analysing investment behaviour, and figuring out who's likely to be interested in their specific startup -- and which of those investors they already know. We also help companies get acquired by matching them with acquirers who want their skills and products.We're opening our beta tomorrow(!) and we're moving fast -- there's a lot of potential for impact and real serious contribution. So fast we don't have a /jobs page yet. :)Data EngineerLooking for engineers with solid Python experience to work on one or more of: data API integrations, data modelling, machine learning and classification, NLP, API design, visualisations.
