Khan Academy | Mountain View, CA or REMOTE | full-time and internshipsWe're bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.Over the past 10 years we've gone from Sal's family project to a global institution reaching 100+ million students annually. And the testimonials we receive every day remind us that our impact isn't just about big numbers â€” access to free education meaningfully changes the lives of people in all sorts of situations. (In a recent survey, 64% of first generation students at selective colleges said that â€œKhan Academy has had a meaningful impact on their educationâ€�.)We face intense challenges in providing access to students across the world (think: everything from videos to interactive content, in and out of classrooms, in all the most important languages, on all the most important devices). We use our data to personalize students' learning and continually improve our content. We're trying to build a strong, diverse team â€” and we need more help.We've made some great hires off HN and would love to make more. Especially if you're a designer or experienced engineer. Best way to apply is at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers. Mention HN.
                      
                  
      Do you guys hire remotely from all over the world or only US/Canada? I've been following the careers page for a few months anxiously and have been totally afraid to apply. Few days ago I checked, you guys had updated the remote options to only US/Canada. Hopes totally dashed since then.
                      
                  
      I had the same question a few months ago. Unfortunately working from Asia wasn't an option, but I'd still suggest reaching out since the Khan Academy folks are very helpful and encouraged me to interview if I was ever back in the US.
                      
                  
      I find that a lot of times people post here with "Remote" jobs. Then I contact them and they say "we're not looking for anyone in your area". Doesn't remote imply that the location doesn't really matter? I'm even in the US.
                      
                  
      Would a remote intern attending college in the fall/spring be able to set their working time to not conflict with their class schedule?

      Is that email address correct? :)
                      
                  
      My guess is the email is `comasp at sec dot gov` and the greeting should be extended to a person named Peter. (I haven't emailed them).
                      
                  
      Well I suppose this should count as my reading comprehension fail for the day.
                      
                  
      Given that the poster's email follows the format lastf@sec.gov (f for first initial), this is a consistent email for someone named Peter Comas.
                      
                  
      How do you guys deal with people in industry often getting paid more? The SEC would be a pay cut for many.
                      
                  
      115-200k would be a paycut?

      Hey, a friendly reminder. All positions pasted here available to search on the map.https://whoishiring.io/search/27.859/-37.178/2/
                      
                  
      Nice. This should be part of the actual post. :)
                      
                  
      Actually this would be genuinely great.Also would be cool if (maybe) we could use some sort of format for basic things.
I donâ€™t want to create new rules, this thread is good as it is. But If people want to use things like multiple locations, job title, company name I can make it happen.As far I can see people seems to be using something similar to this.COMPANY_NAME | TITLE | LOCATIONS [| Onsite ] [| REMOTE ] [| Visa] [|Other things]if the note could contain this suggestion (or similar) I could parse it way more effectively (I fix a lot of stuff here by hand)
                      
                  
      That seems to catch the basic gist. It could potentially end up forcing posters to follow the format. Question is, how can I help?
                      
                  
      Adding this probably has to be HN people initiative.But comments on the format and any feedback on the project itself are more than welcome.

      Smartcar | Backend Engineer | SF & Mountain View | OnsiteI'm an early employee at Smartcar. When I was job hunting back in the October, I looked at early stage startups in interesting spaces like eSports, VR, insurance, automotive etc. Smartcar is an automotive-related startup that's building the developer platform for the connected car.Smartcar is in a massive space (auto-related industry is 10% of US GDP), has a great team, is well funded with an amazing investor, we're making money and tons of other great early traction.We're looking to hire 3 engineers ASAP. Your voice will be heard and you will determine the company's technical roadmap.You should be a generalist who will be tasked with designing a modern API platform for cars, building secure web and API backends, integrating with testing, coverage and deployment pipelines and more. Our stack is Node.js, Postgres, Redis, Docker, AWS.$95K to $130K + up to 1.0% equityInterested? email me at Martin@Smartcar.com or call me at 415 404 5650
                      
                  
      Are you really called Smartcar? Is that not the name of the really really famous Mercedes backed micro-cars? Surely they won't let that slide...
                      
                  
      It's not, surprisingly: Their brand is "Smart"; I'm assuming we call them "Smart cars" because "Smarts" sounds weirder than "Toyotas."
                      
                  
      Trademarks are adjectives, not nouns. When you apply for a trademark, your lawyer will insist that you provide samples of marketing materials which use the mark as an adjective. So Toyota probably occasionally refers to "Toyota Automobiles", and I'd bet that Daimler's marketing refers to "Smart(tm) cars" all over the place... and they do, see google results for ["smart cars" site:smart.com]Looking at the Google results for [smart cars] and ["smartcars"], it boggles the mind that anyone would try to register a new mark in the auto sector like that. So much potential confusion!
                      
                  
      Trademark law generally covers you (sometimes after a lengthly legal battle) if there is a chance that you could be confused for the other party which in this case I clearly was. It was the first thing I thought in fact.
                      
                  
      "which in this case I clearly was. It was the first thing I thought in fact."FWIW, I made the same mistake. My first thought on reading the post was "How could he be an early employee of Smartcar if he started last October?  Those cars have been on the road for years..."Reading the rest of the post made it clear he was talking about something different, but though IANAL it seems like a pretty obvious trademark problem if they get big enough to be noticed by the maker of Smart cars, particularly since you can't just let trademark problems slide (unlike copyright, etc) without potentially weakening your trademark to the point where you lose it.
                      
                  
      Actual instances of customer confusion is the acid test. Been sued over tm. Have successfully C&D'd. Not a lawyer.
                      
                  
      interesting. people also said same thing about "Dropbox" vs "Box" as one was already around.I just did a trademark search, it looks like "Daimler" which is parent company of "Mercedes Benz" has registered "Smart" but not "Smartcar".

      I'm impressed; that's one useful and smooth looking interface you have there (just watched your demo)Anything in particular about your service that one would be hard pressed to find in another KM system?I'd say im pretty interested (in the frontend eng position) and will send you an email later (My name's Ben.)
                      
                  
      Thanks! That video is pretty old, too, I actually think the interface is nicer now in many ways :)We're unique in the sense that our primary value is aggregation and curation of other services. So you might use some KM system (like, say, Confluence) to write up a "how to set up your environment" guide, but you then use Pathgather to find, share, and track who has learned that piece of content. This works particularly well when your learning content spans many different websites, which is very common at large enterprises.Look forward to hearing from you!
                      
                  
      Props for actually posting salary ranges in the posting.
                      
                  
      You bet. Not quite "Buffer-level" transparency but we don't want to pretend we're dumping bags of cash on folks; we're actually pretty focused on building a sustainable business, giving employees lots of freedom, etc.
                      
                  
      DTU Biosustain | Copenhagen Area, Denmark | Onsite | Full-time | VISAFront-end Web Developer for Synthetic Biology Design PlatformWith advances in synthetic biology, genomes can now be edited at unprecedented speed and fidelity allowing making multiple changes in the same genome at the same time. This increases the need for computational tools to design cells and communities of cells analogous to the tools used in Computer Aided Design (CAD) of cars, buildings and other man-made objects. The European Commission has awarded 6.3 million Euros to a four-year collaborative project to build a CAD tool for data-driven design of cells and microbial communities. Applications will range from human health to sustainable production of chemicals.Our web stack currently, in no specific order: AngularJS, ECMAScript 6, Redis, Python 3, Flask, PostgreSQL 9.4, Socket.IO, Docker. The application is very front-end centric so most of the work will always be done in JavaScript. The API is written in Python and our scientists write most of their algorithms in Python. We currently use AngularJS for the front-end, however this is not set in stone.

Our primary need is on the Linux/Apache stack, but broader experience is always a plus.We need someone that takes ownership over what theyâ€™re working on, and can work independently to bring projects to closure. PS, like many posters here, we don't really care where you went to school or what other companies you've worked for either.

      Dataquest | San Francisco, CA | Data Engineer | Full-time | Onsite or RemoteAt Dataquest (https://www.dataquest.io), we're building the future of online education.  Most online learning has turned into "let me throw up a bunch of videos and call it a course".  We help people actually learn and demonstrate their skills (we're all self-taught).  Our paths take people from zero coding knowledge all the way through to getting jobs at companies like 3M and Fitbit.  Our cohesive curriculum, interactive learning by doing approach, project focus, and strong learning community are critical to this process.We're constantly trying new learning techniques and refining our approach.  We're profitable and control our own destiny, so we have a lot of latitude to do what's best for our students, not what's best for VCs.We've been teaching data analysis and data science to tens of thousands of students a month, but we want to expand into teaching data engineering.  Because we teach interactively, this both involves building backends (like Spark clusters), and teaching students how to use those backends in end-to-end data pipelines.This position will have a lot of autonomy in creating and building a data engineering curriculum.  Nobody is teaching data engineering well online, and this is a great way to shape the future of the field.  If you're passionate about building data infrastructure and teaching others to do the same, we'd love to chat.  We'd prefer strong knowledge in Python, Docker, and PostgreSQL at the minimum.Email me at vik at dataquest.io if this sounds interesting!

      David | San Francisco, CA | https://www.senddavid.com | FullÂ­time | OnsiteDavid is a San Francisco-Â­based software startup that combines technology and legal research to help customers resolve disputes with their cable, internet, or wireless service provider.The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.We currently have a MVP (https://www.senddavid.com) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80Â­-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-Â­4.0% | https://angel.co/david-174/jobs/72943-engineerContact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com

      REMOTE ONLY - GitLab 
We're hiring production engineers, developers, UX designers, and more, see https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/ 
We're a remote only company so everyone can contribute. GitLab is an open-source Ruby on Rails project with over 1000 contributors.
                      
                  
      My recent experience with Gitlab:Went through several interviews with them, including their technical interview and had a blast. Met some nice folks and was having a lot of fun interviewing with them.Was told, "I am confident that you would be a great addition to the team."Then I hit a wall when Sid (sytse here on HN) was unavailable to perform the next interview for an indeterminate amount of time. Ended up waiting 2 weeks between interviews.During that time I received an offer from another company and, asked if they could move things along or, perhaps, provide some timeline. At that time they made an informal offer via email.Then, there were two problems as I see it:1. The offer was significantly less than the floor I had given during the screening interview when asked about salary expectations. During that interview, the interviewer gave no indication that my expectations were out of line with Gitlab's salaries. [1]2. When I finally interviewed with Sid, there was no mention or acknowledgement that an offer had been made.My interview with Sid was tough, and definitely not what I was expecting after my earlier success interviewing with the company. Ultimately, he decided not to continue with my candidacy. I don't want to get into a "he said, she said" thing here, so I'll leave it at that.I hope this post does not come off as "sour grapes". My objective is not to trash anyone at Gitlab, there are a lot of great folks over there. I think there were some surprises in their process and I would have liked to have known these things upfront before I contacted them.[1] While I was still interviewing they edited their handbook to indicate that "Many of our team members who have joined have taken a decrease in compensation." https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#compens...
                      
                  
      Hi Locke,Thanks for the feedback. I'm sorry it took so long to schedule the interview with me. This was because of our company summit in Austin, but we should have made this clear to you up front.1. Currently we ask for compensation information early in the process (during the screening call https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/#screening-call ) and the person asking will note the information in our applicant tracking system. We don't give feedback at that time. We're working towards a global compensation structure where we can tell candidates the compensation earlier in the process. Due to having people in 26 countries this will take quite some time.2. I'm very sorry for this. I was not aware that an offer was made to you when I talked with you. The cause of the offer being made prematurely was that we wanted to inform you that we couldn't match your floor. Due to a misunderstanding between me and the person that made you the offer this was communicated to you as an offer instead of a heads up about the maximum compensation.I'm sorry you had a bad experience being interviewed by me. Your private feedback about this was great and I'll follow up with you about the changes we made to made future interviews better.I hope you're OK with me responding to your post. I assume it is OK since you're also posting in public.
                      
                  
      Hi Sid,Thanks for the follow-up. I appreciate it and I'm glad that my feedback might help improve your hiring process.I don't mind your comment, and I hope you understand that there are no hard feelings at all. I hope you understand that my goal is not to damage Gitlab or yourself in any way.I would like to say, I've been impressed by the openness and transparency at Gitlab, and I think this goes hand-in-hand with a desire to do the "right thing" in every way.It is with that in mind that I posted my experience, because I think there are problems with the way our industry approaches hiring (as seen in our poor diversity numbers, age discrimination, etc) and more openness can only help. I wish more people shared their experiences, and I wish more companies were open to refining their hiring processes.
                      
                  
      Thanks, we certainly hope that openess can help us improve faster. We're working on providing more information about our process to all participants in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/...

      The open positions listed on your website don't mention specific languages which is a good thing I guess. Am I right thinking that the main languages used for a System Developer are C++ and Golang ?
                      
                  
      Go and Java are the main languages used by us. We don't want to pass great engineers because they may not have experience with a specific language. We expect them to be willing to learn it if required (same for other technologies).
                      
                  
      Are all the positions available for remote work?
                      
                  
      We're open to experiment with remote candidates. We have 2 guys working outside the office locations I listed, but they are still in UK (Leeds, Edinburgh), where we have an office.
                      
                  
      Is remote working from Asia (India, to be specific) an option?
                      
                  
      Hi, for remote candidates, we are looking for proofs of remote capabilities. Open source projects, conference talks, any type of visibility. As we're based in Europe we prefer candidates in our own timezones, because we do collaborate on a daily basis.
Or somebody we already know and trust (did business somehow together).
                      
                  
      Are you looking for QA, Support or IT? I've provided all these remote and am ready to do so.

      GetCloak.com | Software Engineer | Hourly Contract | Remote (we're in Seattle)Cloak is a VPN network, and a set of apps (currently for iOS and OS X) designed to connect to this service.We are looking for a senior Android contractor to help us get our native Android app off the ground, and to get us in great position to grow our Android presence for many years to come.Right now there are just two of us developing the service. We differentiate Cloak by (1) providing a beautiful minimal UI and features like auto-secure that allow the VPN to fade into the background, (2) actually caring about the secure construction of our apps, our APIs, and our VPN network, and (3) going the extra mile, and then another, for our customers.Our ideal candidate has:1. Deep experience architecting complex new Android applications, and an innate understanding of the pieces that need to be put together to provide an experience that matches our current iOS and OS X apps.2. A keen sense of how they might build and interact with OpenVPN under the app's hood, how they can implement auto-secure reliably, how they can gracefully handle captive portal networks, etc.3. A curiosity about VPN networking, and an attention to detail to ensure that every security-critical decision the app needs to make -- from credential storage to networking configuration -- is made well.4. Experience with modern Android development tools and practices: for example, our ideal candidate is running Studio 2.1 right now (and might be playing with 2.2 canaries), is perhaps wary of using Fragments, already planned to start this app with appcompat, has played with or even used dagger2, retrofit and rxjava, butterknife, etc.5. Ideally, a love of graceful UI designs, and a willingness to make pixel-detail changes or tweak animation curves when it just doesn't feel right.This is a meaty project and we think it will be a fun challenge for the right candidate. We expect it will take real time to put together; our guesstimate is 4 full-time months, +/-1.5, but we'll work with you to refine this.We also expect we'll be working with you along the way to guide development and fill in blanks should it become necessary.Interested? Please get in touch with me! dave[at]getcloak[dot]com
                      
                  
      Multi year paid subscriber of Cloak. I've used this product on my macbook for years and it is hands down my favorite app on my laptop. I didn't realize how great it was until I tried to set my non-technical sister up with a VPN on her Windows laptop.Cloak is not like that. Not anything like that. It is beautiful, simple, no config necessary, and has great features.My biggest regret about choosing Android is that i couldn't use Cloak on my phone. Thrilled that Dave is looking to fix that, and I'm excited for you to come on and help the Android community enjoy the glory of Cloak.
                      
                  
      Thanks so much Zachary. You've been a strong supporter of Cloak since day zero and we've always appreciated it.
                      
                  
      I'm also a big fan of Cloak, multi-year customer & using Cloak right now while I post this from a cafe.  Dave & the Cloak team have been awesome to deal with as a customer, and Dave went way beyond in offering customer support on a very unusual corner case setup.  A company I was consulting with even referenced the Cloak team internally as a model for the kind of vendors they wanted to buy from in future.I wish my Android skills were better, because this is a dream job.  But I'm looking forward to the Android version & using it across all the Android devices I have next to my Mac.
                      
                  
      Wow, thanks so much Kohan -- this is really one of the nicest things I've read about Cloak in quite some time. Cheers!

      Senior Backend Developer (Haskell) | AlphaSheets | up to $150k (depends on level of hire and equity tradeoff) + equity | Bay AreaWe're building the future of spreadsheets: collaborative, programmable in multiple languages, and highly extensible. We think spreadsheets haven't reached their full potential as a general computing platform. We envision a world where many more people are able to code thanks to the intuitive interface of a spreadsheet, where non-technical and technical analysts can share the same interface to data, and where everything from fully-featured data analysis and visualization apps to new spreadsheet functions can be shared, Google-Sheets style, on the AlphaSheets platform. We're an ambitious company with plenty of runway.Short video demo: http://d.pr/i/jK28.gifIf you're an opinionated functional programming proponent who hacks in Scala, Clojure, or Haskell in their free time, that's a great sign of a fit. Experience is a plus, but not a must as long as you're really smart. Doesn't matter if you don't know Haskell as long as you can learn. We have a React/Flow/Haskell stack. We love seeking leverage through good architecture, languages (Haskell!), frameworks, and tools.You'll be joining a team of 4 MIT dropouts (among them, one owned a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin mine in high school, two were USA Math Olympiad winners, and one made ~$300k on stat-arb trading in high school).Email me (Michael Gao, CEO) at michael (at) alphasheets (dot) com

      I'm a Canadian student with lots of React experience. I'm looking for co-op/internships as part of my degree.Are you hiring co-op students/interns?Are you prepared to have a Canadian work for you? Has your company previously been good with international employees/sponsoring visas?How many people do you have in your office, and in what environment would potential hires be working?Do you have a fairly developed organizational structure, or is it more of a flat meritocracy?
                      
                  
      We aren't looking for interns at the moment, just full time employees.We haven't had any experience with international employees, and I'm unsure about how that would all work.We have about 20 in the company, of which 15 are in the office. We have some nice office space in down town Portland, Oregon. You'd be working in a collaborative space with the engineers.We have an organizational structure in that we have a CEO and CTO but I would say it's a meritocracy.

For example, many archaeologists may use the term â€œBronze Age,â€� yet each may define the spatial and temporal extent of that period differently. During the first phase of the project (funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities) we collected over 3500 of these time period definitions and developed a tool for curating them. The Institute of Museum and Library Services is now funding the next phase, which will focus on tools for visualizing differences and patterns among period definitions.We are hiring one part-time JavaScript developer who will help our two programmers (a PhD student and professor at the University of North Carolina) build interfaces that will allow our users to visualize, find, and curate relevant time periods for their work. This developer should have experience with React, d3, and modular JavaScript design. Familiarity with RDF would be beneficial. The time commitment is negotiable, although all work must be completed by May 2018 at the latest. All work will be remote.
