      Wow - this is exactly the kind of work I want to do. For two decades I've been writing boring software to make rich people richer.  I've been looking for a way to use my experience for something that really helps people.  It makes me wonder if there is a list of dev/tech opportunities for similarly impactful organizations.

      What does Blockchain Engineer do? Like implementing blockchain from scratch, or working on existing implementations? (Bitcoin, Ethereum) doing what? Fixing bugs mentioned in their issue tracker? Please elaborate what's the work day looks for such developer.
                      
                  
      Hi, not lordnacho but Iâ€™m one of Interdaxâ€™s eng leads.Mostly is about working on existing implementations but a deep understanding of how blockchains work is required. Weâ€™re looking for someone who can help to review and add new cryptos (for building trading pairs), work with the exchange wallets and  continuously track, evaluate and solve potential issues derived from bugs/vulns that appear from time to time in some cryptocurrencies.Weâ€™ve got the process already quite streamlined so itâ€™s more about optimising it and have more eyes reviewing internal and external code bases. Also experience with DEX architectures is a bonus (but not strictly necessary)
                      
                  
      I have the same question but just to know what a "Blockchain Engineer" does.
                      
                  
      Does remote friendly actually mean fully remote?
                      
                  
      Hi Claudio, yes, it means that the positions can be fully remote.
                      
                  
      PolicyStat | Full-Stack Python+Django Software Engineer | Indianapolis, Vancouver, or REMOTE | Full Time | +$80kPolicyStat's mission is to improve healthcare delivery through better processes. We help our clients make their policies and procedures easier to find, access, and manage.As a critical member of our small product team, you'll assume several roles including front-end, back-end, on-call support, API design, architecture, devops and database engineering.Full description + Apply here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IzGRolB036r89XAs3NK9A1_J...Some exciting things we're doing now that you can help with:- Full product/site mobile-first redesign using React- Switching from Python 2.7 to Python 3Interview Process:1. Application review.2. Complete a small timed work sample (no more than 45 minutes) in Python designed to represent what your day to day work would look like.3. Conversation with the Product team lead.4. Complete a timed work sample project (no more than 4 hours) that is representative of the kind of projects you'll be working on.5. On-site (or remote) culture conversation with the team + face to face interviews.
                      
                  
      > Interview Process:It is nice to see interview process spelled out in exact steps, it speaks for company clarity culture and it will unwind cognitive load on the candidate ..Google docs job desc is nice add-on to give job details instead of all pasting in job post
                      
                  
      It's also telling that a mid-level Engineering role makes you step through this many hoops for $80K/yr. Or that the refer to that as "market rate".
                      
                  
      $80k/yr is market for a starter mid-level position in Indianapolis. However, most of the city's talent is C# and JavaScript.ETA: that's probably the most rigorous interview process I've seen in Indy and seems a bit extra for anything other than a lead.
                      
                  
      For us, $80k is regarded as the entry-level starting base. A mid-level that makes it through our process has a much higher starting base.
                      
                  
      They say "market-based". It sounds like $80K in Indianapolis or the equivalent in your city.
                      
                  
      While also slipping "on-call support" in there too
                      
                  
      For what it's worth: The on-call support role is a 1-week obligation that rotates between all of the engineers on the team. As our sixth engineer, each engineer would only be on-call once every 6 weeks.The role itself consist of being the:- primary PagerDuty contact for server and application alerts and errors,- primary contact for our dedicated support team to ask questions and triage new issues,- primary code reviewerNote that we do have a dedicated support team that answers emails and calls from our customer base. The on-call engineer is not responsible for that.

      Game Closure | Engineer | SALARY: $120k - $220k | San Francisco Bay area (SF) | Tokyo, Japan | VISA REMOTEGame Closure is building the world's most advanced javascript game technologies, including an engine, server infrastructure, analytics and marketing, among other cool products. We are hiring senior engineers who can tackle architecture and APIs for our game technology on small teams of 3-4 folks. Game Closure has raised more then $30M, and has more than 100M users supported by a small team of engineers <25For flavor: our last project was to use redux as a server state timeline for 100M+ players; before that we used code mods to port it from our propriety module and class system to es6. There are numerous projects coming up, such as first class typescript support to facilitate better tooling and API documentation, a facial tracking/AR engine, and a react-powered webgl-based UI system.We have projects for hosted real-time multiplayer gaming, social gaming, cross-compilation to native platforms, and many other core infrastructure tools that we would welcome your support on defining and creating.Our technologies engine have already been in front of tens of millions of users, and we're adding millions of new users monthly. This is a high leverage position, and very senior. We welcome remote for certain folks, because we're looking to build the best small engineering team in the world, but we prefer to hire in Tokyo and Mountain View.We are also actively looking for folks across range of leadership roles in product, engineering, and operations.Please email linda@gameclosure.comSubject: Game Closure Engineering: YOUR NAME HEREPlease include a personal note about your background and interests so we can prioritize your application!
                      
                  
      I waited 21 days for my first reply from Game Closure after applying for this position 2 months ago. I proceeded to have three interviews, 2 of which were technical with a high level engineer and the CTO.After being told the interviews went very well, I never heard back. After a couple of weeks I emailed Linda and Rachel to ask for a status update, and never received a response.
                      
                  
      I interviewed with Game Closure for the engineering position. Passed 3 technical rounds with engineers and CEO, then was asked for reference. I agreed to provide my ex-boss's contact, they didn't call until more than 2 weeks later, then got a feedback that they received some "red flags" from the reference so they won't proceed. I couldn't believe it so I came to ask my ex-boss directly, whom I worked with for 2.5 years as lead developer and still maintain good relationship. He was shocked to hear that, and said he tried to give me the best feedback he could, then apologize and even tried to offer me some other gigs in exchange for the loss. Judging from the actions alone - GC had no desire to make the call until 2 weeks later and my boss trying to offer me jobs instead - I find it simply impossible to believe that GC had genuine interest in me and that my boss backstabbed me. If you don't want the candidate you should simply tell them, but if you can't find a good reason and decide to blame it on the reference despite the candidate's effort to provide whatever you need and risking their relationship, it tells a lot about you.
                      
                  
      How long ago did you interview with them? I have just started to get a first reply from them today (after submitting my resume).
                      
                  
      I got first reply around mid April. The whole process was more than 1 month. If you have more question feel free to DM.

      How does machine learning apply to something like astrology?
                      
                  
      They both require some faith in magic.  Half the companies claiming to use AI or machine learning are full of shit anyway.
                      
                  
      Astrology and machine learning just seem so different. One is a poor attempt at prediction using dubious, shoddy, poorly understood methods that generally amount either to general wooly vagueries or completely wrong conclusions that are no better than random chance, and the other deals with planets.
                      
                  
      Edit: Nevermind - I was thinking AstronomyI don't work there, but recently a new exoplanet was found using a neural net:https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/google-ai-helped-find-the-...
                      
                  
      This looks more like astronomy domain rather than astrology.
                      
                  
      Yep, you're right.  I misread.

      Nava | Infrastructure Engineers, Experienced Software Engineer - Backend | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC | On-site - Full-time | $100k-$180k+ + equity + benefits We're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why weâ€™re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteranâ€™s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.
Itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      Festicket | Festivals/Music/Ticketing | Mid Level+ Backend Engineers | London Central/NW | Onsite/Lots of remote daysDjango-Rest-Framework/Postgres/Redis/Celery in AWS. Have a pretty cool in house Slack bot for orchestration, that we should probs open source at some point.I'm a backend dev here, and we're finding it hard to get good people through the door. Once we chat with them, we almost always convince them to work here, but its very difficult getting people through the door. We're paying pretty well as well for London rates, 50-80k GBP for mid-senior guys, could probs convince the CTO's to pay more for the right candidate. The office is nice, engineering is a big part of the decision making process.Feel free to send me an email either at sam.holmesatfesticket.com or the (personal) email in my bio. Happy to video or text or w/e with anyone to chat morehttps://www.festicket.com/about/
                      
                  
      Just some feedback on why you might be finding it hard to get people through the door:- you say you hire guys, are you opening to hiring women or guys who don't want to just work with other guys too? (a little sarcastic, but language matters a lot)- referring to the coding test as "easy as shit" implies that candidates would be working with people who can only pass that level of test. I realise this may have been exaggeration, but it doesn't sell the job well.- there's no detail about what the company values, and the sort of people you want.- I find engineers are usually convinced by the product, tech, money, or culture. Your product sounds good in this respect (tell us more about it!), your tech stack sounds sensible, but probably not that likely to be the deciding factor, the salary is good, but not enough for those motivated by money, and you haven't got any details about the culture.
                      
                  
      Hey Dan,Yes of course we hire women. Would love to hire more. We have a few on the team at the moment, but women are definitely under represented. You're right I probs should avoid gendered terms, but I'm Australian and "guys" has always meant "group of people" to me, rather than a gendered term, though I realise that's not the way the rest of the world views it.Should mention that I don't speak for the company, especially with regards to recruiting, and am just a backend dev after more people, and figured I could post here in a less than official capacity.To me, as an engineer, the things I am interested in are:- Salary
- Who my boss is whether I trust them/think they are sensible.
- Engineering lead business. I.e engineering is a big part of the decision making in terms of what are priorities.I feel that this company is decent in all these regards.https://festicket.workable.com/j/7D1A4FF76AEdit:Thanks for the feedback btw, I'll tidy this up for when I post next month. Appreciate it.
                      
                  
      What's crazy to me is that 80K GBP (about 100k USD) is considered a very good salary in the UK for mid-level/senior people. That's not even new grad levels in the states...
                      
                  
      Cost of living is a lot lower. 25-30 days holiday a year + 10 bank holidays. Far less grindy hours (obviously varies from place to place).The big money gigs are in London are in contracting, where people can make 500-1k a day for 3-6-12 month contracts. The market for that is far higher.
                      
                  
      Interview process:Phone call with CTO (15-30 minutes) -> easy as shit online assessment (30 minutes) -> On site chat with 2 Devs + CTO, minimal whiteboarding, no "gotchas" -> Offer.
                      
                  
      Are you looking for graduates at all by any chance?
                      
                  
      Honestly, at this point we would probably consider it, given the right graduate. Some graduates are better than people with 10 years exp.The lack of good talent is real. I hope this drives salaries up a bit!

      Strive Talent | Full-stack Engineer + Front-end product engineer | FULL-TIME ONSITE | San Francisco, CA | https://www.strivetalent.com/Hey HN!

My email is jesse@strivetalent.com.Strive Talent is a seed-stage, mission-driven startup dedicated to giving everyone a fair shot at a great career.
Right now we help companies around the US staff sales and customer support jobs with candidates that would typically be overlooked.  A typical hiring manager spends ~6 seconds per resume to evaluate whether a candidate should be given an interview.
Instead, we administer a combination of cognitive tests, work-sample tests, and phone screenings, which allow us to evaluate a candidate according to the traits that actually determine their ability to do the job.Our team is small, but we're well-funded: https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/stressing-aptitude-over-ac...If you're interested, please send a resume and a paragraph explaining what it is about Strive that resonates with you to: jesse@strivetalent.comStrive is a great place to join if any of the following are true:â€¢ You care about connecting people with dignified livelihoods.â€¢ You care about people getting jobs based on their ability to do the work, and not their pedigree.â€¢ You want to come in to work each day and be able to ask, "How many people got a better job yesterday because of us?"â€¢ You want to join an early-stage startup where there are still a lot of open product and technical questions.Our core platform is built using Rails, React, PostreSQL, and other standard moving parts.  Experience is those technologies isn't required, but evidence of skill and adaptability are.
