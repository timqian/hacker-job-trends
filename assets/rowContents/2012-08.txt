NYC (Union Square) - Chicago - SFBay (Mountain View)Matasano.Job title: Scary Story Told To Young Software Developers By Their Parents To Get Them To Go To Bed On Time.We break software. To do it, in the past year, we've filled up Riak clusters with raw HTTP requests, built a large-scale source code cross referencer for 30 languages, wrote and rewrote a debugger core in Ruby, wrote another in Go, built software fuzzer farms with Redis, tested 3 different proprietary trading protocols, broke sandboxing schemes, built tools to attack chipsets, broke numerous cryptosystems, and gave several talks at Black Hat.Our customers are excellent; they include Github, 37signals, and numerous YC companies.Our team is even better. What are we looking for? Here's my first interview question: "what is your research project going to be for us?" Does this stuff interest you? We should talk. WE LOVE TALKING TO DEVELOPERS. You don't have to be a "rock star ninja shaolin grandmaster security pro", wear the right jeans, or listen to Animal Collective (please don't listen to Animal Collective). We just want you to be able to learn fast and not get scared when you're faced with wacky systems in languages you've never used and there's a clock ticking.Downsides: Not building things people want. In fact, building things people fear and loathe. Also, not being able to wear silver, eat garlic, or enter houses without express invitation.Perks: Infinite free tech books, medical, dental, vision, 401k.If I were looking for a day job, I wouldn't be looking for a day job any more: they're friendly, happy people who get social license to join the Dark Side, do smart stuff all 
day, and then go home while it is still light out. - HN:patio11More than you ever wanted to know about our recruiting process:http://www.matasano.com/careers
                      
                  
      Thomas, it's really hard to believe that it's not easy for you to find developers considering what you have to offer. I wish I had an interest in breaking things (I would rather build great software), I would have definitely applied.
                      
                  
      You guys have just been acquired, right?

      Adzerk - Raleigh-Durham, NCWe're a small, but fast-growing startup working on a revolutionary Internet advertising platform. We're looking to hire an engineer who is interested in working in a fast-paced environment geared around continuous learning and personal responsibility.As an engineer at Adzerk, you'll work on all parts of our system, from the front-end web UI to the engines that serve the ads. Our system uses C# (Mono), ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, MongoDB, Hadoop, and RabbitMQ, and we're experimenting with investing heavily in Node.js, Redis, and ZeroMQ. Performance and scalability are our two primary concerns, and with the traffic and growth rates that we're experiencing, lots of the lessons that you've learned start to break down. Because of that, it's not as important what you know right now â€“ what matters is how quickly you can learn and adapt.* Your work will have an immediate and profound impact on our product and business.* We ship code dozens of times a week, and you will write code and push to production on your first day.* You will be responsible for making important decisions about what tools and libraries we use.* We prize open source contribution. You should have a GitHub account already.* Unlimited vacation. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace.* Flexible work schedule, including working at home part-time if you want.If you think you might be a great fit, drop us a line at jobs@adzerk.com.
                      
                  
      Why do companies say they are in Raleigh-Durham and they are in Durham or vice versa?  Why not just say Durham?Even worse are the ones that say Raleigh and they are in Durham or Cary.Do companies in other cities do this same misdirection?
                      
                  
      Most of us actually live in Raleigh so we want to make sure people searching for Raleigh in the thread find us. (from North Raleigh it's about the same time to either Downtown Durham or Downtown Raleigh)
                      
                  
      It's just an annoying convention around here. My best guess is because the street address can be one of 5 or 6 cities (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary, Wake Forest, Morrisville, Apex, etc) and so people talk in terms of the metropolitan area which is Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill or the "triangle".
                      
                  
      I think it's because of the airport code (Raleigh-Durham/RDU). Because of that, people who aren't from the area think that the two cities are a lot closer than they actually are.As a former Durham native, I've always said Durham-Raleigh. :-)
                      
                  
      Well for techies it seems it should be Durham-Raleigh, because most of the jobs are there.  I don't consider RTP to be a real place it is really just Durham.

      Menlo Park, CATranscriptic: Core Developer or Automation EngineerTranscriptic is the "Amazon Web Services" for life sciences.  Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way.  Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use.  Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another.  We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development.We're a very small startup (you'd be #3), but well funded and have customers.  You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.  The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.max at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/

We're more than that, though, and we're looking for a couple people to help us take it to the next level.We're hiring for two positions right now:Front-end Engineer:We want someone who is in to javascript, HTML, CSS, and maybe a bit of photoshop. We've grown our API, but our customer-facing site is lagging a bit. Specifically we want to present our analytics data in a better way. We've got more in the pipe, of course, but details are sparse for now.---Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning Engineer:As I mentioned above, we're looking to take our API to the next level. NLP/ML is going to be a large part of this. We have access to a fantastic amount of data, and we want someone to help us leverage it.Right now we have some NLP/ML stuff dealing with textual content extraction. We want to do some semantic analysis and categorization to come up with information that is useful to our customers.---Our team is still small, fewer than 10 people, so you'll mostly be doing your own driving when it comes to your projects.Despite the small team, we have a serious customer base, and are actually making money.We aren't able to sponsor candidates from outside the US, sorry.Get in touch! team@embed.ly

This is not your mother's enterprise software!Actifio has been invested in by top VC firms (one of the very few East Coast companies in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio) and is growing super fast.We're always looking for smart engineers in every team, but since I'm on the deduplication team, I'll have to pitch you on that :)Dedup seems like an easy problem to solve. Split the data up into blocks and make sure you only store one of each. But at scale, it becomes a whole different animal.When you've got 128TB of 4KB blocks, you have 32 billion unique blocks of data to manage. Making our dedup ingest, restore, and garbage collect fast is a great challenge, especially with "only" 128 GB of RAM.If you'd like to chat about a job opportunity, I'm at chris.murphy@actifio.com. Since I'm an engineer, I'm not going to type a list of silly requirements. Just send me a resume and whatever else you think I'd like to know.

      SF - Rails/JS - HALF-TIME-ISH :)I've mentioned before that we have a few engineers who work half-time-ish (and do their own things the rest of the time) and it got some positive feedback: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3850480We're ready to hire a couple more in this vein, so if it sounds interesting let me know!=========Advantages for you:- you get 2-3 extra weekend days for fun and profit- we provide health insurance and all that jazz- if some weeks you don't have lots to do and want to work more, and other weeks you have lots to do and want to work less, we can be flexible- we're profitable and growing! so if you decide "wow I really love Verba and want to spend every waking moment there" we can make that dream come trueAdvantages for us:- you have more time to learn new things, meet new people and generally be a friendlier, happier, more knowledgeable person in our workplace- we can hire faster with less anxiety (instead of the "gulp i just committed $100k/yr" feeling, we have the "smaller gulp i just committed $50k/yr" feeling :)- you get to be a part of what we're doing, we get to hear about all the cool stuff you're doing, and that can only lead to good things for both of usAnyway, I've included our spiel and "what we're looking for" summary below, so shoot me an email if you're interested (ragalie@verbasoftware.com).========The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.We're a B2B company working with around 225 colleges and universities, and we're looking for people familiar with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck.The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.Be sure to check out our website (http://www.verbasoftware.com) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us.

Our current team is very small and weâ€™re looking for a hand-on, generalist who will get things done.   You will work on a variety of subsystems, some are existing codebases (with other users and developers) that need modification for our application, while other projects are new and specific to our group.

      Guildford, UKMyDrive SolutionsWho are we?MyDrive provides data analysis services for insurance telematics. We collect GPS data from black boxes installed in cars, and from smartphone apps, and we analyse it to work out how well you are driving, so insurers can provide a fair price for insurance. This means that good drivers can get cheaper car insurance. We work with RoSPA in the UK for driver behavioural research into what constitutes good driving. We have customers and commercial pilots across Europe and South Africa with a range of global insurance companies, brokers and aggregators.Our processing engine is predominantly Ruby 1.9, with a Rails (3.2, rspec, cucumber etc) API frontend backed by Postgres. Redis and Resque power the processing queue, and we occasionally drop down to C++ for some number crunching (normally libs wrapped up in FFI Ruby bindings). We've got Cassandra for large scale querying and storage, and we manage all of this on AWS using Chef. We use Github, Campfire, Hubot, and Janky for code, collaboration and CI.Who are we looking for?We've potentially got a few vacancies over the next few months as more customers launch, but right now we're looking for a systems lead who can help keep our infrastructure running 24/7 as we grow, and also help our customers integrate with us. Ideally someone with experience of running large web services on AWS using Chef.If you'd like to know more, email me: gavin dot heavyside at mydrivesolutions dot com
                      
                  
      Berlin, Germany ("H1B") - StorageRoom - iOSWeâ€™re building a cloud-based Content Management platform thatâ€™s targeted at developers. We just received funding from prestigious VCs (unannounced).You say Content Management sucks? Thatâ€™s exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps.
The initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies.Itâ€™s now time to throw away the prototype of our API and to build a high-performance solution, from scratch. We already have a team for the backend and are now looking for an iOS developer who will create an iOS SDK and example applications.Weâ€™re looking for someone who already has a solid experience in writing and testing iOS applications and that has a good knowledge of the iOS ecosystem and its frameworks (CoreData etc.). You should have a good Computer Science foundation and an authentic interest in working with Objective-C and Cocoa. One of the main jobs besides developing will be to involve the iOS community with talks at conferences and interesting prototypes.Interested? Please send your GitHub account and any other interesting links about you to sascha@thriventures.com.P.S.: The only language in the company is English and living in Berlin without any knowledge of German isn't a problem at all.

      San Francisco, fulltime systems/ops and engineering, Causes - http://www.causes.com/joinusAt Causes, use your programming powers to help nonprofits effect change on the world! Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 12-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc. Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from - every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer- over the last 4 months, we've upgraded from Rails 2.1 to 3.2.3 and are using the static asset pipeline, SASS/Compass, and HAML. We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. We gave a presentation on the upgrade at last weeks SF Rails meetup, slides at causes.github.com/migrating-rails-talk- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise (aka study hall)- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselvesCauses is a great place to better yourself and better the world. We're particularly looking for a systems/ops/network engineer to help wrangle our colo. Apply through the site or adam@causes.com if interested!

      Location: Mountain View, HackerRank.comWhat?
Imagine a room in SF where all the top engineers from Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. come by everyday and spend a couple of hours? The value of that room is incredibly high.
Now, let's expand the room to contain the best problem solvers (hackers, PhDs, math studs from Weizmann, etc.) across the globe hanging out every single day. This room has the potential to define how the world functions.At HackerRank.com we're building this room online.How?
Every programmer has something that attracts her to code - bot-vs-bot contests (eg: aichallenge.org), functional programming challenges (eg: 4clojure.com), quick hacks over twitter API's, etc. This can be for fun or to learn a particular programming concept or anything in programming (eg: vimgolf.com has greatly improved my vim skills)We're taking the complete experience and adding an interesting social component to it. It's going to be a fun place for programmers to hang out.Team:
We're a young team at Mountain View, recently funded by Y-combinator and a top VC firm. You'll be an early engineer in a real hardworking team of hackers. Our culture is defined more on persistence than "talent".Tech stack:
We use ROR, backbone.js, coffeescript, neo4j, EC2.Preview: youtu.be/-p44yPm2wy0Apply:

      San Francisco, IOS Developer. Full Time.
Weâ€™re inventing a new kind of photography for when photos just arenâ€™t enough. Close your eyes and imagine your favourite memory - say christmas morning as a kid. Youâ€™re probably not thinking of a rectangle in a void (i.e. a picture), nor are you thinking of a moving rectangle in a void (i.e. a movie), youâ€™re probably thinking of an entire world that youâ€™re standing in the center of. We make an IOS app that allows you to save this entire moment into a seamless spherical photograph called a bubble that you can save and share with others.Weâ€™re a small, four person team - including the intern who made Yelpâ€™s Monocle, a designer from Cooper Union and a computer vision genius. We raised $2 million in a heavily oversubscribed round of funding from August Capital. We spoke at TED (sorry, no video!), have offices on union square in San Francisco and have an app that has an unparalleled ability to induce uncontrolled smiles of glee when people first see it.Weâ€™re looking for someone to be our point person for IOS development. We actually all have IOS experience (and a really cool app in progress), but weâ€™re looking for someone to grab the bull by the horns and focus on IOS full time (as the two engineers are focused on computer vision and â€˜all the other boring engineeringâ€™ respectively). Youâ€™ll be a pretty big deal at our company. Weâ€™re pretty lucky in that our technology spans everywhere from advanced computer vision to WebGL and HTML5 to Python, PostgreSQL and Redis to low-level run-loop optimizations for UI responsiveness, multithreaded OpenGL, GCD, core data synchronization, etc. It's a lot of fun.Send me an e-mail at ben@bubb.li

      San FranciscoFreedom FreightRails Developer, iOS DeveloperThe last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Freedom Freight is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In a such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has. This means millions of hours are wasted and thousands of drivers are sitting idle or driving empty. We are changing that.We're looking to bring Rails and iOS developers on the team. We're a small, flat company and this is a fantastic opportunity to join a great team trying to conquer one of the largest markets in the US.If you think Freedom Freight would be the perfect fit, send an email with your info to sean@freedomfreightusa.com

      San Francisco, CA. Full time. H1B okay.With 50% of traffic is now driven by social media, and referrer information increasingly useless with mobile clients and HTTPS, traditional web analytics are no longer working. awe.sm is building full-featured social media conversion tracking and analytics.Right now and in the medium term, we're providing immediate value to our customers by giving them firm numbers on the ROI of their social media efforts, in terms of dollars, signups, pageviews or any other metric they pick. Our APIs allow app developers to easily integrate social features into their products and easily present the analyzed data back to their own customers, without having to build their own processing clusters and workflows.Longer term, we want to know what's important on the Internet, and we believe that instrumenting social behaviour is the way to do that.We're looking for back-end engineers who are interested in learning how to handle large volumes of data for aggregation, geo analysis, and graph analysis, in close to real time. Our stack is mostly PHP and Ruby right now (I know, I know) but we believe in simple parts loosely coupled, and also in picking the right tool for the job, so you genuinely have the power to shape the stack you work on.We're also looking for front-end developers to continue to build out our GUI, which is a backbone JS app built on top of the same APIs our customers use.http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernewsWe're 13 people right now. We have a cool new office with awesome views ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) in the heart of the Mission. We have catered lunches, and full health, vision and dental coverage.

      Cambridge, MA (Kendall Square)Software Engineer/Senior Software Engineer at Cogo Labs (http://www.cogolabs.com/)Cogo Labs is a company that creates companies, kind of like an incubator with a twist: all of our ideas/startups come from within the company. We don't offer investment in outside startups. Thus far we have had two major ($100MM+) acquisitions, and a handful of smaller ones, and we are anticipating more in the near future. Typically, once a startup we are incubating gets off the ground, we hire employees into that startup and assist them with whatever they need to make the company successful. Cogo Labs itself has around 40 full-time employees now in our office in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA.I'm looking for a software engineer or senior software engineer to join my team. You should have a degree in CS or a similar field, and experience developing for the web, as most of our startups are web properties. Specific experience in Ruby, Rails, and/or Python are a plus, but not absolutely necessary. I'm more concerned with finding smart people than finding people with specific skills.I am currently developing new features for a web site that we run that gets >50k unique visitors per day, and you'd be assisting in this effort. I can be more specific if you're invited for an interview.We are big on metrics and analysis -- there are grids of monitors (we call them "NOC walls") all over the office showing up-to-the-minute stats about all of our properties. I can code up a new feature, deploy it, and walk over to one of the NOC walls and literally watch my change affect traffic on the site, or revenue, or profit. It's a really fun place to work. Benefits and perks are great as well (see http://cogolabs.com/careers for more info).If you're interested, shoot me an email with your resume and a brief cover letter (be sure to mention you saw this post on HN). Bonus points for including a link to your github page or other code repository where I can see some code you've written.You can reach me at cmatthias at cogolabs.com.
