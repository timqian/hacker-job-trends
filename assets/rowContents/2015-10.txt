Probably the last month I'll post this on one of these threads:I wrote a way to search these recently ... just paste this in your console: https://gist.github.com/kristopolous/19260ae54967c2219da8There is both OR and AND support here. If you specify your function parameter as an ARRAY then it operates as an AND, otherwise each argument is an OR.For instance, to see posts that are remote and python OR remote and ruby, you can doquery(['remote','python'],['remote','ruby']);The return of the function shows how many jobs were shown versus in total. For instance, as of this writing, I get the following result when running the above function:{ shown: 56, total: 827 }It's worth noting that some people have turned this into various "web apps" ... and a few people have forked it and added more sophisticated queries ... search HN news stories for links.
                      
                  
      Alternative: paste the entire page into Vim, then:    qqq:g/remote/exe "norm! ?ago\<cr>\"Qy/ago$\<cr>"

That filters all "remote" postings into @Q. Paste @Q into a new buffer, then you can further filter it e.g. by "python":    qqq:g/python/exe "norm! ?ago\<cr>\"Qy/ago$\<cr>"
                      
                  
      links -dump https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10311580 | vim -will do the trick.
                      
                  
      A link to this gist really should go in the OP by 'whoishiring. It's damn useful.
                      
                  
      Someone from HN actually sent me an email ... looks like it might happen.
                      
                  
      Looks like it did. Congrats.And also, thanks for making this for everyone to enjoy.

That's why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn't some subsidy-dependent industry anymore.

      I interviewed with Theranos a year ago. It seems like one of their front-end teams is very Indian and was only looking to bring in Indians. I asked a very simple question like, "What is the product that your team is working on?" He gave me a curt answer, "We don't build products, we build labs."Uh, okayyy...So, I guess he doesn't understand that labs are the company's products. To twist people's words like that is simply rude and it's not a great team to work with.

This enables unprecedented data analytics: we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time.Our product has been used to grade over 3.5 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students.
