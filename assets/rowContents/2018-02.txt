      Lots of YC companies | Software engineers of all kinds | Everywhere, though mostly in the US | Mostly on-site, but some remote too | Full-time and internA few months ago, a team of us at Y Combinator started working on a "common app", so that people could apply to all Y Combinator companies at the same time.  It seemed silly to us that even though so many companies are struggling to hire people, it still requires O(n) effort to apply to n companies.So, we built workatastartup.com.  It's a simple way to apply to all YC companies at the same time.  It's only for hackers / engineers for now (we hope to open it more broadly later).  If a company is interested, you'll get an email directly from one of the founders.It seems to be working pretty well - many of the people who posted a profile have gotten more than a dozen company founders reaching out to them, and some people have gotten jobs through it already.  We'd love if you filled out a profile and let us know what you think (workatastartup@ycombinator.com) : https://www.workatastartup.com
                      
                  
      > It's only for hackers / engineers for nowI'd say it's even more narrow than that:"Which software engineering roles are you interested in?"Considering that the form doesn't ask much in the way of software- or programming-specific questions, why wouldn't you broaden it to at least all technical roles?
                      
                  
      That's a good point.  We're starting with software just because we want to make sure it works well for a narrow focus before expanding.  I'll be really excited to expand to hardware soon.
                      
                  
      "Which software engineering roles are you interested in?"True, it's hard for me to just pick one. I believe lots of people here can do full-stack + iOS + Machine Learning...
                      
                  
      It's even more narrow than that. I have not created an account, but I am assuming the companies are going to be extremely Bay Area specific. In fact, the form states:"Where do you currently reside? (Some companies help with relocation, but others cannot afford to yet.)"In other words, we don't care where you are, as long as you end up in the Bay Area.

      Southeast USA including: Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), South Carolina (Greenville), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff like valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc/POWER, MIPS, ARMv8/Thumb2/AArch64, x86-64/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.You can email me at users.sf.net, with account name albert.
                      
                  
      > Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax.I really appreciate this nod. Gun rights are a big part of the reason I could never live in the Valley, and though it's a huge part of many people's lives across the country it's not something that you see recognized in recruiting efforts.
                      
                  
      I could never work for a company that felt the need to add mentions about gun rights to their advertisements.  It's fine if you personally support it, but when you bring that attitude into the public face of the company, it's a big red flag about the work environment.
                      
                  
      There are no red flags here. We proudly fly the American flag. One in our cafeteria looks to be about 8x15 feet. Our veterans hold an annual Flag Folding Ceremony in honor of Veteran's Day.Many employees choose to go shooting together, but there is no pressure to participate. It's just a normal all-American activity.I'm not really "the public face of the company". Notice the lack of a trademarked Pantone color. The official corporate identity would tell you nothing about what our office locations are like. They would however proudly tell you about heat beams to zap people and about gun turrets that aim and fire without human action, so they aren't completely boring.
                      
                  
      Uh... I'm sure every paragraph there is a red flag for most peope on HN. I know it is at least for me, and I own guns and was an Eagle Scout.
                      
                  
      My guess is Northrop Grumman. Not sure why it must be so hush hush ;)Proposed merger with Orbital ATK should cement its launch capability into New Space era.Also, Huntsville, AL. Where the James Webb Space Telescope primary manufacturing is performed. Is looking like it may become a budding startup hub.
                      
                  
      Nope, we're a wholly-owned subsidiary (several hundred people) of a vaguely similar company. I could go into the details (better benefits for example) but it gets complicated. People make wrong assumptions about the work environment. We were a start-up about 13 years ago, and still retain much of that culture. It's not a bunch of bureaucrats in cubes wearing ties, and we don't want to waste time interviewing people who seek that kind of thing. There really are lots of useless toxic people who see a famous company name and then picture a bureaucracy in which they can hide as a parasite. We work hard to keep them away.
                      
                  
      My guess is SI based on the information provided.Huntsville is going through its town center/SoDoSoPa phase at the moment with lots of tiny villages and shopping centers being built.  There is a new one going up right by Big Spring Park and it is probably the first time I have seen a crane in downtown.
                      
                  
      Salary range??
                      
                  
      We are hiring at multiple levels and in multiple locations, so it's a big range. You don't want an upper bound on it, do you? That would be limiting. :-)It's possible to beat typical Silicon Valley pay while living out in a cheap place, with a fresh college graduate maybe getting 6 figures after a year or two, but I'm certainly not promising this to you. We seem to be well above the national average. Most people get a large raise after a year or two.To put it another way, I'm feeding a family of 13 (sole provider) and living on a 0.48 acre lot that is less than a mile from the beach. I can walk to work, which is across the street from the beach. With the right technical background, you could do that too.
                      
                  
      Dude, I lived in Austin before and I loved the place! Not looking to move companies anytime soon though as I love my job right now but I'm glad to hear people doing emulators and stuff can be paid big $ too. I've always been interested in emulators/VM/virtualization/OS as I work closer to the metal as they say.
                      
                  
      I'm pretty sure I know what company this is, subsidiary of Raytheon. No one would discuss salary with me until I had an offer and you guys couldn't hit 115K
                      
                  
      You're correct, this is Raytheon -- https://jobs.raytheon.com/location/melbourne-florida-united-...
                      
                  
      We pay some people far more than 115K. Not everybody has the same level of skill.
                      
                  
      Fair enough, I just wish you guys didn't beat around the bush so much about salary in early discussions. I really wanted to take the offer but the salary was a non starter, wasted both of our time.
                      
                  
      A few more things:Interviews aren't perfect. Actually, they are awful, but everything else is worse. An interview is largely what determines the level at which an offer is made. Giving a salary isn't simple when you don't know if a person would be a junior-level person or a senior-level person. Some people interview badly.Even if value is correctly determined, it is important to realize that your value is specific to the job you are being considered for. Picture a world-famous brain surgeon deciding to become a stock trader: it may be that stock traders can be paid well and that the brain surgeon has great skills, but the skills are likely a poor fit for the task at hand. Switching to a different role can make you a beginner again.Most people got large raises in October. If I remember right, 25% was normal. I don't know when you were offered 115K, but that matters. The market finds a price you see. We made the required adjustment.I recently checked starting pay for new college grads at Silicon Valley companies, and 115K seemed to be in the middle of the pack. This is however just the raw number. It's more like 200K if you adjust for cost of living in a place like Florida.
                      
                  
      company details?
                      
                  
      Looks like it's for SourceForge.
                      
                  
      IDK, it sounds like a cyber defense contractor using a sourceforge email for some reason.
                      
                  
      It's an old personal email address, already well-exposed to spammers due to being in the man page for Linux's ps command.
                      
                  
      Oh, that's neat.I'm assuming from the nature of the description that remote work (but still US based) is a hard non-starter?
                      
                  
      We've allowed remote work for well-established and valued employees who need to be remote for personal reasons. For example, we did that for an employee who moved to be close to his cancer-stricken father.We aren't at all likely to hire somebody to be remote on day 1. We consider it to be a security problem.
                      
                  
      That's what I figured.  Thanks for responding.  : )

      All your job applications require that that the applicant must state their salary demands. It seems like you're just data mining for salaries. This is very atypical, most companies wait at least until the interview and would stop me ever applying. I don't really see what you've got to gain by it.
                      
                  
      Well, I think you are mistaken. Including salary range was one addition we came up with recently because,1. We had a couple of candidates who did well in the interview, but finally, when it came to salary negotiation, they were asking much more than what members of the current team were getting. That was justifiable because they had offers from some other countries where developer salaries are better.2. We received better applications because overall we are offering above market rate.But hey, if you would like to keep salary open you may mention that, and I don't think your candidature would be rejected. At least that was what I did when I joined 2 years ago.
                      
                  
      In Germany, it is fairly typical to demand this up-front.However, it's also often OK to apply at these jobs without stating salary demands right away.
                      
                  
      Ah, ok, it could just be a cultural thing that I'm missing. I hadn't seen it on any other German job applications though.

You can see a short talk I gave about one of our older projects here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_h8PElXio8.I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have :)

      Plectica | Onsite or Remote | NYC | Senior Frontend Engineer, Senior Full-StackWe are building a set of tools to enable building and sharing mental models, a more efficient way to organize and share information than traditional tools like written documents and powerpoint presentations. Underpinning this effort is a theory in Systems Thinking called DSRP, the work of our academic partners at Cornell, who have spent the last decade studying how people understand and communicate about complex systems. These tools could be used to map any topic, from historical events, to components of a legal case, to how a combustion engine works, etc. We sometimes think of this as "Google Maps for information".Come help us work through a bunch of fun/hard technical challenges: building interactive data visualizations, facilitating real-time collaboration, large-scale text understanding, searching a distributed knowledge base.Our tech stack includes bespoke JavaScript, SVG, [S]CSS, Riot.js and some off-the-shelf helper libraries for interactive map building and visualization (but in our hearts we're framework agnostic); Redis / Node.js / WebSockets for real-time collaboration; MySQL for a source of truth; and some other tools and services around text-understanding and image processing in Python.We really want to find the right person for this, and will compensate accordingly.Check us out at https://plectica.com, and if you're interested send us a note at jobs@plectica.com, or email me directly (doug at lastofthe.org)

Our team is based in San Francisco and we are well-funded by top investors in the space.Cryptocurrency is a domain where correctness really counts. As such, we focus on building reliable software through the use of statically-typed functional programming languages. This is reflected in our OCaml codebase and style of structuring code around DSLs, as well as in the design of the smart-contracts platform we're developing.There is no need to have prior experience in cryptography, and we're hiring engineers to work on a bunch of exciting projects including:* Our OCaml DSL for writing zk-SNARKs (a cryptographic primitive for certified computation).* The design of a virtual machine and higher-level languages for smart contracts (there a lot of interesting challenges here since the VM has to be efficient inside SNARKs).* Working on the core networking, cryptography, and reliability aspects of the protocol.This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems in computing. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.Please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject "Engineer applicant" to jobs@o1labs.org (I'm the CTO and will read/respond personally.)

      Beware of these folks. When I interviewed (when they posted a remote job here before) they told me after wasting a bunch of time that they aren't actually looking for remote devs. It's not clear why they keep posting remote listings here.They also seem not to be called "Game Closure" anymore. They changed to "Weeby" and then "BlackStorm". Previous discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14485509I'm really curious what they are up to.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the heads up. I too see something fishy going on.
                      
                  
      Be careful when dealing with this company. They have rebranded themselves many times. I have a personal negative experience with them, and seems many others do as well. I interviewed on site, and via Skype. They seem like a decent company on the surface, but in action, appear completely disorganized.I'm really curious about what's really going on there.

      Just to make sure I understand, remote is available only for people who are in the US/have the right to work in the US?
                      
                  
      Hi! Thank you for your question!Due to $reasons, we can only accept applications from folks that currently possess a right to work in the United States (e.g. https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-get-a-permit-to-work-in-th...)
                      
                  
      Thank you for answering. I'm not interested to work in the US at the moment. I just wanted to make sure the restriction exists as I understood it.
                      
                  
      Time waste alert!I spoke to you at length and then your cofounder at length. Then it turns out that you don't actually have any immediate need to fill the role but you "might" have a need in the next 30 to 90 days. I pretty much gathered that you basically subcontract.
                      
                  
      Hi,I'm sorry you felt your time was wasted; we do not aim to do that at any point in the process (it wastes our time, too! :D). We are a kubernetes consulting and DevOps-as-a-Service shop, and some amount of our demand's final materialization is unpredictable. We take pains to mention that in the beginning but, if we didn't, that's on us and I'll make sure we don't miss that again - thank you for bringing that to my attention.I don't know your situation, but it's highly likely we had a significant influx of demand that suddenly softened, and we had to back-off on the hiring. Or, perhaps also likely, we hired someone that more closely matched the position and needed to pause the search (we have 3 people starting on Monday, Feb 5, for example; we've hit our quota of less experienced Kube experts and have re-focused on people with extensive cloud production kube experience).As a profitable but bootstrapped firm that has (yet!) to lay off people due to underwork, we strongly bias against pre-emptive hiring.I wish you the best of luck in your career, and if you are still looking, in your search.--

      >"I don't know your situation, but it's highly likely we had a significant influx of demand that suddenly softened, and we had to back-off on the hiring."Except that I replied in response to a "who's hiring" thread and the interviews followed very close to my responding. So why would you even be posting that you are hiring if you had "demand that suddenly softened"?
                      
                  
      I went through a very lengthy interview process with this company, and made it to the final stage. Had great conversations with everyone at every step and ultimately was turned away with no explanation whatsoever.That being said, a lot of the folks I spoke with seemed pretty sharp. YMMV.
                      
                  
      Hi Michael,Although we strive to hire everyone who reaches the final stages (it's super time consuming for everyone, you and the team!), ultimately we have to turn away people who are awesome but aren't a perfect fit (at our teeny-tiny size back in [time redacted] when you interviewed, we were even pickier than we are now; I wouldn't read too much into our decision to not move forward).We've made a lot of changes in our process since you spoke with us and I hope we're more communicative - to the best of our ability - in our process. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors!--
Matt
                      
                  
      I would not suggest posting specific dates of when candidates were interviewing without a candidate's consent
                      
                  
      I don't think it had anything to do with you. If you notice they always say they're "hiring" on these threads. However they don't necessarily have any new "client" to subcontract out to someone. They don't seem to have any problem wasting people's time though.

Matrixâ€™s mission is to create a universal open network and protocol for real-time communication; liberating users from being trapped in the islands of communication they use today and returning ownership and control of communication back to the people. New Vector builds flagship apps for Matrix such as Riot.im as well as contributing to the core Matrix open source clients, SDKs, servers, bridges and the protocol itself.We believe that the Matrix protocol has the potential to become part of the fabric of the internet, bringing with it a future radically different from the increasingly centralised internet we see today.While New Vector is self sufficient, following a recent funding round [1,2] we are looking to grow the team across the stack. In particular:-* UX/UI Designer to work on Riot web and native apps* Backend Engineers to work on homeserver development as well as bridges, bots, integrations and widgets.* Android Engineers to build out the matrix-android-sdk and Riot.im app* Frontend Engineers to build out the matrix-react-sdk and Riot.im web experience* SREs to support matrix.org and riot.im infrastructure* Cryptography Engineer to move our E2E Encryption out of betaIf you are up for the challenge or just want to know more, either write to us at jobs@matrix.org or reach out to me via matrix IM on @neilisfragile:matrix.orgEven if you are not a perfect match for the above get in touch anyway, weâ€™re always keen to talk to people interested in Matrix.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16258263

      As someone who searches these threads for words like "compiler" to have an overview of what compiler-related jobs are out there, I almost missed this. Others might miss it too, I suggest you add "compilers" and maybe "interpreters" to make it easier to find.

      Time waste alert!I was asked to complete a take home project. I completed and submitted the take home project which took a few hours.I then received nothing more than "canned email rejection." Completely disrespectful.
                      
                  
      thanks for this! We should hold companies to some degree of accountability in interviews.
                      
                  
      I think that you are right, it is great that companies are getting interview reviews on the monthly thread, especially companies that treat candidates poorly. HN is still a relatively small community, so we must all use justifiable words and beware of cognitive biases. For example, I interviewed with the company we are replying to here, and I thought that I was treated fairly. They even looked into bending a hiring policy for me.
                      
                  
      >"HN is a relatively small community, and should use justifiable words, and beware of cognitive biases and unfairly ganging up."Providing feedback is most certainly not "unfairly ganging up" . Common courtesy is just that - a common widely accepted norm.  It's pretty much the antithesis of a personal "cognitive bias."

Looking for developers that are "Smart and Gets Things Done" and also "Done, Gets Things Smart".  (google those terms if you haven't heard them)In a perfect world you would already be well versed in Javascript and front end development (we are using Vue.js as our framework and D3 for visualizations). Rails experience would also be helpful, but intelligence, work ethic and willingness to write tests are all required.Ideal candidate would have a high upper bound on potential and also have aspirations to become a CTO level team member.This will be a salary + equity position.  Full-time employee only.  Must be based in the United States.  Remote is allowed. Preference will be given to candidates local to Austin, TX, but only if everything else appears equal.  Skill is the ultimate arbiter.Please email me at harris at nimblelabs.com and let me know what you scored on the math portion of the SAT/ACT and provide any relevant links to corroborate your skillset.
                      
                  
      You're a software consulting agency and you care about SAT/ACT math scores? Very polarizing ask, glad you mentioned it here.
                      
                  
      For interested parties, from the overly lengthy "Done, Gets things smart post" referenced:> Not the Smart, and Gets Things Done, Just As Soon As I Read Up On The Subject, On The Company's Dime> Not superstars: superheroes! People who are freakishly good at what they do. People who finish things so fast that they seem to have paranormal assistance. People who can take in any new system or design for all intents instantaneously, with no "ramp-up", and who can immediately bring insights to bear that are quite simply beyond your rustic abilities.I'll leave it to applicant judgement if this is the sort of place they want to work.
                      
                  
      Yep, I'm looking for a new role just now, and these sorts of euphemisms are a complete turn off.
                      
                  
      Thank you guys for the comments.  I am going to re-word this next time.  While I like the general idea of "Done, gets things smart", some of the content of that post is describing a top 0.1% type person and is over the top for a general job posting.I know I am not a top 0.1% programmer and while I am solid and want to hire people smarter than me the full scope of that piece is extreme.Nonetheless I make no apologies for wanting to hire very smart people.  If a software company's ability to execute is a function of the collective intelligence of the team, it is critical to have smart people.All the best guys!
