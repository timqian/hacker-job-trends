Millions of farmers globally don't have access to the basic farm tools the rest of the world depends on for food production, good seed and fertilizer. We sell these proven agricultural tools on credit, and use satellite data and ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably.We use Scala, Python/NumPy/SciPy (for science/ML), android and are heavy postgres users. We're building great software for places with low reliability networks and harsh environmental conditions.We  delivered fertilizer to ~1000 farmers earlier this March and are now in the process of getting paid back and supporting our farmers this season.

      Hey Evan! We use Figma to produce a lot of the images in the CertSimple blog - we moved to Windows and needed something that could open our old .sketch files properly and started using it for new content.Some feedback: I understand it's a web app, but the download/native versions can be really confusing. Like I can't click on a .sketch file to open/import it to Figma, and I have to remember to 'import' files rather than 'open' them (maybe 'open and import' to communicate you're uploading them?).PS. I'd love it if you collaborated with the Invision people too.
                      
                  
      After reading your blog posts I'm wondering why you didn't write a standalone app. It sounds like you're making your life more complicated by doing that in the browser.You're doing it this way so you don't have to redevelop parts of the app for each platform ? But then you have to worry about cross browser compatibility.Anyway what you're doing is very interesting and I wish you good luck !
                      
                  
      Edit: should have read the product presentation before commenting. They explain why they decided to develop a web app and it makes sense.
                      
                  
      Figma is awesome. Joining them would be a great idea.
                      
                  
      That tool looks really, really great. Vector networks.

      BBC iPlayer | Development Lead | London, UK | Onsite | Full Timehttp://careerssearch.bbc.co.uk/jobs/job/Development-Lead-iPl...The job description is pretty much on point - we're a small team of 4 engineers (one of whom is me). We build the API for iPlayer (the video one, not the radio one), which is used by the Mobile Apps, TV Apps, Website and syndication partners such as Sky & Virgin - last week we counted 1 billion requests.
We're also looking after the Apple TV app (TVML), some open source programs and a number of internal tools for our editorial staff.At the moment we're extending our personalisation capabilities with some audience research and exciting ML projects and would love someone to help us build the best VoD & live content platform to come out of the UK.PS: Because I'm not a fan of how we advertise salaries, I'm going to point out this FOI request which shows last year's salary bands for "G9". It's gone up a bit since: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/360583/response/87566...
                      
                  
      Is remote 100% out of the question?
                      
                  
      100% remote is out of the question I think..Most of us WFH 1-3 days a fortnight, but I doubt there's much more scope. Would have to be discussed with the engineering manager.
                      
                  
      There's only four of you? How much time did you have to waste on the TV License check stuff? :(
                      
                  
      At the moment, the user activity data that goes through our API at no point has anything to do with checking licences.We do add a 'requiresTvLicence': true to non-partner programmes (i.e. BBC programmes which are funded by the licence fee), but the clients are responsible for making sure the user has confirmed that they "have a TV Licence" before playing.
                      
                  
      this looks incredible low for a lead in london, even with 'up a bit'
                      
                  
      I took a 25% pay cut when taking a job at the BBC about 14yrs ago. It was worth it.
                      
                  
      What made it worth it?
                      
                  
      Not really tech talent is paid much less in London than SVEngineers are seen as a lot lower status :-(Unfortunately the BBC's FS Pension is now closed
                      
                  
      I'd disagree with that.Leads I know at several major London companies are in the 70-90k range.Pre-brexit exchange rates put that salary not too far off SF, plus lower living costs than the bay ($3000 for a one bed? No thanks).Hell, I don't know many contractors on less than 100k (once you do the math).
                      
                  
      Don't think housing is cheaper in London than SV - its just public transport is better allowing for a longer distance commuteInteresting but a contractor on 100k is only equivalent to circa 45k as a FTE using the 3x rule I would expect a contractor rate for a FTE of 80k to be in the 200k range.Also do they offer the same value in share options /rsu's etc. that SV companies do
                      
                  
      That's not how the 3x rule works. You don't use the 3x rule to compare yearly compensation.
                      
                  
      Note that all of this is UK based.Startups in London will offer shares for senior positions in much the same way as San Fran, normally with a vestment period, but it's not as common.I'm not 100% on what the 3x rule is.What I do know is that most of my contractor friends are on around Â£500 per day, which assuming a 260-workday year is 130k. There's a couple of oracle DBA's on around 800pd, which is 208k.But then you have to administer a database & there's only so much I'd be prepared to do for money.As a contractor, normal tax rules don't apply (and are normally much more beneficial). So a contractor earning 90k & a FTE earning 90k still results in the contractor coming out miles ahead in terms of raw income.Obviously there's offsets to this. No sick pay, no paid leave, no free pension contributions etc.
                      
                  
      A typical year would more likely be 220-230 workdays a year, maybe less if you have gaps between short term contracts.Also, the dividend tax has closed the gap a bit, along with the flat rate scheme being effectively killed.
                      
                  
      The rule of thumb I was told for contractors is you calculate your day rate by multiplying your FTE rate by 3Though you have to watch for IR35 a lot of contractors would fail ir35 and be stuck with a huge tax bill
                      
                  
      In my experience so far and what I was told was bank on 1000hrs worked in a year.. figure out how much you want to make in that many hours. You need to triple your FTE salary because insurance, taxes, and savings(401k)). For me that comes to about $105-125 an hour.My experience is that your price is set by how much work you want. When I first started I had a really low rate, and I complained to a much more seasoned freelancer that I had to much work.. and he responded with something that seems so obvious now, but at the time I didn't even think this way. He told me, "If you have to much work, you aren't charging enough." So over the next 3 or so months I kept raising my rates until I found a happy medium between the # of clients I have and how much I'm bringing in.My work has benefited from it because I'm not having to work 50hr weeks to make the same amount of money. The hours my clients are getting are much higher quality, and my work life balance is sane.
                      
                  
      in the US in my first year, full time contracting I did 130k on right at 1200 hours worked.I'm on pace to do the same this year working mostly 20-30hr weeks. The rest of the time I'm spending working on my own projects and hopefully generating some recurring revenue.Not looking to be the next big thing. I'm completely ok with a "lifestyle" business as people call it in SV.I did this from my remote bunker nestled in the mountains of Vermont and am completely satisfied with that.
                      
                  
      did you know that boring FST100 companies like BT offer shares to all staff? if you had maxed out a share save scheme a few years ago you would have made over 150k tax free?
                      
                  
      I do. As a guy contracting for a FTSE 100 company now who've just had a buyout offer from the states, I'm surrounded by a bunch of execs that are incredibly happy (assuming it comes off)

We create all hardware, software and IT-Infrastructure to run our systems on our own. Beside access systems we are already putting a lot of R&D effort in creating further new smart home/building automation products. We see ourselves as an engineering-driven technology company, that influences how a future with connected devices will look.We enable engineers to focus on what they can to best, letting them work on new products in small, highly interdisciplinary teams. We try to get rid of as much management overhead as possible (no daily standup meetings!).Right now, we are hiring new engineers for the following areas:- (Frontend) Web Developer- RUST Backend Developer (our backend is 100% rust!)- Electrical EngineerWe do not care about your academic degrees or where you are from, but about the stuff you did and what you could create in the future given the right opportunities. If you are interested in working at 1aim, write us an email at work.hn<?>1aim.com and tell us about the projects you worked on that you are the most proud of and which technological feats of the past inspire you.

      Man, I wish I had more experience with Rust.
This looks really nice!Any chance you guys have a blog or something, talking about the experience of using Rust as a backend language?
                      
                  
      Not yet (we're working on it)! But it has been an absolute joy to work with rust so far. We haven't had a single crash in production since we started using it and the zero-cost, high level abstractions allow you to write nice, safe APIs with very little code. All that while providing stellar performance and still being able to write low level code when necessary. The ecosystem is still growing and sometimes you have to put in a little more work to get certain functionality that is well supported in other languages because the library/crate for that does not exist yet or is in an early stage of development. Rust also has an amazing community.We are long-time sponsors of rustfest, so If you are in europe this could be a good opportunity to get to know some of the team members and ask questions.
                      
                  
      Dataquest | Data Science Instructor | San Francisco | Remote okay | $90k-$120k + equityAt Dataquest (www.dataquest.io), we teach data science and data engineering to thousands of students around the world every day. We teach the concepts behind the code, then help students build projects until everything clicks. We think about online learning in a vertically integrated way, from the actual learning content and the product all the way to job preparation. Students with no programming and just high school math backgrounds have gone from 0 to job ready and have gotten jobs at companies like SpaceX, and our NPS is around 60.We don't believe in skimming the surface of concepts so that students just know what to type. We build intuition around complicated ideas like random forests from the ground up. We walk students through building their own algorithms, so we can help them understand the tradeoffs and limitations of techniques. We help students build projects, so they can solidify their knowledge and get real-world experience.While so far we've mostly focused on teaching data science through Python, we're looking for someone to help us extend and enhance our R content. This involves writing instructional content, creating projects, thinking about how to improve how we teach, mentoring students directly, and getting feedback from students to improve our teaching methods. If you have:- experience writing R code (whether on the job or your own packages)- experience writing technical data science content- a strong a data science foundation- a deep interest in teachingWe're looking for someone who shares our mission of giving people access to high quality education at a low cost. You'll have a lot of latitude to shape how we teach, and to help build a personalized educational platform. We're bootstrapped and profitable, so this is also a chance to learn more about the business side.If this is interesting, please email srini at dataquest.io.

      Hi, not even sure if I should reply to this, but I just thought maybe some advice anonymously would be the right thing to ask for. Codex, sounds like exactly the kind of company I'd like to work for. A small team working on important possibly life changing technology using new technology and in biology no less Which is probably the thing the that fascinates me most after CS even if I'm not as knowledgeable there. The fact you're using a lot of Python and ES6 React definitely helps too.My problem is I don't feel like I have the skills you'd be looking for now. I graduated this spring with a CS degree from a no name state school. I came out near the top of my class (honestly I might be the top of CS), but I lack experience. I'm just now taking my first internship and while valuable I don't feel like I'm really learning much, I'm the one trying to teach my coworkers what GIT and why it has advantages over RCS, or more worrying how to use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.My plan right now, tentative as it is, is to get an additional undergraduate in biotechnology from my university. As I mentioned Biology has always fascinated and I'm at a time in my life where I have both the time and the opportunity to do this without incurring debt, but I'm devoured by doubt. The kind of job I want is almost all in the startup world and they tend not to take a ton of interns. At the same time by specializing I make myself less attractive to other companies that might otherwise take me on as an intern.I'm open to any opinion, commentary, or advice, but specifically is this a viable path. What would I need to be good candidate for Codex (or frankly it's like) upon graduation?
                      
                  
      The listing says nothing about needing to know biology...
                      
                  
      Well there were two reasons. I've always have been fascinated by biology, and while not primary, this and just about every other bio company I've seen lists it as a bonus.
This one says: "You have a passion for (or are interested in learning about) biology!"Second though and this is part of why I'm second guessing it acts as a delaying tactic a bit. I started college 2 years early (less impressive when you realize I'm old for my grade and homeschooled), and I wasn't really thinking about career enough then. I feel like were I to graduate now I'd be on a trajectory that would never see my career developing into what I want.But honestly you bring up a good point. Would I be better off going into the workplace and gaining some experience?
                      
                  
      Yes, work experience is way better than another degree. And sure, they have "nice to have" bio experience. But work at a bio-related company for two years, and now you have bio experience... and a real sense of what you really need to know. And maybe then you'll go back to school, or maybe you'll realize you don't need to.
                      
                  
      Sorry for the very late reply. My worry is that the type of companies I'd like to work for don't really seem inclined to take me right now.
                      
                  
      I used to co-work out of the same office as One Codex, and these folks are the real deal: Thinking through hard, novel problems on the whiteboard, programming on their own as well as in pairs, all while maintaining a super collegial atmosphere. As someone who was a fly on the wall during some of their earlier days, I can't recommend them highly enough!

Thankfully, you have billions of data points to help you.â€¢ Recommender systems: A standard SVD works well. But what happens when you have to choose the top products amongst hundreds of thousands for every user, 2 billion times per day, in less than 50ms?â€¢ Auction theory: In a second-price auction, the theoretical optimal is to bid the expected value. But what happens when you run 15 billion auctions per day against the same competitors?â€¢ Explore/exploit: It's easy, UCB and Thomson sampling have low regret. But what happens when new products come and go and when each ad displayed changes the reward of each arm?â€¢ Offline testing: You can always compute the classification error on model predicting the probability of a click. But is this really related to the online performance of a new model?â€¢ Optimization: Stochastic gradient descent is great when you have lots of data. But what do you do when all data are not equal and you must distribute the learning over several hundred nodes?Missions of the team in more details: http://labs.criteo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Software-E...Feel free to drop us a line at rndrecruitment[@]criteo.com =)

While, Manifold allows you to build and offer cloud services to developers without having to worry about billing, identity, and credential distribution (An example of one such service: JawsDB).Weâ€™re a small, remote-friendly venture-backed company based in Halifax, Canada with teams in Toronto and San Francisco. With a shared passion for making developers lives easier and our backgrounds reflect that, having worked at the likes of Red Hat, Heroku, and Salesforce.Apply for the Backend / API Engineer at https://jobs.alongside.com/details/backend--api-engineer/160...Apply for CLI and Integrations Engineer at https://jobs.alongside.com/details/cli-and-integrations-engi...

Come work on digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum every day!About us:* We use React, Mobx, Flow, webpack, and styled-components on the frontend.* Our APIs are currently powered by Rails with a MongoDB backend, but we're investing heavily in decomposing the monolith into services written in statically typed languages.* We're exploring GraphQL for future APIs and are hiring two people to lead our APIs team.If you're interested, email me at jpollak@coinbase.com.
                      
                  
      A bit OT, but of the trading sites I use coinbase is the buggiest and most frustrating - despite obvious (but misplaced) efforts to be more consumer friendly. Please hire a product manager to clean up the experience! It's clear nobody has taken ownership.

      which statically typed languages? You know Python has/will support even more static typing, which will be interesting...

      I believe that's the case at this time. However, we do have many remote employees, and it's likely that we'll list other remote positions in the future. Also, I can't give specifics or make promises as I am not involved in hiring, but there might be a possibility that remote would be allowed for the right candidate, even on a position that isn't listed as such. I don't think there would be any harm in applying for a position not explicitly listed as remote.
                      
                  
      How do you feel about SuiteCRM?
                      
                  
      So, I don't want to just dodge the question, but I'm neither part of the legal nor marketing teams, and as such, I suspect I'm not cleared to talk about this in public. I doubt there's a way for me to respond to this that will satisfy both you, and the marketing and legal departments. Willing to call it a draw?
                      
                  
      Sure thing. For what it's worth we use it at my work, and I think it's awful code quality and bug wise.

      Unrelated to the job posting. Your software sounded interesting and I wanted to check it out, but it doesn't let me sign up with a gmail account. That seems pretty restrictive. You should let trial accounts use a personal address so they don't have to commit with a work address that has more rules around what can be used (or if they are just starting out what might be their work address).
