We are located in Mountain View.  
http://matterport.com/jobs/
email us at jobs@matterport.comSoftware Engineer (Computer Vision & Algorithms focus):Youâ€™ll be working on our 3D alignment and mesh reconstruction algorithms, improving robustness and quality.  Youâ€™ll need to get creative and invent new algorithms, not just apply known techniques.  There are still big, interesting problems to solve that are central to our product.Unlike much of computer science, computer vision is about messy data and uncertain results, so youâ€™ll need to work well with that.  Past experience in computer vision or a related field such as machine learning is preferable.  Experience with high-performance code (optimization, parallelization, CUDA) is a plus.  Our codebase is primarily in C++.

      Hi, you might have heard of the company I work for, Yammer. We were in the news recently, and we're looking to hire in San Francisco.We've got a variety of positions open, but since this is Hacker News, I'll tell you about our engineering team. Every single engineer here is the type of person that can be honest with themselves and others. We like to use tools and technologies because they allow us to build things our customers want, not because we think the tools are cool.Some tools we use: Java. Scala. Ruby, and Rails, Javascript, Node.js, Objective-C, and C#. We like to store things in Postgres, Riak, Vertica, and our super-awesome custom-built distributed feeds DB written on top of BDB JE-HA.If you're the type of engineer who believes in the One True Language To Rule Them All, we're not interested. If you're the type of engineer who doesn't understand how users think, we're not interested. Yammer has a high bar, and we're not willing to compromise on that. If you're confident in your abilities, and you think you can help use take over and change corporate America, let's talk.Yammer is the type of place where you can use whatever resources you can muster to actually change the world. Yammer is used by many many large corporations, with real impact. We have customers inside the valley, outside the valley, and all around the world. We're used by a vast majority of companies in the Fortune 500. We have customers with 10 employees, 100 employees, and 100,000 employees. Or more. We allow those employees to all talk to each other, stay connected with their company, and do their job vastly more efficiently. Our customers stop sending email. Our customers communicate outside their departments, and low-level employees can have frank and honest conversations about their work with C-level executives. A Yammer company is quite different than your average company.Our product is kinda like Facebook, and kinda like Twitter, sure. We're inspired by the best, and we won't hesitate to steal good ideas. But any change we make to our product is tested thoroughly and analyzed intelligently. We like the scientific method. We're not messing around. If you'd like to join a serious team of hard-working and effective engineers with their hearts set on changing how the modern corporation communicates, get in touch.Yammer pays competitively. Yammer offers all the standard perks. Yammer is no longer allowed to host events in certain SOMA drinking establishments.If you have questions, send me an email: bkudria@yammer-inc.com
                      
                  
      I use the product. It's a great product; I'd roll the dice and say there's a pretty great team behind it.
                      
                  
      This is a well written comment. The organization you described sounds really interesting. One change I've always wanted to see in Corporate America is transparent pricing. I just visited your website and there's a "contact sales" button. Is that something you guys are working on?
                      
                  
      You had me at "Yammer is no longer allowed to host events in certain SOMA drinking establishments."
                      
                  
      You should really have a Team page

      ThousandEyes (www.thousandeyes.com), San Francisco, Sequoia backedINTERN, FULL-TIME, H1B, GREENCARDThousandEyes is an early-stage startup in the application performance management (APM) space backed by Sequoia Capital and with offices in San Francisco.The commoditization of the Internet is changing not only the way the applications are delivered, but also the way applications are architected, with the increasing use of cloud services,  SaaS and virtualization. This trend results in loss of control and visibility causing existing solutions to be inadequate and presents new challenges in application performance management for organizations.At ThousandEyes, we believe that one does not have to sacrifice visibility and control when adopting distributed architectures and cloud services. To this end we are building a novel platform that truly understands the infrastructure layer underneath complex distributed applications as well as the end to end application delivery. Our core technology is a combination of active probing by exploiting protocols to extract critical data as well as passive techniques such as capturing traffic to infer network and application metrics. We are a team of radical thinkers and hackers and our core principle is to out innovate our competitors. We are actively looking for like minded people who enjoy hacking protocols and are passionate about disrupting the performance management space through our next generation platform.Open positions:
* Frontend Software Engineer
* Java Software Engineer (Full Stack)
* C/C++ Systems Software EngineerFull details at http://www.thousandeyes.com/company/careersTo apply please send your cv to jobs@thousandeyes.com together with a paragraph explaining what you can bring to ThousandEyes and a code sample if possible.

We use a combination of machine vision (OpenCV + our own algorithms) on standard video cameras, and other inputs like RFID/WiFi data to build a complete picture of what's happening inside a physical retail store.

We are fundamentally changing the way retail stores are designed and operated.We use C/C++, Java, Python and Flex. Our product runs on Linux.

      Well, we have no specific projects for which we're waiting for interns. We'd like to get some smart interns for a while and see what you can do in whatever interests you, and see if it makes sense (from both sides) to maybe turn this into a full-time thing. Send us a note at jobs@bvinetworks.com and let's chat.

      Ha!  That was my first thought as well.  Google tells me that Salesforce bought it from Microsoft.  One can only hope MS was a bit hard up that month, and thus susceptible to some hard bargaining?There are so many domain names of new companies that instantly cast an image in my head of a handful of people sitting around a conference table, shaking their heads and subtly grimacing but still mustering up optimism about the compromises they're making with a domain name.well, it sure is quirky, but that'll capture their imaginations, right?  the walrus evokes a kind of avuncular humor, as well as a kind of powerful muscularity, both of which are very appealing across many demographicswell, launching with the dot net is a bit risky, but we're an internet underpinnings kind of company right?  That's what dot net is for, I believe, and anyone who goes to the dot com will realize they're in the wrong place pretty quicklywell, sure, we'd have to spell it out letter-by-letter in a radio interview, but who does radio anymore?  in a conversation, you'll just give them your card.  and in google, once we've got some traction any of the natural misspellings are going to work just fine anyway.  the sound of it is just awesome, the three Xs make for a powerful text logo, and the dot com isn't squatted or anythingoh, but come on, who's going to read it like that?  someone with a sick mind, that's who, but even then, doesn't that just add a little spark of interest to an industry that otherwise has a pretty boring imagewell, it sure is a boatload of cash, and we could probably launch 5 startups with just the funds that are going into this domain name, but we've got the resources right now, and if this thing really takes off that'll be a drop in the bucket, right?  Really, really takes off, yeah, but i've been crunching the numbers and

      San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.Academia.edu has over 800,000 registered users, and over 3 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics have tripled this year. Over 2,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.We need talented engineers to come and help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that there is a chance to make a big impact.We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We have a strong engineering culture. We're a 6 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:â˜… building new features (a conference feature, a discussion feature for papers)â˜… enhancing existing features (News Feed, Profile page, paper upload tools)â˜… building back-end infrastructure to scale the siteWhat we're looking for are:â˜€ 2+ years of web development experienceâ˜€ Experience with the full engineering stackâ˜€ Passion for engineeringAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them.

      Bay Area (Burlingame): mid-level engineer. Our product is a highly configurable LAMP web application in the high-volume event management space. It's an end-to-end solution, from registration to check-in to reporting. There are also modules for exhibitor registration, session management, housing, and air travel.Our technologies include the Zend Framework, Git, Jira, Hudson, and a highly-available MySQL replication solution.Â We use agile methodologies to support the product in two monthly maintenance releases, tightly paired to a sprint. If you're familiar with "A Successful Git Branching Model", you have a solid idea of how we pair sprints to releases. Our team is distributed between California and Virginia.Some unusual selling points for our business:
* Engineers spend roughly 10% of their total time traveling in support of events using the software. It's a fun opportunity to see new places, learn new things (we do a lot of major technology conferences), and get a lot of cool conference freebies.* The business is not a startup; it's a small business. You can generally expect to go home on time every day. There is no "sweat equity" -- you get paid a fair market value for your time.* We are on the federal holiday schedule. This generally allots a few more days off than your usual small business/startup.* The product is currently fairly stable for the majority of its use cases. You'll have a lot of opportunity to work on enhancements and new features as you become more familiar with how it works.* While we have a daily scrum meeting, we hold it in IRC. That means you have one less meeting to distract you from what you're doing every day, since you can work in parallel.Feel free to check out http://www.aetherquest.com/ to learn more about our company. If you're interested in applying or just have any questions, feel free to email me at relwell@ the domain above.

      San Francisco, CAPagerDuty - http://www.pagerduty.comFULLTIME, INTERN* Software Engineers: (http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/engineering/software-engineer)* Front-end Engineers (http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/engineering/frontend-engineer)* Software Engineering InternWhat we do:At PagerDuty, we're building an alerting and incident tracking system that helps IT operations groups detect and respond to high-severity issues.You know how there are thousands of monitoring systems out there? We don't do monitoring. Instead, we plug into all of the existing monitoring systems and handle the people part of the equation: alerting (via phone, SMS, email), on-call scheduling for teams, auto-escalation of critical alerts, and incident tracking.Our current product helps IT ops people know about critical problems as quickly as possible, collaborate as a team to fix problems quickly, and help track and improve incident response performance over time. Our vision is to expand into the event management space. This means treating data from monitoring tools as events and intelligently filtering and correlating events across monitoring tools in order to reduce the noise. It's like spam filtering for events: a critical problem, such as a bad deploy, will automatically alert the entire team via phone call, while a minor issue like a server going down in a fleet of 20 will only generate a low-priority email alert.Why you should work with us:We are different than many startups out there: we charge money for a product. Companies love our product; that's a lot to say for a system that frequently wakes our users up in the middle of the night. Our revenue is growing steadily at more than 10% month-over-month since we launched in Jan 2010. Our customers include: Netflix, National Instruments, VMWare, NBC Universal, Square, Heroku, and 37 signals. We're also fairly early stage (11 people, pre-series A). This combination means you'll get a market-rate salary plus a decent chunk of stock in a company that has already figured out its business model.We have very interesting technical challenges. Our biggest challenge is engineering a system that never ever goes down. Since our customers rely on us to deliver their critical alerts, we are not allowed to go down ever. This means we've had to engineer a distributed system across multiple data centers that can survive a single data-center outage without skipping a beat. We're not done: we have a lot more work to do to ensure our system reaches the level of telephony reliability (five-nines). If you like engineering distributed fault-tolerant systems, join us.To apply, please send your resume to jobs@pagerduty.com.

      Braintree - Chicago, ILWe're seeking exceptional developers.If this job isnâ€™t right for you, weâ€™ll pay you $5,000 if you refer someone who is hired! Have them contact us or send us their contact information and we will do all of the leg work.*We are growing our development team. Instead of including a list of requirements we want you to understand how we work. If our environment sounds like a place for you, then go to our â€˜How to Applyâ€™ section and follow the instructions.How we workWe pair...We pair program to write all of our software. We work on Mac Pros with two keyboards and two monitors. We work in an open team room; no cubicles or private offices. Communication is key to our process, and we don't want to hinder it with walls.We test...Testing is at the forefront of our development philosophy. We never need to check our code coverage to know that it's at 100%: with disciplined TDD, no line of code will be written without a test. We don't have a QA team. That might be terrifying when you consider the type of software that we're building, but we're confident that our automated testing is thorough and will catch any regression bugs. We use continuous integration to test every version of every client library against our gateway.We are agile...Agile development methodologies mean different things to different people. For us, the most important part of Agile is doing what works best for the team. We have a story card wall and release a few times a week. We keep the team in sync with daily standups and have a retrospective once a month to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements. Weâ€™re pragmatic, not dogmatic. Although we have strong opinions, we're never afraid to try to new things to see if they work and reconsider our positions if the situation warrants it.We are polyglots...Although most of our software is written in Ruby, we donâ€™t confine ourselves to a single programming language. We believe in using the best tool for the job while maintaining a slight bias toward the tools the team knows the best. Weâ€™ve written infrastructure components in Python, and we build client libraries for integrating with Braintree in Ruby, Python, Node.js, PHP, Java, and .NET.We value our people...We spend a whole day every two weeks working on whatever weâ€™re interested in, regardless of whether it's relevant to the business. Some examples of the things people have chosen to work on include competing against each other to build a mesh chat client in node.js, contributing to open source projects, and discussing strategies for our Google AI challenge submissions.Salaries are generous and compensation packages include 401k contributions, and ample vacation time.Interested?We're looking for people who are interested in getting in on the ground floor of an incredible opportunity to build amazing software and transform the payments industry.Take a look at some of our blog posts to see some of the problems we face:
http://www.braintreepayments.com/inside-braintree/how-we-bui...Take a look at some of the code we have on github: https://gihub.com/braintreeThink youâ€™ve got something to contribute to our exceptional team? Weâ€™d like to hear from you!NOTE: The referrer will receive this bonus only after the candidate is employed at Braintree for at least 60 days after his or her start date. The referrer must also complete and return a w-9 in order to receive the bonus. The referrer is responsible for paying taxes on the referral bonus. Also, to qualify for the referral bonus, the hired candidate must have accepted our offer of employment within two months of your referral.

      Los Angeles, CA. Full time.Software Engineer at ThinkNearThinkNear is an early stage start-up building solutions for location-aware mobile devices that are going to redefine how advertising works. One of our co-founders was a top-coder at Amazon, where he built a next generation customer targeting engine for Amazonâ€™s credit card program, grew a highly-available payment service from 0-1< million requests per hour, and then owned third party order management handling $10 billion annually.  The other has a top tier business background â€“ experience building startups, formerly at Amazon, Harvard MBA, etc.  Weâ€™re funded by top tier VCs.  We have an alpha level product, but need to grow it into a true beta that can scale with the businesses massive growth.We have built an incredible team of overachievers facing hard technical challenges and creating massive opportunity. Weâ€™re always looking for ambitious, driven self-starters who want to be on the leading edge of developing technology.Check out our video at www.thinknear.com.Role:We are looking for a top tier software engineer or chronically under-recognized hacker. Along the top of your resume, you could list 30-odd acronyms from SQL to XML and back through the JVM a dozen times, but hate the idea that thatâ€™s what companies will evaluate you on. You donâ€™t code, you craft. Your solutions are as elegant as they are simple. You love getting that perfect solution that takes only 4 lines of code instead of an ungodly 6.  At the same time, you can self-manage. When a critical deadline looms you can power through and deliver a reliable solution. You are the go-to guy (or girl) on whatever team you work.Our ideal candidate will be ready to jump into an intense and high-growth start-up environment. You have experience building real products in the real world. Weâ€™re generally very focused on raw smarts and experience building awesome stuff.  However, sometimes you just really need in-house expertise. You are our leader when it comes to Gems, Ruby, and Rails. Technically when most people rank themselves from 1-10 on a language, they overestimate by at least 2-5 points -- you are legitimately an 8-9 in Ruby, preferably on Rails.  We are looking for someone capable of owning the whole stack of a project, from HTML/CSS/JQuery through to the database.Final note: this job posting is for one of the first few engineers. Youâ€™ll be in a position to shape the direction of the code, the team, the product, and the company. Weâ€™re looking for people who are excited by that.Responsibilities:â˜… Design and code new features and enhancements across all our product offerings
â˜… Participate in all aspects of a project life-cycle, from specifications through QA
â˜… Collaborate on finding and fixing bugs and scalability/optimization issuesRequirements:BS or MS in Computer Science or related field preferred

      Santa Clara, CA
Progressive Solutions (www.printhq.com and www.frecklebox.com)FULLTIME Software EngineerWe are solving hard problems in the worlds of manufacturing, e-commerce, and mass customization. Can you help? We need an on-site programmer (no telecommute) in Santa Clara, CA to work closely with our executive and customer service teams. Initial responsibilities would include supporting internal customers of our technology and helping partners integrate with our online ordering system. You'd report to the director of engineering (that's me!) and be employee #3 in our development group.We are a fun and fast-moving company. We rely heavily on a mix of open source software and applications built on Microsoft's .Net platform, so if you enjoy integrating systems there will be lots of fun opportunities for you. Although we are a small company, we've got big ideas, and you'd get to be involved in some big projects like transforming our production workflow, implementing automated continuous testing, and transitioning to Agile development methodologies.Initial projects you'd be working on include:
* Assist customers in the use of our XML-based online ordering gateway- add new features, automate testing, update documentation, and troubleshoot
* Develop extensions to our online document customization engine and e-commerce systems (C#, SQL Server)
* Troubleshoot and improve our production management scripts (Python, Perl, MySQL)What we're looking for:
* Experience developing web applications with an object-oriented compiled language such as C# or Java and a framework such as ASP.Net or one of the Java frameworks (Struts, etc.). A little preference is given to people who already know Visual Studio, C#, etc. but good general coding skills are way more important to us than knowledge of a particular toolset.* Experience with an interpreted scripting language such as Python, Ruby, or Perl* Patience and excellent communication skills. You will often be in a troubleshooting role, and you will be helping stressed-out people who just want the software to work already.Our company is growing fast, and the small size of our engineering team means you will get a lot of input as we grow. 10% time means you'll have a chance to work on personal projects that benefit the company or do the refactoring that's been bugging you for weeks. This is a great opportunity for someone who is looking to join a team that is run like a start-up without the long hours and risk. Benefits include health care and participation in our company-wide Ownership Thinking profit sharing plan.Check out our websites at printhq.com and frecklebox.com, and send resumes and cover letters to jobs@printhq.com. If you've got a github profile with public repositories or some cool scripts on gist, you'll be on the top of our stack.
