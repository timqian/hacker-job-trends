      >> "Bottom line â€“ we build spaceships and explore asteroids. If you need any other motivation to apply, donâ€™t bother."Interesting message. Does that mean they only want crazy  space nuts?  And don't want regular engineers, who are in business of building things for money?
                      
                  
      Basically that's the idea. If you don't have the passion, just the skill... you are not welcomed there. Makes sense, it's a small niche, I'm sure they find people easily.

      Weft - http://weft.io - Boston MA. INTERN or REMOTE are both welcome!  ===========================
  ====== What we do =========
  ===========================
We're Waze for Cargo. Building hardware to put inside of shipping containers so our customers get realtime visibility into their supply chain. We're then taking the info we get from the hardware and figuring out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predicting whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically rerouting/rescheduling shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff.  ===========================
  ===== How we do it ========
  ===========================
Web stack -> clojure (immutant) + HANA (really scary database on crack) -- we use middleman + enlive (and a bit of hiccup) for templatingAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)Hardware -> prototyped with arduino, still using atmel uC but no longer arduino-ey. Manufacture-ready. In the process of sourcing for large scale manufacturing. Have some pilots running.  ===========================
  ====== And the rest =======
  ===========================
We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies).Looking for help at every point in the system (hardware, firmware, frontend, backend, algorithms, mobile, etc).
If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!
                      
                  
      Marc,
With about 35 years of moving stuff around for a living (from bike messenger to air cargo and all in-between) I can resonate with Weft. Had it existed years ago I would have fewer white hairs. While I have a day job arranging financing for railroad projects (strategicrail.com), I'd love to explore helping you with business development.

We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support.

We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook, and have as flat a structure as we can.We're looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.We're also looking for engineers for sales and marketing positions.

[LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]We're a YC company wrangling SaaS to work together (as they should), starting by bringing the biggest apps our customers use right into Gmail. We've been growing our team over the past few months, and looking to add even more awesome people. We work with dozens of API's to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw available when helping customers.Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there's still so much polish and improvement possible.We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we've recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it's interesting.Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers. We're building a team that's able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.This is both UI and backend work.Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript. sean @ zenboxapp https://www.zenboxapp.com

      San FranciscoIntransRuby Engineers, AndroidThe last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.
We are changing that. We use our location-based technology to automatically match supply and demand.If you're ready to transform the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to jobs@intrans.com.

      The Social Gaming Company / London / Full-time / Python / Team LeaderThis is a great opportunity to work with a team that are using interesting technology to work on interesting problems. The main pre-requisite is a song grasp of Python. The more background you have in data mining the better. There's an expectation that you'll already have worked with a lot of different technologies just because it's the sort of thing that interests you. It's a great chance to put your stamp on a product and solve technical issues in the way that you think is best.I've been working with them on a part time basis for a couple of years now. They're growing and unfortunately I'm unable to meet their needs (due to other obligations). They need someone to come in and take ownership of the product and help them build a development team around it.They're great people to work with; passionate, reasonable and realistic. They understand the challenges of software and working with data - especially other people's.More information about the role is provided on their site [0].

      FujiFilm Medical Systems - Morrisville, NC (sorry, no remote, relocation available)Help us build a client-side framework for the next generation of medical imaging and medical information applications.We need JavaScript experts to help us build a responsive (from 4 monitors workstations down to a smart phone) content and application framework. Weâ€™re all about high-performance JavaScript. We have a team dedicated to measuring the performance of every build.Our challenges include:* completely removing ActiveX from the enterprise medical world.* Writing our own, faster versions of common JavaScript UI libraries.* Writing JavaScript that runs on one window, and manipulates the DOM on another. Did you know that, in IE, you canâ€™t invoke a constructor defined on one window from code loaded in another?* Creating real-time messaging systems between browser windows, desktop apps, and servers across a large geographically distributed facility.* Sharing the single JavaScript thread in a an N-window NM widget application. Hitting aggressive cold and warm start times.Weâ€™re still building the first version, a performant MVP, but when we start V2, there will be plenty of new challenges like writing 3D image viewers in NaCL and using WebGL and Canvas to display interactive radiological images.Send me an email if you are interested: fuji@beechtreetech.com
                      
                  
      If I understand what you're saying correctly, I don't believe you can invokee a constructor defined in one window within another window ever.  Javascript code is sandboxed to its current window/session in all browsers.  You can't have multiple windows interacting with each other without some form of server-side code being involved.  For what you're talking about (a web framework that has real time communication capabilities and can manage updates across multiple instances of the application on the same machine in different windows), you'll need to involve more than client side javascript.  Unless you're talking about using Node.js, which you don't mention here.
                      
                  
          var win = window.open(some_url_on_the_same_domain);
or    var parent = window.parent;

Now, you can access global variables on either parent or win.
                      
                  
      oh cool. In my head when I see that I just think spammy popup :) I can't recall seeing it used for a legitimate purpose.  But yeah that would accomplish what you're describing.

      Rentify - London, UKWe're on a mission to kill off high street letting agents and all the things they stand for: high fees, tenant rip-offs, and subscale economics.We're backed by world class investors (Balderton Capital) and have a senior leadership team comprised of bright minds from Uber, Eventbrite, NBC/Universal, Apple, and Zopa.This time last year our team was 4 people. Now it's 25. We're aiming to be 50 by the end of 2014. Good time to join and make a difference.We are in the market for Rails engineers (Buf will doubtless post more thorough descriptions on here), PPC managers, an office manager, and more. Feel free to reach out on here (email address in profile) or via jobs at rentify dot com.
                      
                  
      A word of caution regarding Rentify: I had some email correspondence with their CTO, Buff, last year when they had previously advertised on a "Who is hiring?" thread here, as I was then looking for something new in London.They asked me to complete a coding exercise, which I spent a Saturday afternoon doing ( https://github.com/jasonl/property_search )and submitted it to them, and then I did not hear back - not so much as a single email reply! - despite repeated follow-ups.If you're a Rails coder in London, you can definitely do better than a company that treats prospective employees as disdainfully as this.
                      
                  
      Jason, I'm so sorry for treating you disdainfully.  June 22nd, the day you sent over your test, I moved from San Francisco to London full time.  I assure you that you were the exception and not the trend as I don't always move across the world and sometimes emails slip through.  Ask anyone who has applied at Rentify since. I take extra time out to ensure that candidates understand what Rentify is and what we can offer to employees in terms of career growth. I even wrote a few lengthy articles about it here: http://bufordtaylor.com/post/62455729428/how-we-interview-en...To be fair, I thought that since you didn't return the coding challenge after 18 days that you simply weren't interested in the job.And if by 'repeated follow-ups' you mean one email, then I am guilty of that as well and you have my apologies.Furthermore, I'm assuming instead of 'last year' you meant June.Finally, my name is Buf.
                      
                  
      That doesn't sound like us. Apologies if it was overlookedâ€”not a fun experience to be ignored.
                      
                  
      Having just moved to London, all I can say: I really, really hope you succeed.
                      
                  
      Thanks! If you ever need a comfy office to work from once in a while, just let us know.

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We're a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.

      Layer (https://layer.com) San Francisco, CAThe Internet needs an open communications layer -- cross-platform and free from an advertising-supported business model. At Layer, weâ€™re on a mission to deliver it. Weâ€™re hiring iOS, Android, backend, Web and systems engineers, as well as designers.We have problems to solve that youâ€™ll have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Hereâ€™s why:Weâ€™re building our own network.  We need fine-grained control over latency and geographic distribution.  Weâ€™ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.Weâ€™re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.Weâ€™re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.Weâ€™re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.We care about documentation: https://layer.com/docs/ios.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.We care about design.  We wonâ€™t be releasing our own apps - thatâ€™s up to our customers - but weâ€™ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we donâ€™t have the keys we canâ€™t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)Today we're a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. Weâ€™re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.Weâ€™re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business. Weâ€™ve started and built world-class companies and highly scalable Internet infrastructure and invented protocols used by millions.Get in touch: jobs at layer dot com

      SpaceX - Los Angeles, CA http://www.spacex.com/careersWe seek to accelerate the course of human history by developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization.We build rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, utilizing much of our own electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldnâ€™t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.When considering you as a candidate, we wonâ€™t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that youâ€™re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that youâ€™re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. Youâ€™re the engineer that other engineers can count onâ€”youâ€™re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the teamâ€™s passionate dedication to the mission.At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and â€œlaunchingâ€� the product will be like no other product launch youâ€™ve ever experienced!
Note for new or recent graduates: If youâ€™re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!

      Trulia - San Francisco, Full time, (H1B transfers)Innovation happens every day.  http://youtu.be/YJHsr2ep1cw.Trulia is one of the largest real estate search platforms in the United States with over 40 million visitors across our platform every month. We're solving interesting problems and building cool things in nearly every software engineering discipline.We've got lots of interesting and large scale projects to tackle including:
Building our next generation of APIs (for both internal and external consumption)
Creating new mapping and data visualization experiences
Improving our web experience using a JS MVC framework and our new OOCSS library (similar to Bootstrap)
Innovating on our top ranked mobile apps
Diving deep into the terabytes of housing and user data we have in order to tailor custom experiences for our users
Our core web stack is a pretty traditional LAMP stack, but we use a ton of other technologies as well including: Python, Java, Hadoop, Solr/Lucene, CouchDB, Backbone (though we are currently exploring other JS frameworks as well), d3.js, Sass, Git, and a whole lot more.I've been an engineer at Trulia for over four years now and can honestly say that it is a really fun company to work for. There's a great culture of letting people run with projects that really interest them and drive the entire engineering organization forward.The perks are fantastic: 
great health benefits
unlimited vacation
monthly transportation and "well being" allowances,
lots of happy hours
kegs on two out of three floors
stocked kitchens, 
quarterly hack weeks to name a fewYou can checkout all the open positions and apply here - http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qzZ9Vfwm&...If you have any questions or want to chat you can also email me at tim[at]trulia.com
                      
                  
      Systems Programmer / Infrastructure Engineer at Keen IO - https://keen.io (San Francisco only, for now)Analytics Backend as a Service for modern developers (web + mobile + internet of things)Our API's usage is doubling every 6-8 weeks.  We need help supporting that load.Keen IO is a fully managed cloud API that lets developers build complex, hyper-custom, large-scale analytics and data science features directly into their web, mobile, or Internet of Things applications.Our currency is event data, and events are a pretty broad abstraction. Every time someone draws a breath, clicks a link, loads a website, pauses a song, or starts a car, there's an event. Events like these, in large aggregate, are extremely useful -- and therefore valuable :)It's probably worth mentioning that we're a platform company, not a product company. This means our customers are using the platform to build for an emergent and rapidly growing set of use cases. The same flexibility that makes us future-proof for a given customer also makes us future-proof from a market perspective. So while a product company seeks a certain kind of product-market fit, we allow product-market fit to come to us: our customers build it for themselves.Things we look for in a new team member:  â€¢ Learning agility 
  â€¢ Abstract reasoning 
  â€¢ Empathy
  â€¢ Potential is more important than credential 
  â€¢ Confidence, but tempered by humility & the drive to get even better

Some things we believe in:  â€¢ Mission = The Discovery of Truth.
  â€¢ Radical transparency 
  â€¢ Design with a capital "D" 
  â€¢ Introspection 
  â€¢ Distributed innovation 
  â€¢ The importance of laughter 
  â€¢ Relationships are everything 
  â€¢ Play to your strengths; patch your weaknesses with diverse collaborators

      If you could work anywhere, what would you do?- Wouldn't you want to work towards genuinely making the world a better place?- Wouldn't you want to work in a close-knit team alongside some of the brightest engineers in the industry?- Wouldn't you want to work on solving interesting problems that haven't been solved before?---At Khan Academy, I truly believe that you can find all of those things and more. We're a small, 50-person nonprofit tech startup making a big difference in the world. A few weeks ago, we found this great story through the fascinating blog "Humans of New York" â€“ please take a moment to read it:http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64412654576/i-struck-up-...This is just one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives that we've transformed, and there are thousands more we don't hear about.Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of math practice exercises. Our 100,000+ practice problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.This gives us the ability to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. As I write this we're running dozens of A/B tests to learn what we can do to make people learn more, from testing how review scheduling affects accuracy to simply testing different teaching styles.Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business â€“ though we have "celebrity" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.---I'm going to put in a special plug for mobile: Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two people (me and one other person) working on our apps right now. Our iOS app is fairly basic, but it already has a few million downloads. We want to make it awesome. If you're a mobile developer we can build a great team around, please reach out. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.We're hiring engineers (web, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. Oh, and if you want to have a great summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.Apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers directly (say you saw us on HN!) or feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org with any questions.[1]: http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...[2]: http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...
                      
                  
      > "You need: Authorization to work in the US"Understandable given your size yet personally quite disappointing :( Any plans for sponsoring visas in the near future?
                      
                  
      KA probably receives too many applications. Even when, some time ago, I was happy to volunteer for free, I just got an automated email and no response. Perhaps because of visa issues ? Or maybe there is too much supply because who would not want to help change the world ?
                      
                  
      If you never received a (human) response from us, that's a mistake on our part. I'm sorry about that.Unfortunately coordinating volunteers takes a lot of time and we haven't found it in our interests so far to really go down that road; in order to be able to move fast we're currently looking to hire only people with a longer-term commitment.
                      
                  
      Right now I believe we can sponsor renewals but not initial applications. I don't know of any immediate plans to change that, sorry.
