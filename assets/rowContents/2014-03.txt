Healthcare.govI'm part of a small team that's been working on healthcare.gov for the last few months alongside a bunch of other Google, Facebook, and Y Combinator alums.We'll always remember what Mikey told us in December, after the site was back up, could handle a non-trivial amount of traffic, and people who wanted health insurance could finally get it:"1 in 1000 uninsured people die each year. It's not an exaggeration to say that due to the work we're doing here, 5,000-10,000 people will live to see the end of 2014. You should be proud of what you've done, but we should also all be grateful to have this opportunity."We're all grateful to be here, but there's a hell of a lot more work to be done.If any of you out there are an amazing software engineer or SRE, and want to help make our government work better, please shoot us an email: brandon@hcgov.usFor more info, see:Obama's Trauma Team: Inside the Nightmare Launch of HealthCare.Gov

      It looks like the average across the whole population in the U.S. is 8 in 1000 people will die each year [1].[1] http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CDRT.IN
                      
                  
      Maybe the actual stat is that one in those eight people dies due to being uninsured?
                      
                  
      I bet a huge percentage of people dying are over 65 and have Medicare. You need numbers for those outside of that safety net to compare.
                      
                  
      Is this open for remote candidate?
                      
                  
      Right now, we're looking for folks who can move to the Baltimore/DC area for at least 1-3 months -- it's just hard to get stuff done in this environment without being here in-person!
                      
                  
      location?
                      
                  
      Right now, we've all been pitching in on 1-3 month rotations to the DC/Baltimore area. (If you'd be interested in helping but can't necessarily move to Maryland... stay tuned :) .)

      Question, asked on HN because others might be interested in the answer as well. Since you did not explicitly mention it in your post and I could not find this on your website either, I was wondering if you only hire locally (i.e. US) or are H1Bs welcome too?
                      
                  
      We have sponsored H-1B visas in the past for exceptional candidates.
                      
                  
      Has Oculus considered hiring interns? I am very interested and feel like I could make an impact.
                      
                  
      Transcriptic: Full-stack developer (emphasis on frontend)Menlo Park, CATranscriptic is "Amazon Web Services" for the life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.We're a small startup (you'd be #11), but well funded ($4.1M) and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.Recent coverage:- http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcript...- http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4...team at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers focusing on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs covering everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Learn more at http://amacapital.net/careers.html, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.

      Weft - http://weft.io - Boston, MA + San Francisco, CA. INTERN welcome.  ===========================
  ====== What we do =========
  ===========================

We're Waze for Cargo. Weft tracks shipping containers using low-cost hardware to make sure that shipments get to where they're supposed to be on time and intact, saving billions in lost value due to cargo shrink and disrupted supply chains. We  take the info we get from the hardware and figure out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predict whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically reroute/reschedule shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff.  ===========================
  ===== How we do it ========
  ===========================

Web stack -> clojure (immutant) + titan (really scary graph database on top of cassandra) -- we use middleman + enlive (and a bit of hiccup) for templatingAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)Hardware -> think cell phone on crack (atmel avr xmega, a bunch of sensors, gps, gsm, etc). Working integrated chip now! Have some pilots running with v1 hw.  ===========================
  ====== And the rest =======
  ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors!Looking for help at every point in the system (hardware, firmware, frontend, backend, algorithms, mobile, etc). Mostly focused on the data science aspect of Weft for the next few months.I should also probably mention that we have a team with a bunch of industry vets!If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!

As long as there is progress, we are flexible with regard to location and work hours.About you---------We are looking for Linux talent to work on our cloud services, deployed as Docker containers, but also to work on supporting arbitrary Linux-capable devices. The product is still young so you'll get a chance to have real impact on how the end result looks and feels to our users.Besides strong Linux skills, familiarity with Docker will help a lot. Much of our codebase (on cloud and device) is in node.js so JavaScript skill is a plus.The Process-----------Send us your CV (a pointer to source code online is a great plus).

      Xamarin (http://xamarin.com/) - San Francisco, full time, relocation availableAt Xamarin, we believe that great, native mobile user experiences have the power to transform customer relationships and employee productivity. Unlike other cross-platform mobile frameworks that deliver lowest common denominator experiences through UI abstraction libraries, we make 100% of the iOS and Android APIs available through our native bindings. Xamarin developers deliver high performance, fully native experiences and also share on average 75% of their source code across platforms.Xamarin is the only platform with complete API coverage and deep code-sharing capabilities across iOS, Android and Windows apps, for a total of 2.6 billion devices you can reach in C#.We have a number of positions available (http://xamarin.com/jobs), but I'm looking for Customer Success Engineers (http://xamarin.com/jobs/oHTMXfw3) to join our team.Basically, you will become our customers' trusted advisor â€“ providing technical expertise, on-boarding project guidance, and implementation assistance.It's a great opportunity if you already have the technical chops, but want to explore a different aspect of the business.Shoot me an email at valentin@xamarin.com if you have questions or would like to apply.
                      
                  
      San Francisco, CA | Cancer Therapeutics Innovation Group (CTIG)Help cure cancer by building webapps.At CTIG, we sequence the DNA of cancer tumors to recommend the right therapy for that tumor's specific DNA mutations. Patients and their oncologists use our analyses to help make decisions about how to treat their cancer. With us, you'd help build the systems that doctors and patients use to access and interpret our results, and work on the systems we use to manage our internal processes.It's really important that our users (patients and doctors) be able to understand the results we're giving back to them. So we're looking for someone who can translate our analyses into web pages that are clear, simple, and well-designed. That makes front-end experience and an eye for aesthetics important, but you'll be working on the backend as well.Our current web apps are built using:* Scala, with the Play framework* Python, with Django and Flask* Javascript, with Angular.js and D3* HTML/CSS/LESS with Bootstrap* PostgresIt's great if you're familiar with those, but general web dev skill and the ability to pick up new tools and technologies is more important. Our other systems also use R, and we're experimenting with the Julia language, so if you're looking to work with interesting technology then you'll find kindred spirits here.CTIG is located in Mission Bay in San Francisco, across the street from the UCSF campus here. We're a very interdisciplinary group, with bioinformaticians and computational biologists from UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and UCSF; biologists from UCSF, and physicians from Harvard Medical School. Some of us have PhDs, some of us have MDs, and some of us are college dropouts; we're not credentialists, but we do have strong backgrounds in our respective fields. It's a small team with 6 programmers, so you'd be a core contributor and you'd help set our technical direction.We're very serious about cancer, but pretty laid-back otherwise; office discussions range from the nitty-gritty details of molecular biology and machine learning to re-enactments of South Park episodes.We're looking for people who are authorized to work in the US, and can work full-time on-site in SF.  If you're interested, email me at mskinner@ctig.com, and include "EGFR" (the name of one of our favorite genes) in the subject.

We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support. Everyone talks to customers a lot.We're still a small team, so you'll have a large impact on company culture. We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook and Stripe and GitHub's cultures, and have as flat a structure as we can. We're looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.We're also looking for engineers for Developer Success and Developer Awareness positions. Since we have an incredibly technical product, and selling directly to developers, the dev-awareness positions (think marketing, but much more dev-oriented: dev evangelism, writing interesting blogs, CRO, analytics, etc - think a patio11-style engineer) require significant development experience. Dev-success positions are a good fit for engineers who like working with people and building relationships with customers.Check out our jobs page at https://circleci.com/jobs.

      San Francisco, CA - Zenbox. Software Engineer. [LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]We're a YC company with a private-beta sales tool that helps small and large companies catch opportunities from slipping through the cracks.If you've ever run a startup, you know how difficult it can be to stay on top of sales. And you also know how many companies fail because of it. We want to make them succeed.We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers.  * We run the SF ClojureScript meetup
  * Incredibly modern stack: written entirely in Clojure/ClojureScript/Om/React
  * Released the first reference Om app (https://github.com/sgrove/omchaya)
  * Given presentations on how we see app development trending http://sgrove.github.io/omchaya/docs/presentation.html (hint: It's about to get much, much better, and referentially-transparent UI's and serializable state play a big part)
  * We've vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler
  * Reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. 

We do all of this for two reasons: 1.) We want to build apps that customers love in the best way possible, and that often means taking the time to explore proper approaches. With the right team and stack, we run circles around others, and 2.) because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us.We're looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers.Interested in working with Reactjs, Om, and functional programming in the client?

We're currently rolling out our first two installations â€” in Dubai and in Moscow. And we just grew to ten people.Both the client part (iOS) and the video processing backend (Python/ffmpeg) are being actively developed in-house. We're currently looking for a Python developer, full-time in London. Our office is at TechHub, in the heart of the Silicon Roundabout, but we'll be moving to the new office in the same area very soon.The usual job description blurb is at our landing page at http://www.fountain-digital.com. I want to add that it's a great opportunity for a backend developer to get involved in a very serious wide-scale project. We're not in the business of making websites or Facebook apps, our video cloud routinely loads tens of large Amazon EC2 instances â€” and grows automatically as you add new video streams. We're really doing interesting work here.If you've never done Python in production, but love distributed systems, programming at scale and are a strong all-rounder â€” feel free to apply anyway. We love working with smart and hardworking people.If you want to ask anything about the product, technology, or anything else, drop me a line (I'm the CTO). My email is in the profile.No recruiters please.

      Guess what -- the link to your jobs page triggers a popup blocker under default Chrome settings.  The cross-domain URL, most likely.  Seriously, this should have been really obvious to whoever set that page up.But either way -- talk about going out of your way to make it difficult for people to find out why they might want to come work for you.

We're an enterprise SaaS company disrupting the fairly outdated enterprise education and training industry, an industry that has over 60% of its customers dissatisfied with current products!We've seen significant progress within our first year of business. We signed a Fortune 200 company to a six figure contract within our first months and successfully launched to that company at the beginning of 2014.Our product is built on top of a modern stack using best practices: an Angular client that communicates with a Rails 4 API, powered by Postgres, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We also have a strong focus on product and design (take a look at our product, and we think you'll agree). Traditionally, enterprise software has lacked in these areas, but we aim to disrupt that tradition.If you're at all interested or curious in exploring an opportunity with us, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at jamie[at]pathgather.com. We guarantee an amazing opportunity awaits: we'll offer significant salary and equity, the chance to work on real problems experienced by a wide audience, opportunities and rewards for open source work and contributions, and influence in our product, culture, and vision from day one!

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software. We're hiring for full time and summer intern positions as software developers and software designers.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    Recently, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),
    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us access
    to lots of cool machines.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, get in touch with me:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

Our HQ is located in San Francisco, CACompany Overview: Cotap helps people work better together. Weâ€™re building mobile tools to help people communicate and collaborate at work, whether theyâ€™re knowledge workers or line workers. Mobile phones can mean more than photo-sharing or checkins.

Weâ€™re funded, which means we can pay competitive salaries and offer benefits. Weâ€™re also small, which means we donâ€™t waste time on things like tracking vacation and sick days. Our passion is building great products and our goal is to bring them to a wider audience than the web ever let us reach. If that sounds like you, come join us.Look forward to hearing from you! http://boards.greenhouse.io/cotap/jobs/563#%2EUxOxXEJdV1s

      Academia.edu, San Francisco, CAAcademia.edu is trying to improve the way that scientific publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.
If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

Endgame â€“ San Francisco, CA (AT&T Park)Historically we've worked with customers in the Federal space, but we're aggressively moving towards building the next generation of security intelligence for private companies. Rock-solid security is usually not the _biggest_ priority for a startup, so we'd like to change that by making it easier and more accessible.We're opening an office right across the street from AT&T Park in San Francisco and have a boatload of open positions.We've got a lot of really smart people on our team. We're also very diverse, with a good mix of male and female hackers from all different cultures.

      Buffer (http://bufferapp.com)Hey everyone, hope your weekend is off to a killer start!February just came to a close and Buffer stands at 1.4M total users served by a small 16 person team spread across 12 cities and 5 continents. 130,000 of our users are actively using the product each month. We generated $333,000 in February, and we have $520,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I'm sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I'd love for you to be part of the incredible journey we've embarked upon.At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we're seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we'd love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.Do any of these areas stand out for you? I'd really love to hear from you:    - Reliability Hacker (we're sending 400,000 posts to social networks every day,
      our architecture is still not ideal)
    - Happiness (Support) Hacker (we have a crazy obsession for customer happiness
      and want to build our own tools to go beyond what's normal)
    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million downloads but currently no
      full-time developer!)
    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are all crying out for an
      iPad app)
    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%, we'd love your help
      improving it and many other metrics)
    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used Buffer, we'd love to improve
      our dashboard interface and extensions for them)

Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).    - We're completely open about salary and equity, in fact here is a spreadsheet
      of all individual salaries: https://docs.google.com/a/bufferapp.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE&usp=drive_web#gid=1.
      It's most likely you'd fall into a range of $85,000-$120,000 and 0.1%-1%.
    - We're a fully distributed remote team, and we come together 3 times a year for
      super fun retreats. The last one was in Thailand in December, our next is
      Cape Town in April!
    - We have a big focus on culture, that's the main thing we think about when someone
      joins the team. Here is our slide deck of values: http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-03 

I'll read through emails with our CTO Sunil, I hope yours might be part of that. Send him a quick note at thenexthacker@bufferapp.com. If you'd like you can check out more details about all the areas we need help with at http://jobs.bufferapp.comI'm excited about the chance to work with you.

      really impressed by your walking the talk and being open about user and revenue numbers.
                      
                  
      wow, thanks so much! let me know if I can ever help you with anything :-)
                      
                  
      Joel, are you guys looking for full time only or are there any part time positions as well?
                      
                  
      Hi! right now since it's still the early set of people for the team and we're establishing the culture, we're looking primarily for people who will be fully on board full-time. in the future I think we might reach a point where part-time could start to work. Hope that helps, let me know if I can answer anything else :-)
                      
                  
      What kind of PHP/etc related skills are you looking for? I wonder whether I could get in?http://justpaste.it/adnanprofile
                      
                  
      Hey Joel,I checked out the jobs page on the site and there doesn't seem to be a listing for internships? Do you guys offer any internships, specifically for college students?Thanks,
Viral
                      
                  
      Hi Joel, I see that the reliability hacker position wasn't filled yet, are you looking to hire DevOps/System Engineers or looking at hackers only?
                      
                  
      Hi Michael, we're certainly in need of help in terms of DevOps and Systems Engineering challenges too. Our architecture has a lot of room for improvement and we'd benefit a lot from having someone focus on systems. Let me know if you have any more questions here!
                      
                  
      Hey Joel,You and Buffer continue to be awesome. If I ever shut down my startup and work for somebody, I'd first apply to you. Is that a good enough compliment? :-)- Manu
                      
                  
      Hey Joel,You guys are doing a great job by taking the openness to a new level - love that! Sent an email for your backend position, would love to hear back from you.Regards
                      
                  
      Hey Joel,
Love Buffer's work culture and company philosophy! keep it up.
BTW have you guys filled up your UI design position?
Adit
                      
                  
      Hey Adit, thanks so much for the kind words, it's comments like this that make me excited to get out of bed every day and continue building the company and reflecting on the culture! We're still looking for help with design, would love to hear from you :-)
                      
                  
      Really happy I decided to read this thread before heading to bed tonight! Now to manage the waiting game. Thanks, Joel!
                      
                  
      Wow, so happy to hear that! Excited to check out your email :-)
                      
                  
      Joel, I sent Sunil an email. When do you think I'll hear back by?
                      
                  
      Are you at all considering hiring interns for the upcoming summer?
                      
                  
      We've pondered this a lot and have decided this Summer will be a little early for us to be set up for internship positions. I'm hoping we might do it next Summer!
                      
                  
      What if the intern acted as though it was full-time? I'm asking because I would be interested in applying for this summer. I know you're not looking, but I think I could really make an impact.
                      
                  
      Joel, are you open to sponsoring H1B visas?
                      
                  
      Yes, absolutely! I am a Brit living in San Francisco and my co-founder is Austrian. We know this process well having been through it personally for both of us and several others in the team.Our philosophy is that we should all have the opportunity to be in the single place on Earth that makes us the happiest and most productive, and we want to encourage you to find that place and help you be there. We have a fantastic immigration lawyer we work with and 100% success rate obtaining visas.
                      
                  
      You sound like an amazing CEO :) I really dig the company culture. 
If Buffer isn't hiring for Summer internships, I suppose hiring for a 16-month internship is out of the question?
                      
                  
      Wow, thanks so much. I still have a huge amount to learn :-) Luckily there are a lot of great books out there and mentors around who I can learn from in order to try and become the best CEO I can be.I think there's a chance a 16 month internship could work, be sure to get in touch :-) If you're self-driven and can add to the team and help us move forward, we'd definitely take a look!
                      
                  
      Done and done. Expect a pleasant email from me, Joel :)

      Flipboard: Palo Alto primarily, but NYC, Seattle, and Vancouver are options for the right candidate. We're hiring across the board, see a partial list here: https://flipboard.com/careers/Company is about 4 years old now, and we've raised a serious amount of capital to transform the media space.I run our publishing platform ( https://flipboard.com/publishers/ ), which we're investing in heavily this year in order to scale from hundreds of publishers to thousands and beyond.Our stack is a mix of Python, Java, and Node.js (with some Go, C++, and Scala here and there as well).One of our big challenges in this space is ingesting content from all over the Internet and normalizing it into something sane that can be displayed beautifully across all devices via algorithmic design. We use APIs, RSS, screen scraping, and midichlorians to get articles, images, videos, you name it. If you've dabbled in this space before, you know that it's a tough problem to get right. I'd argue we're best in class right now, but there's tons of room for improvement and we've only just begun.If any of this sounds interesting, get in touch with me: My user name @ Flipboard

      Just curious about the product, it seems like a more integrated version of the Chromecast, don't you see that as a problem competing? Or do you hope to one day merge?
                      
                  
      There are a lot of streaming devices that currently exist but none have made the experience seamless or simply enough for anyone to use.We see it as a similar market to MP3 players around 2001, prior to the iPod. Nearly anyone can figure out how to use an iPod, can't say the same for Chromecast.We also want to allow users to stream any app without having to wait for developers update their app with an SDK.It would be more accurate to say Chromecast is a small subset of Sugarcube.Shoot me an email if you have more questions sri <at> getsugarcube.comSri
                      
                  
      Taskflow.io - Business Development - Chicago, ILCOMPANY DESCRIPTION
Taskflow.io is a brand new idea on how businesses can run their internal processes. Every business has reoccurring processes that are in the heads of the employees and not formalized or tracked.When a business process is only in the head of a couple of employees things get forgotten, important data gets lost, critical steps are missed, and performance analytics are lost.Taskflow.io formalizes business processes online into a clean and easy interface to run a business's operations. Taskflow.io collects data on each step a business process, so nothing falls between the cracks and process performance can be easily tracked.JOB DESCRIPTION
You will be responsible for two things generating clients and keeping them happy. That's it. How you reach your goals is up to you.There are no scripts, there are no mandatory daily requirements. If you are independent and diligent in generating clients and keeping them happy, you will have no problem in this position. If you enjoy sitting on your butt twiddling your thumbs pretending to accomplish things, this job is not for you.QUALIFICATIONS
Genuine curiosity. Independence. Business to business sales experience. Track record of success.

      Kira Talent (https://www.kiratalent.com) - Toronto, CanadaAt Kira Talent, we help organizations find exception talent through video.A bit about us:  - weâ€™re a small team (youâ€™d be #15), based in the heart of downtown Toronto; 
    check us out at www.kiratalent.com/about/

  - weâ€™re had paying clients since day 1 of the company, and are well funded

  - weâ€™re hiring both  mobile and backend developers

  - we believe that even enterprise software can be beautiful, 
    and pride ourselves on our design 

  - every single one of our developers have committed code within their
    first day at work (some within their first hour), and because
    we love continuous deployment, so we're constantly pushing to
    production and seeing the impact of our work

Hereâ€™s some stuff weâ€™ve been working on lately:  - building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording 
    and streaming; imagine thousands of applicants from countries 
    all around the world submitting video interviews right before a deadline

  - designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and
    employers alike 

  - presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user,
    and our team internally

Our toolkit involves Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), MySQL (and some MongoDB), Celery, RabbitMQ, Wowza Media Server. We use AWS for hosting, CircleCI for continuous integration and GitHub for everything else (i.e. code reviews, issue tracking).If this sounds fun, letâ€™s chat!

      PillPack - Cambridge, MA (https://pillpack.com/)We're looking for developers to help us reinvent pharmacy to be delightfully simple. A non-trivial percentage of Americans take 5 or more prescription medications a day and they are being poorly served by the usual pharmacy experience: it's poorly designed, hugely inconvenient and doesn't actually focus on customer wellness.We launched about a month ago and both customer feedback and press coverage has been quite positive. Our customer base is growing faster than expected and we've got ample investment to fuel growth for a couple of years.We're a small team, so we're looking for coworkers who enjoy a great deal of autonomy and are as good at figuring out what to build as they are at building it. Our stack is currently Rails + Mongo + Foundation but prior experience isn't a necessity.Formal postings are on our careers page (https://pillpack.com/careers) but feel free to email me directly at jordan@pillpack.com if you'd prefer.

      Copenhagen, Denmark â€” Stealth Company is Hiring an iOS DeveloperAfter going through a famous US incubator and raising money from a whoâ€™s who of silicon valley investors, we have finalized a fundamental new technology that enables app developers to handle a lot more data in a lot less time and at a fraction of the battery life. But above all, our technology lets you manipulate data in a way that is extremely intuitive and a joy to use compared to todayâ€™s data frameworks: you get native data structures that you can just iterate on, standard access methods, and all the good stuff youâ€™d expect to be able to do in the 21st century. Thanks to this, developers are able to develop apps much faster, but also deliver on use-cases that are impossible to conceive today.We are now looking for a native iOS developer with at least 2 years full-time experience who can help us refine the product, make our native interface even more delightful, and build next-generation apps using it.We offer competitive salary, stock options, catered lunches and all the usuals bells & whistles. You can apply or ask us any questions at timanglade@gmail.com.
                      
                  
      New YorkJunior/Senior developers at DaisyBillWe're looking for 1-2 developers who are experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. We don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is a plus.We're also looking for someone at the CTO level.DaisyBill is located at 34 W 15th Street in Manhattan. We're a SaaS vendor serving the workers' compensation e-billing market.Workers' comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical e-billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that treats the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims/bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both generating and sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more, if at all.  This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.You can read more about our service offering at www.daisybill.com.The stack we currently run is Rails 3 on Heroku.We use Git for source control and use Macs for development. We develop in an agile manner in the style of ThoughtWorks and Pivotal Labs, using Pivotal Tracker. We like our code to have tests, and as such we have an extensive suite covering the Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript code on the site.Please send all inquiries to jobs@daisybill.com.

      Mountain View, CA (Need to be authorized to work in the US)Treasure Data is hiring a business development representative. Please see the job description here: http://www.treasuredata.com/en/careers/careers-posting-005.p...We are a Mountain View based startup making it super easy for people to get value for their ever-growing datasets.Aside: Last summer, I posted a similar job post here for summer internship, thinking not much about it. A couple of days later, we got an email from a college student in Puerto Rico who meekly asked us to take a look at his GitHub.He had some stuff there that looked cool, and more than anything, we needed to hire a frontend engineer. So, we gave him a 24-hour coding quiz, he passed it, we gave him a round of phone interviews, and he passed that too.Two weeks later, he was in our office writing Rails and JavaScript as our first summer intern.The best part? He is still with us. He decided to take a leave from college and instead make our frontend slicker that we could ever imagined.

(This was already our priority before yesterday, I promise)We like working on npm because JavaScript is fun, and solving problems that lots of people have -- about how to share code, deploy it, and scale it -- are really rewarding.

We have a strict no-assholes policy.We are also accepting applicants for a summer internship.

The web front-end runs on AngularJS and weâ€™re currently working on our mobile apps running on Phonegap for Android and full native for iOS.Weâ€™re hiring for two roles: 1) a versatile developer whoâ€™s comfortable with our stack and an expert in front-end development, and 2) an Android engineer who is obsessed with building the absolute best user experience that Android can provide.PERKS & CULTUREWe've worked with excellent contractors for our MVP, and   we're now looking for people who are ready to commit to a startup and (if possible) join us in London. You'll have real influence on the product, strategy, team and culture with the freedom and responsibility to turn plans and ideas into reality.We believe that you need to work when and how youâ€™re most productive to deliver results, so we have flexible work hours and donâ€™t count your days off (insist you take at least 22 of them per year).You'll help define our company culture and decide what perks would interest you - conference/travel budget, ideal workstation setup, free lunch...?We want our team to share in the success of the company, so you can choose a combination of cash and equity to suit your financial situation.If you're not in London, but are happy to move here from somewhere else in the UK/Europe, then we'll help you with expenses, finding accommodation and settling in.To apply please send us an email at jobs@togethera.com with a bit about yourself and products youâ€™ve built.

      Complete Automation Resource (http://completear.com)Rockford, MI (near Grand Rapids), not remote, but frequent work-from-home opportunitiesDevelopers, PLC programmers, Controls EngineersWe do industrial integration, meaning we get to program lasers and robot arms (my last week). We also build machines, write lightweight mobile apps, and create interfaces to machines that weren't built with one in mind.Relaxed atmosphere, frequent new projects, ever expanding business. Everyone says disruptive, but the monitoring package we build with allows us provide services at about a fourth of what the traditional options cost (and usually the same factor of development time).We use Python and SQL (Server, but increasingly postgres) every day, but I've dipped into Java, Objective C, and a smidgeon of VBA on the job.For developers, the languages you know are not as important as your ability to solve new problems, learn and grow.We are also looking for PLC programmers and/or Controls Engineers.If interested, see my profile for contact info.

      Khan Academy â€” Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)We're a small, non-profit tech startup trying to give a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We're making a big mobile push and need your help.Here's a testimonial we received recently:==================================Hi! My name is Chelsie and I'm a college student. When I was 19 years old I was kicked out of a great university because I had terrible grades. My disappointed parents cut me off financially so I began working night shifts to support myself. The truth is, I had no desire to go to school because learning had always seemed very distant from reality to me. ... Success in school felt like something you either had or you didn't, and I had been getting Cs since middle schoolâ€¦.I stumbled across [your] videos about math. I HATED math. I watched them anyway. I don't know why, but I did. I loved them. I continued watching videos- chemistry, programming, physics. I'm 24 now, and I'm in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As. Sal's videos made me feel like I had the capacity for understanding math and science even though my parents never sent me to space camp and I never won a ribbon at a science fair in elementary school...==================================Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who're thankful for free, high-quality educational content.Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.And now we're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We're totally overhauling our iOS app.If you join us now, you can be a core developer on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.You'll be part of a small team working alongside both "celebrity" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more of us normal folk ;) you haven't heard of but who are workin' hard to help education.Apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers and be sure to mention that you're coming from HN. Feel free to email me at ben+HN@khanacademy.org w/ random questions.

      LiveLoop - San Francisco, CA============================LiveLoop is doing for people's documents what Skype did for their faces.In any business meeting today, people have hundreds of tools for voice and video collaboration, but nearly every meeting has an associated PowerPoint presentation that gets emailed to the group 5 minutes before the meeting. If you need people to refrain from flipping through the document, you typically use a heavyweight screen-sharing program like WebEx.Instead of all this, we're building a live presentation tool that allows people to collaborate on presentations in keystroke-by-keystroke real-time, both from within PowerPoint itself and on the desktop and mobile Web.It's hard to explain fully and our website (http://getliveloop.com) doesn't have anything about the interesting new things we haven't shipped yet. So get in touch at amal@getliveloop.com .Competitive salary and above-competitive equity.

      San FranciscoIntransRuby EngineerThe last 50 years have seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that. We've deployed the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.Over 30 billion dollars a month is spent on trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry still runs on landlines and fax machines. We are changing that by using location-based technology to automatically match supply and demand.
We're a team of 10 and have been around for over two years. We're growing quickly and looking for a Ruby engineer to join us.If you're ready to be part of this industrial transformation, send your resume and GitHub profile to sean@intrans.com.
