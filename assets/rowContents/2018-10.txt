      Hi, would you be open to hiring remote candidates in Canada (pacific time zone)?right now we can only hire within the USThat's a lot more paperwork, especially if you want an actual employee, not a "soulless contractor" that is not attached to your company.I am a remote employee in a startup, and it requires way more paperwork (options, vacation, legal) to do things right. For a small company, that's just too much when you can hire someone in your country.
                      
                  
      Don't think I am qualified enough to apply to this job. I just wanted to say I appreciate your company and product so much. I have been trying and successfully converted 22 people from whatsApp and IOS messaging to use signal and they really enjoy the app. I wish you guys the best> Don't think I am qualified enough to apply to this job.Don't let you be the judge of that, let them. People frequently knock themselves down for no reason. If you're interested apply, if they're not interested maybe you'll know what you can work on to improve yourself. Maybe though they think you can be part of their team.
                      
                  
      Can I jump on this bandwagon? I also seriously appreciate what Signal is doing and they deserve to hear it more oftenthxCoinbase | Payments Engineering | San Francisco, Chicago, London | Full-time | OnsiteAt Coinbase (YC S12), our vision is to bring more innovation, efficiency, and equality of opportunity to the world by building an open financial system.Weâ€™re looking for people to join our Payments Engineering team.

      Came across Superhuman from the May â€œWhoâ€™s Hiring?â€� post. Currently on the iOS team. Just wanted to say youâ€™ll learn a lot working here. Not just with engineering, but with product and growth as well.Any use for backend devs or is it a shop where everyone is an engineer and the division of labor is not in title but on what you're working on at any given moment?Iâ€™d be open to talking through a backend-focused role, though because we run a search engine and sql database in the browser realistically we end up doing most of the traditionally â€˜backendâ€™ work (like search and storage) in the clients.That said we do have a go backend that doesnâ€™t have a full time owner just now.
                      
                  
      I'll send you an email in the morning. I was wondering how your email service was so friggin' fast -- doing a lot of that client side makes sense.Email sent.Would you be open to recent grads?Huawei Canada | Software Engineers | Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | ONSITE | FULL-TIME/ INTERNHuawei is kickstarting a team to build the tech stack that will power the next generation of the internet.

      > For remote, we have strong preference for US timezone. For onsite, we offer 30 days of paid vacation, fully covered health benefits (gold/platinum plan), commuter benefits, cover costs of visiting conferences, and more.Does this imply that remote employees do not get any of these benefits? Or am I just reading it incorrectly?
                      
                  
      We do offer some of the same things, mostly around vacation time. The rest is just simple not possible. We're trying to see if we can do more direct hiring, but for that we need to grow the remote team more for it to make sense.Interesting - could you elaborate on why it's "not possible"? Sounds like you want to access to a broader pool of talented candidates without compensating them fairly. At least that's the impression I'm getting.If you are open to remote _contractors_ I suggest being more explicit about that.
                      
                  
      Why would you think we're not compensating them fairly?There are many challenges to hire people in other states, even more in other countries. Too much for a small company to deal with.

      Render (https://render.com) | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineers and Designers | Full-time | All visas except new H-1Bs | OnsiteWhen deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new classes of applications.We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and Postgres, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for people with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.We're serving live applications in production and building our founding engineering and design teams in SF. The company is backed by the same investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe, as well as the former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox.I'm the founder and would love to hear from you if this sounds interesting.

There is L1 but L1 requires the employee to be working for the foreign office of the US company for at least a year before he/she can be issued L1.So which are the visas you are sponsoring when you say "all visas except new H-1Bs"?
                      
                  
      We can sponsor H-1B transfers, TN visas for Canada/Mexico citizens (we did this for Render's first engineer), H-1B1 visas for Singapore citizens, and pretty much any other work visa that's not a new H-1B. If you're on an OPT, we will file a new H-1B for you because you're already here.We will eventually grow out of this constraint, but it's personally frustrating because my own first job out of college was on an H-1B visa.
                      
                  
      Interested. Applied to the full stack role just now!Curios for the reasoning for not accepting new H-1Bs?Two reasons:1. Given the limited number of H1-Bs, there's only a ~35% chance we'll be able to get the application approved.2. New H-1B applications will only be accepted in April 2019, but we're looking to hire now.

We're helping dentists capture hundreds of thousands of dollars more than with legacy tools through schedule optimization and improved claims management--and no, that's not just hype, it's real. We've just landed a $16M Series A, led by Accel, Eight Roads Ventures and F-Prime Capital Partners, and we're expanding our development team from India to the United States. The company has product-market fit and our onboarding pipeline has filled up nicely. Now it's up to the engineering team to really turn the product into something special--something that our customers are delighted to pay us for. Having that kind of product-market fit so early and reducing a lot of it to technical problems is a different situation than a lot of startups at this stage, but it makes things a whole lot more fun.Right now, we're in need of product-minded senior and principal-level frontend developers who have a track record of making sustainable long-term decisions. Our stack is .NET (though .NET experience isn't required) and Angular 1/TypeScript; the future of the usual frontend may be a modern version of Angular or a move to React, and it's largely up to the leaders of our frontend team to decide. (Our mobile work will probably be React Native.) In addition to technical and architectural competence, a big part of the role is helping to socialize good practices to our existing developer base as well as to forge ahead with the usual: new features, performance and stability improvements, and the like.As for me, I'm the Director of Infrastructure here--I was impressed enough by the company and the team to wind down my consulting business to come here. For those of you who know me from HN, you know that I'm big on generosity, kindness, and competence, and I'm happy to say that this team is better at all of the above than any team I've ever worked with in the past. We all teach; we all learn. It is a pleasure to come into work everyday.Our team is primarily Boston-centric--I was the first engineer hired into this office, we're up to 7 local now. We do offer relocation for the right candidates and we will consider remote hires.eropple@carestack.com - put "[HN WHO'S HIRING]" in the subject line.

I'm a developer who has been working at Cogent for the past 6 years and I love it here. I moved across the world for this job and I haven't regretted it for a second. Cogent is a lovely, warm and humane company. I've managed to convince my boss to let me travel the world and work remotely a couple of months per year. I also work part-time so that I can work on my videography business, and nobody raises an eyebrow at that. It's all very flexible!Cogent is kind of a consultancy. We have a vision of becoming "Melbourne's most loved maker of novel digital businesses". So a lot of what we do is based on working out of clients' offices. But we do other things as well. I spend my time working on a pretty damn cool electric car charger startup we've invested in.We're a values-driven company, which gives us benefits such as an open salaries model, profit share and a strong focus on work-life balance like the flexibility mentioned above. We also work with clients that align well with our values.Cogent is looking for mid-level and senior software developers with 5+ years of experience. We use Ruby and JS quite a bit, so commercial experience with those would make us go "ooooh!"If this sounds interesting, have a look at our site: https://cogent.coOr drop me an email to ask me about life at Cogent or in Australia: peter@cogent.co

We do this to allow biologists to disseminate their work in a runnable form to other labs. We're currently hiring Scala engineers to help us with this. Our entire stack is in Scala, from our compiler to our graphical UI for biologists to our device drivers. We interface with sensors and lab equipment to provide abstractions that allow biologists to write their lab protocols as formal programs, constraining the acceptable environmental conditions in their protocol, which we check at compile time to provide error logs and insight into why protocols may not reproduce.If you enjoy formal logic, theorem provers, user experience design, or driver development, we really like those too. Parts of how our product works are technically awesome, with some cutting edge research into theorem prover optimization and heuristic generation making our product possible.We've just cleared our Seed round, with investors like MIT's The Engine, Y Combinator, and Firstminute capital. We're a rapidly growing team that could use a person like you. Even if you don't meet all of our requirements, we're happy to talk and see if we can work together.

We are looking for experienced developers to maintain and break our back-office solution into focused micro services.Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071About BBOXXLack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.Check out our impact here http://www.bboxx.co.uk/customers/

      Software Engineering Institute (SEI) | Compiler Researcher  | Pittsburgh, PA, USA | ONSITEOur team is developing techniques for automatically repairing C source code to remove memory-safety vulnerabilities.  The ultimate goal is to enable a proof of some or all aspects of memory safety of the repaired program.  By repairing at the level of source code (as opposed to a compiler pass, like AddressSanitizer or SoftBound+CETS), the user isnâ€™t tied to a particular build chain.  Furthermore, although the goal is to as automatic as possible, nevertheless it is likely that the developer will need to manually tune performance-critical sections of the codebase, which is facilitated by doing the repair at the source-code level.We are looking to hire someone with experience in static analysis, compiler development, or formal verification.  The successful candidate will both work on advanced research projects and work directly with customers to help transition our research into practice.  Candidates will be subject to a background check and must be eligible to obtain and maintain a Department of Defense security clearance.If interested, please email your resume to me at weklieber+hiring@sei(DOT)cmu(DOT)edu.
