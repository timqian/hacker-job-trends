      Codified Genomics - Houston TX (remote OK)
codifiedgenomics.comSoftware you write at Codified will directly influence healthcare decisions for thousands of patients. We're looking for experienced software engineers who are up to that challenge, and who have a track record of working in an environment that demands a high level of quality.We do clinical genomic variant analysis. We take whole exome sequence data and predict clinical outcome for the variants we observe in patients, which is then used by clinicians to inform treatment.

We started with seed funding and are currently profitable with revenue from our first customer.We're hiring our first engineer. At Codified your responsibilities will be wide - you will probably end up touching every piece of software we write, with an emphasis on the user facing applications. We are currently using GWT and mysql with some scripting in Python. Additionally, you'll help us grow our team over the next few months as we continue to add engineers.We have a large number of interesting projects under active development, spanning natural language processing, machine learning, user interface design and of course sequence analysis.We're looking for someone who is experienced, flexible and willing to work outside of their comfort zone. A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the job will require you to learn the basics of the Biology that we're working with.We're willing to consider remote work for experienced candidates, but preference will be shown to candidates in the Houston area.We are offering 70k+ salary and equity.

Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.We are:    - recent University of Cambridge graduates 
    - one director at the Max-Planck Institute

      Off topic.Having had a melanoma myself, this area obviously interest me.Have you thought about a grander vision i.e. using a high def camera taking picture of he entire body in one snap and then analyzing that data?I have more than a thousand moles, many of them abnormal, so using a camera on a per spot basis is simply not safe enough with the current technology.
                      
                  
      We're aware our core change-detection engine has many uses, particularly in the medical space. We're focussed on making a home-tracking service for moles to start out with that works with smartphone to begin with, although we plan to branch out into other areas as the company grows. We're not like the many apps out there that will tell you whether or not you have cancer for $2.99, we're working with dermatologists, GPs and image processing experts to make a service that is robust and safe.We have a grant from the UK's Technology Strategy Board - a Government initiative - to research video-based capture instead of our current photo-based approach. This would alleviate many of the problems you've highlighted with regards to the convenience of capturing the data. Video capture would be the main focus of the person we hire.We're also keen to point out we're not a diagnosis service, nobody but a trained medical professional can tell you whether or not you have a melanoma. All we're doing is helping you spot change as soon as possible.
                      
                  
      Thank you for your thorough answer.And yeah not even the dermatologist can yet tell you whether you have a melanoma or not, for that an actual sample is required.Perfect solution for early detection in my mind would be some sort of drug or cream that would highlight which moles are melanomas and then somehow allow of a system to see that highligh (ex. change for color)But just wanted to say I am glad there are someone out there working on it.

You'll be the 4th member, and technical lead, of an incredibly talented team with a track record in insurance, startups, consumer marketing and design/UX. We have had a successful alpha phase and are already revenue positive.http://knowitowl.theresumator.com/apply/Do you want to solve:A problem with scale.  Insurance is a $2 trillion industry.  Thatâ€™s 36 times larger than Google and Facebook combined. Insurers pay their aging sales force a mint to sell insurance the old-fashioned way (with paper, face-to-face). Weâ€™re going to change this.A problem thatâ€™s socially important.  Nobodyâ€™s helping people figure out insurance â€“ and thatâ€™s bad. Under-insured medical problems contribute to over half of all personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures.  Weâ€™re going to deliver social impact.A problem in desperate need of a new approach. The consumer problem in insurance is deceptively simple: insurance is hard to sell because people donâ€™t want to think about bad things like death and illness. Insurers just throw money at the problem: advertising, hefty commissions, pushy sales agents. Weâ€™re introducing a new approach.Weâ€™re looking to build our team with people who understand the importance of what weâ€™re doing and want to apply their talent and energy to solving a Big Problem. Weâ€™re searching for Davids ready to take on Goliath. Come join Virgil and the KnowItOwl team to bring the $2 trillion insurance industry into the 21st century.
                      
                  
      Cool.  There's a few other companies attacking similar but unrelated verticals also in NYC.Your post has pizazz, but it doesn't communicate to the CTO candidate what the day to day will look like. Otoh, many places that do CTO searches at your size have some amount of technical debt.  I know a few folks who are great at removing technical debt.
                      
                  
      Thanks for replying. If you click the link you can find more detail on the day-to-day of the role. Our initial products are quite light and so it's very much a white canvas for the next phase of development.

Ill take a look later today to tease out interesting ideasYeah, C with some nice clang error messages is a much simpler language than c++.I actually gave a talk last month about how to hook into the GHC rts using c or c-- (c-- is kinda like llvm IR with c syntax).    Which reminds me, I need to catchup with the gsoc student I'm mentoring, he's writing a semiautomatic c++ ffi wrapper for Haskell.  I should go do that.
                      
                  
      Perfect Audience - SF, CA - Dev OpsAbout the Position:
One of the most important roles in the build-out and maintenance of this system to fill is the dev-ops / automation engineer role. We need someone to help us assemble the airplane as it is taking off, so we need a strongly independent candidate that understands teamwork and compromise. You'll have a lot of autonomy in this role, and will be making big choices on a rapidly scaling application. Don't read this as you will not be supported, quite the opposite. Read this as we value your opinion and work and expect you to be deeply integrated within our team. We need to be able to depend on you, and you need to be able to depend on us.What we are looking for:- Our concurrent code is built in Java and handles thousands of requests a second, 24/7. We need help keeping it happy and behaving well from deployment, to scaling to everyday operations.- We run on a variety of Amazon Web Services like DynamoDB, EC2 and SQS - we need to get the most out of it. Prior experience here is a huge plus.- Our code handles thousands of dollars worth of transactions a day, and is up 24/7 so we need to monitor everything. We like Scout, Nagios and Graphite. If you have strong feelings about why these are the wrong tools, we would love to hear that too.

      Swift Software - Frederick, MD (Near DC) - Software Engineers
Are you tired of commuting to DC or Northern Virginia? Swift Software is a growing product-centered technology company seeking talented developers to join our product team in Frederick, MD. Our flagship product is JobTraQ, a task management and workflow system that offers vastly more flexibility and power than any other product in our market segment, and is significantly less expensive and easier to configure than big "BPM" suites like MetaStorm and Lombardi. These advantages are allowing us to disrupt both markets.You will create new features in JobTraQ and enhance existing functionality. Youâ€™ll help us build advanced visual design and administration tools, augment the product's business intelligence capabilities, improve performance and scalability, and use customer feedback to enhance all parts of the system.Our team has an enjoyable and collaborative culture in a creative environment. We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base. Our environment is relaxed and fun, we play everything from Total Annihilation to Alien Swarm at our game nights, and we equip everyone with new quad-core Thinkpads with SSDs and dual monitors. Our policies and benefits are family-friendly, with generous vacation time, good health insurance options, and flexible work schedules.For more information about this position, see the link below. If you are interested, please email your resume to resumes@swiftsoftware.com.http://www.jobtraq.com/jobs/se227-software-engineer-product-...
                      
                  
      > Total AnnihilationWhere do you stand on Supreme Commander (and Forged Alliance) vs Supreme Commander 2? Everything hangs on your response.
                      
                  
      A couple of us played Supreme Commander and liked it, but we all went back to TA for some reason. Read the bad reviews of SC2 and never tried it.
                      
                  
      Most of the time I find people who miss TA miss nuclear arms races. That glorious 10 minutes of screen shaking in the late game when hundreds of nuclear missiles fly back and forth and we get to see who built enough strategic defence.(None of which is relevant to your job posting. Sorry.)
                      
                  
      Our games usually devolve once we hit the unit limit, since we're too lazy to find that 5000-unit patch from the old days. From that point, we go for nukes, berthas and targeting facilities, or just massive air waves.We really should try out SupCom with more than a couple of people. My guess is that it would be a great fit for the types of players we have. (-:
                      
                  
      Yes, definitely. It's the truest successor to TA, and in the same spirit. It retains the flux economic model, upgrade-by-building, powerful UI features (building group templates are awesome) and a plethora of options on how to optimise your work.Plus the whole vast-armies-of-destiny thing. I have very much enjoy games where it devolved down to 16 megaunits vs 150 strategic bombers ...

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team of software craftsmen (10 of us right now) passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we're more concerned with using the 
    right tool for the job. In the past two months, I've worked with Objective-C,
    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, 
    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with
    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - Affordable housing. If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the 
    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought 
    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my 
    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of
    startups. The energy here around the growth in technology and the support
    for entrepreneurs is infectious.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why youâ€™re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

      IFTTT - http://ifttt.com/jobs - San Francisco, CAIFTTT is looking for experienced engineers to help build the next generation of its platform. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the webâ€™s most innovative and exciting services. Youâ€™ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.IFTTTâ€™s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. Weâ€™ve built a system that enables users to set up simple â€œif this, then thatâ€�-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.Weâ€™re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but weâ€™re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end weâ€™ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. Weâ€™re hoping you can be the next one.

Ideally in the ETL or BI space. The application you would be working with primarily would be Informatica PowerCenter [http://www.informatica.com].

      Hello,
Interviewstreet Handle: Avijit
Hacker Email ID: avijitsinghthakur18@gmail.comBiggest Failure: In 2007, I went for a Hindi Declamation Contest where I need to give a presentation against a big crowd on topic. I saw the crowd and stood still like a statue. I prepared for that contest for 7 days but biggest mistake I did, I was preparing for the content in my speech but not for how I should face the crowd. That day everybody laughed. I went back, my father told me that day, Avi see when we go on stage even if we perform good or bad that crowd is not gonna kill or hurt us then why we should get scared of them. Its your voice which is controlling them. Today I am a good presenter in result of that lesson.Biggest Achievement: I always considered myself as a programmer but when I first saw Interview street and its challenges I realized my true level. Improving myself as a programmer here to analyze a problem more precisely is one among my biggest achievement . I am proud that today I am more or less a programmer.Regards,

      Hello Sir,
          I am Ahmar Md Hashmi,a student of Bengal Engineering & Science University, Shibpur from the department of Computer Science & Technology currently studying in final year(B.Tech).My strongest forte is my determination and never-say-die attitude.I am an avid learner and a lover of technology.I am currently a Microsoft Student Partner as well.My global rank at hackerrank is 739 and country(India) rank is 156.My biggest failure is not having been able to crack the IIT after my class XII.Nevertheless,I am a strong believer in God and believe that whatever He does is for our own good.
                                           Thanking you,

      Hello sir, 
I am Bishwanath Mandal ,studying in Bengal Engineering & Science University, Shibpur from the department of Computer Science & Technology in final year(B.Tech). 
Biggest failure : I did not take IIT JEE seriously when I should have. I don't know if I could have cleared it , but atleast I should have tried. For me failure is not to try.
Biggest Achievement : But now I am confident about myself that given a task I will try with my full commitment.I have been selected for Summer Research Fellowship Program at IIT Delhi. I was a school topper in my class 10 examinations and currently I am in top 3 students of my Computer Science batch.

      Hello sir, I am K Rohit Rao from Kharagpur, pursuing B. Tech from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur. I am presently in final year(Computer Science and Technology). IIT JEE seems to be the heart breaker for everyone, broke my heart twice. Almost cried like a baby but I learnt a lot from it.
 I was one of the toppers in school. I secured Third rank in city in dRSHTi, an All India Aptitude Test. Though I consider myself an average programmer but i am determined to  learn. I am hardworking and love to keep my grey cells active.

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure, down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.http://amacapital.net/careers.html

The fitness options today work for the highly motivated but not for the rest which is evident in the rising obesity rates in the country.We want you to come help us design our user experiences. Our users are across all age groups, some who are fit and some who are wanting to be more fit. Our design challenge is to build a product that makes it really easy for users to do a workout from end-to-end by getting out of their way and wowing them with the experience.We think any of our team mates should have the following traits. Hardworking, analytical and a great sense of humor. They should be serious about their work, but not take themselves too seriously. We recommend that you try our product so you can tell us how you can make us better.Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We graduated from Rock Health in Spring and have some great investors who get marketplaces such as ours. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer.

We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.Contact us at jobs@wello.com or ping me at amol@wello.com with your resume.

      Recruiter spam ^(edit) This is "Who's hiring" thread and it has always been a place for companies to post their own direct-hire positions. Allow recruitment agency postings and both the quality and the value of these threads very quickly go down the drain. I realize that you mean well, but that's not the thread for your ads unless you are willing to disclose the name of the companies you are proxying.
                      
                  
      If it helps, I'm a real hacker :) Here's some of my open-source code: https://github.com/OvidHere's some more of my open-source code: http://search.cpan.org/~ovid/Here's my tech blog where I give advice to other hackers: http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/I'm a hacker trying to help other hackers live their dreams and I give freely back to the community.> This is "Who's hiring" thread and it has always been a place for companies to post their own direct-hire positions.I realize that you disagree with recruiters being here. The lead paragraph for the "Who is Hiring" threads says the following:> Please lead with the location of the position and include the keywords INTERN, REMOTE, or H1B if the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. Feel free to post any job that may interest HN readers from executive assistant to machine learning expert to CTO.I've never seen anything which states "no recruiters". We specifically looked for that because we didn't want to violate any TOS or alienate those we are trying to help.I'm sorry you disagree with how we've handled this, but we honestly do try to help people live anywhere in the world. The fact that I've also been writing a blog helping people do this for years should help back that up.When candidates contact us with their CV and express an interest in the jobs, we immediately tell them who is hiring and why. It's hard enough for those who dream of living abroad to find companies willing to help them. Why restrict their opportunities?
                      
                  
      > If it helps, I'm a real hacker :)Yes, you have "Perl" in your profile, but it doesn't matter, sorry.> Why restrict their opportunities?To not set a precedent for other recruiters. This thread will snowball into an utter dump once more recruiters get a whiff it. And posts like yours set up the stage just for that.
                      
                  
      Have you even seen the list of contributions and modules he has?? That is way different of just having "Perl" in his profile.About the snowball of utter dump... that's what downvotes are for.
                      
                  
      Being offered a job through one of Ovid's previous Who's Hiring posts, I would say it did not seem to me like going through your normal agency routine.
So, +1 from me aswell.BTW, he wrote this too: http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781118013847/
Know any other recruiters that do that ? :)
                      
                  
      My vote is Ovid gets a pass. Been learning from his Perl posts for 10+ years.

      Your link points to a subdomain of silkroad.com. I've never heard of the HR company that owns that domain, but the name "Silk Road" is fairly notorious for referring to a contraband marketplace: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/silkroad/Unless you'd like to associate your brand with drugs and debauchery, I don't think you should link to anything including the words "Silk Road".I'm also surprised that company hasn't changed their name. Through no fault of their own, their brand name is now toxic.
                      
                  
      Yup, well aware of "Silk Road", although not in my power to change that provider. I'll take this as a reminded to double check HR is aware though. Thanks.

      Interaction / Interface Designer â€“ EyeQuant.com â€“ Berlin, GermanyEyeQuant is a SaaS company that uses neuroscience and machine learning to optimize interfaces for higher conversion rates. We're spun out of Caltech, our customers include Google and Spotify and we're backed by some fantastic investors.We're now looking for our first full-time designer to join our team of 7 in Berlin. You'd be responsible for all interaction and visual design in our products.Here's what we think is important about the role:    â€¢ Code â€“ You won't be expected to write production code, but you should know
      your medium well: what's possible with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and what's easy 
      or hard. Most importantly, you know how to communicate effectively with your 
      developer peers.

    â€¢ User research â€“ You should care deeply about the people you're designing for, 
      and willing to get involved in research. If you're passionate about running 
      guerilla user research for the team yourself, that's great, but not a 
      requirement.  

    â€¢ Interaction vs. visual design â€“ All else being equal, we prefer someone who is 
      great at organising information and making complex flows feel simple over 
      someone whose core strength is crafting beautiful interfaces. We're a small 
      team though, so you will be doing a bit of both. 

All that said, none of us come from a design background, so we'd love to hear from you if you disagree with any of the above and think you'd be a fit!You should come with an interest in quantitative evaluation of design efforts - both with our own products and A/B testing. If you think that's heresy, you won't be happy at EyeQuant. If you believe that design and science have a lot to learn from each other, you'll have a shot at shaping the very industry itself.Get in touch at: niko@eyequant.com

      London, UK - M7 Real Estate - Full Stack Web DeveloperI am Oli the Technology partner at M7 Real Estate and I am looking for a full stack web developer to work from our London Office.  I can't accept remote workers for this role, but you'll be working from our 7th Floor Office in Marble Arch with awesome views of Hyde Park.You will be the first dedicated developer to join the business, reporting directly to me who has been the sole developer to date.  Due to the small nature of the team I really need someone self-motivated who is keen to take on new challenges and is happy to just get stuff done to help us drive our business forward.  This is not a heavily structured development team environment and you need to be comfortable with that.You need to be just as happy working with relational databases, querying them and also hand coding the standards compliant HTML / CSS to sit on top of them.  Typical projects involve PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JQuery.  Experience of CakePHP would be brilliant, as would any C# experience but neither of these are deal breakers.  Source control is GIT and the rest of your tools are broadly up you.As well as our internal systems, we also provide outsourced web development services to 3rd parties so you will get to work on a diverse range of projects.  Our core business is in the process of going through a rapid period of expansion and to support that we are starting to create a more formal dev team and you will be a pivotal part of that both in terms of how we operate day to day and who we hire as and when we need to grow.M7 Real Estate is a company of 30 people, led by a partnership of 11.  Most of the partnership has worked together over 3 different businesses over the course of the last 15 years.  We are a close team that finds the right people and then hangs on to them.  We are in the process of opening offices in Glasgow, Amsterdam and Denmark and Germany is forecast for later in the year.

      Guys, please be aware that this is indeed for Booking.com. This company treats its developers like dogs.Please read the links below before applying to the companyhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5803798https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5923178http://blogs.perl.org/users/bookingemployee/2012/03/truth-ab...Can the moderator please stop recruiters from posting on this forum.
                      
                  
      A bunch of "single post" accounts all designed to attack one company? Add in someone impersonating brian d foy, a well known Perl dev (and you use almost exactly the same wording) and it really looks like you're a disgruntled ex-employee who's out to hurt this company.
                      
                  
      @Curtis (Ovid) Poe: I am not going to make an ad hominem retort directed at you as I am aware of your contribution to Perl and also that you are legally bound by Booking.com not to speak ill about them.All that I am saying is, there are a lot of ways of making money and it isn't correct to put your reputation at stake to advertise a tainted company such as Booking.com for a couple of thousand euros.The frequent advertisement for developers is not only due to the exodus of senior devs (including you) from the company but also because booking is trying to create a redundant pool of devs so that the business doesn't get effected by this employee churn.If an employee complains he/she is asked to leave the company and all that is because they have a huge cash reserve built out of years of underpaying developers and exploiting hotels.Years of copy paste has made the code unmaintainable and I am not talking about the new code Aevar and you had written for Booking::Search but Booking::Maxotel, Availability, Policy system, Search::Which, Search::When, etc.
I have never seen a company which rebukes its developers for refactoring or treat its developers like dogs except at Booking.As they have a real bad reputation in the Perl community they are trying to get developers from other communities who are ignorant.Booking.com not only mistreats its developers they also bully the hotels using their monopoly.Successful lawsuits have been filed against the company for price fixing as can be googled.Only if a dev is unemployed should he consider working for Booking.com. There are a lot of good companies and they are actively seeking employees including here in the UK.
                      
                  
      Who downvoted this? And why?
                      
                  
      He doesn't actually say who is hiring because it's an agency and has posted multiple times to the thread.Not what we want on here at all. The Who is mightily important and he won't say.It's an abuse of this thread.
                      
                  
      If you take a look at the ads, instead of skimming them, you'll see each ad is for a different company in a different city. So it makes sense to have multiple posts and it is in no way spamming.Just consider a single post saying "Hey, we have several positions in several places in the world", that does not convey any information.They are trying to be helpful and you're replying with "screw it, they're recruiters".Disclaimer: I use their services. They are in no way a shitty recruiter service and in the first e-mail exchange they say which is the company.
                      
                  
      I certainly didn't but it was more than likely because they are a recruitment company - http://www.allaroundtheworld.fr/who-we-are.html
                      
                  
      Yup, we're a recruitment company (amongst other things).  However, we're very specialized. We focus on international IT recruiting where companies are willing to sponsor you for a work permit (or the local equivalent). This is because my wife and I are both serial expats and we believe that people should be able to live anywhere in the world they want (we're not saying it's practical, but it's still our dream).Thus, since we have a lot of background in this area, I'm moderately well-known in the IT world and I keep getting companies contacting me to help them find people (because of my "how to become an expat" blog http://www.overseas-exile.com/), we decided that we'd create a company to help people live their dreams.We're proud of the fact that we help people move to other countries. We're particularly happy with one young developer who escaped a violence-filled, high unemployment country. Of course, since we're "just recruiters", we're stereotyped and there's no easy way to shake that, but I'm proud of the work we do.
                      
                  
      Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm certainly not saying you deserved to be downvoted. I'm an ex-agency recruiter and I know better than most how much hate recruiters get on HN - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2753958I was simply shedding some light on why I think people are downvoting you.
                      
                  
      That's a fair point and a very enlightening post. Thanks for sharing it :)So far we've not really gotten much direct hate from folks, but it happens from time to time. I suspect the fact that we're trying to help people move to other countries might make us look a bit nicer, but it's tough to say.
                      
                  
      My first guess is that the downvoter(s) think this is for booking.com...I initially did (but I didn't downvote, because on second look, it isn't clear).There are a lot of bad stories about working at booking.com...one of those things you don't even know how you know, but you realize it must get brought up a lot for that association (and only that association) to exist with the company.edit: now I did downvote it for posting a duplicate where a simple list of countries would have sufficed.
                      
                  
      > edit: now I did downvote it for posting a duplicate where a simple list of countries would have sufficed.Um, uh, er. Yeah, you're right, darn it. I didn't think about that (duh), but in retrospect, it should have been obvious to me :(I won't make that mistake again. Thanks for pointing it out!
