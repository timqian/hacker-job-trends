Matasano - New York City, Chicago, San Francisco Bay AreaWe break into banks. And hospitals. And financial firms. And social media startups. And any other business that puts an open port between itself and the big bad world.Matasano is looking for appsec consultants, now and forever. What does that mean?We dig deep. Our consultants spend their days sliding up and down the ladder of abstraction, rapidly assimilating unfamiliar systems (and then breaking them). One week you're pulling apart macros in a Lisp app; the next, you're on your hands and knees crawling through x86 disassembly.We move fast. Our projects run on tight deadlines: one or two weeks is typical. Recently we wrote a bespoke proxy to rip apart a custom encrypted protocol, tamper with messages, and cobble it back together again. That could be a two-week job in itself. At Matasano, that's just Tuesday.We find bugs. Not just in applications, but in the tools they're built with. That includes some of the biggest open-source and proprietary software stacks in the world.This is the Mission: Impossible of software gigs, and we need the best people to get the job done. NO PRIOR APPSEC EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We need great software developers and fast learners, for we intend to go in harm's way. If this sounds interesting to you, we should absolutely talk.Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of software applications?Matasano knows.Full benefits. Free books. Really smart coworkers. For more information, visit http://www.matasano.com/careers.Looking for a taste of what we do? Shoot an email to cryptopals@matasano.com. We'll get you started with 48 problems (and counting) of real-world cryptography problems. This is the best answer you will ever get to the question: "Why shouldn't I roll my own crypto?"
                      
                  
      Note to employers: this is how a job posting should read. Sufficient detail, makes you want to work for them, scares you into sending your resume, then is soft and sweet with the benefits. And the humor is an added bonus. I read this in the movie narrator voice, "In a world...."
                      
                  
      I don't have quite such a way with words, but Matasano is awesome. It's also worth noting that they take interns (full disclosure: me, twice) and yes- you will do those things, for real, immediately. Don't know how? Ask and prepare to learn.I say to all of you who like to break things: talk to them.
                      
                  
      Whoah.
                      
                  
      explain? curious why the founder of Matasano is surprised...
                      
                  
      I did not see that job posting coming.
                      
                  
      do you really use lisp on a /(semi)?regular/ basis?!
                      
                  
      I wouldn't say we use lisp. We do test lisp apps every so often.
                      
                  
      No, he's just messing with you. It's mostly SML.
                      
                  
      Hmm. What about haskell, or, going in a completely different direction, assembler?Also, why sml over lisp?
                      
                  
      I think Tom is messing with you on that one.Full disclosure: ex-Matasano here, and die-hard lisp dude.If somebody writes it, they will figure out how to rip it apart. Bank on it.
                      
                  
      SpaceX - Hawthorne, CA (LA area).Want to help build rockets? SpaceX is looking for software engineers! If you want to build something tangible: large machines that make fire and go to space, as opposed to the latest "social app", SpaceX is a great opportunity. Here, real things happen:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoxiK7K28PUhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqCELhkXtsYSome of the openings we have are for: flight software, simulations software, and front end engineers. See our career page: http://www.spacex.com/careers.phpEdit: We don't do remote, and you need to be a US citizen or permanent resident.
                      
                  
      Would love to work here (PhD in CS) but I don't have a greencard :(
                      
                  
      I just applied for the Avionics (Software) team. I'm still a college student, so I applied for Internship/Co-op. Looking forward to hearing back from you guys!
                      
                  
      Any possibility of the relaxing the US citizen requirement in the future?
                      
                  
      I really don't think it's up to them unfortunately. As a non-US student looking to apply for one of their internships, I was burned by that too. The regulation in question is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_R...
                      
                  
      In that article under "Exemptions and Treaties" [1], it says that Canada is exempt. Does that mean Canadians can work at SpaceX?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_...
                      
                  
      I remember mentioning that I'm a Canadian student to whomever I spoke on the phone with from SpaceX, and they said no, but I don't know if they knew about this exemption, or if SpaceX is just generally very broad in this regard to make things easier.
                      
                  
      I think what is being discussed is a TN Visa for Canadian citizens. Generally, it is very easy for any Canadian to come work in the U.S. as they just need to go to the boarder to have some paperwork signed off for their TN Visa. But, the problem with SpaceX is that we have to follow ITAR Regulations and can only employ permanent residents (U.S. Citizens and Green Card Holders).  TN Visa Holders unfortunately do not fall within either of those groups. If anyone is interested in working at SpaceX, then definitely apply or contact me. Cheers!
                      
                  
      Not that I'm aware of.
                      
                  
      Unlikely, it originates in the US government export control laws. (Turns out rocket technology can be used for nefarious purposes...)
                      
                  
      I watched an interview with Elon Musk last night where he was discussing his due diligence before starting SpaceX. He went to Russia to see what it would cost to buy an ICBM from them (without the nuke). They thought he was crazy but knew he was also crazy rich so the Russians took the meeting. The funny (funny scary not ha-ha) part was that, as the discussions continued, the Russians intimated that they were open to selling the nuke as well as the rocket.
                      
                  
      i think the annecdote was something like "he approached NASA and they said it was unthinkable. Then he approached the Russian agency, and they said it would be very expensive" so he started to talk with the Russians. I never heard the nuke thing, so i'd be interested if you can find as well.here's the negotiating part: http://www.esquire.com/features/americans-2012/elon-musk-int..."""
He was ready to buy three Russian ICBMs for $21 million when the Russians told him that no, they meant $21 million for one. "They taunted him," Cantrell says. "They said, 'Oh, little boy, you don't have the money?' I said, 'Well, that's that.' I was sitting behind him on the flight back to London when he looked at me over the seat and said, 'I think we can build a rocket ourselves.'"
"""
                      
                  
      Do you have a link to that interview?

We even have a seaside beach here in landlocked Vienna, an amenity which Berlin is lacking.More seriously, the app looks great and produces some impressive analysis (if that's what the job is connected to).
                      
                  
      I sent you an email last month, applying for the lead iOS engineer, but no one replied. Are you still hiring for that position? Alternatively, would you consider a candidate without node.js experience?
                      
                  
      you had a month to learn it, what's stopping you! :)

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team of software craftsmen (10 of us right now) passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we're more concerned with using the 
    right tool for the job. In the past two months, I've worked with Objective-C,
    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives, activities, 
    and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are rare by design.
  
  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, 
    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with
    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, and less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in the
    Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - Affordable housing. If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the 
    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought 
    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my 
    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of startups. 
    The energy here around the growth in technology and the support for entrepreneurs 
    is infectious.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why youâ€™re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com
                      
                  
      7 out of 9 people in your team wear glasses. Why? I don't know a percentage but isn't that really skewed?
                      
                  
      It's actually higher than thatâ€¦Ross is wearing glasses right now, but he doesn't have them on in his picture.We also have a new hire who isn't on the site yet who wears glasses.
                      
                  
      I guess people better wear glasses to the interview ;)
                      
                  
      And be a white male.
                      
                  
      Are you guys looking for people to work from home, or only considering people who will relocate?
                      
                  
      We are believers in the value of cross-functional, co-located teams. We've tried remote workers in the past and discovered that it doesn't really work for us.
                      
                  
      In a consulting business, the typical way you make money is by selling time. A friend of mine has called this "Slavery to the Tyranny of the Billable Hour". The way to scale is by acquiring more time (aka more employees available to work for more hours) so you can bill more hours. It's ok for some, but diversification is better.We've discovered that whenever you get a bunch of smart folk together who are passionate about what they do, other avenues open up. In our case, we've start forming teams around different business models and product ideas that attract us. These models and ideas are then selectively sponsored by the consultancy to go forward, develop something and release it to the world. The hope is that these new products and businesses would become a source of income for the whole team. As those products and new businesses scale, the consulting business profits, thus scaling through alternate means.Full disclosure: I work with EJ at Mutually Human.
                      
                  
      I'm not sure exactly what you mean. There are certainly larger companies than Mutually Human. If one wanted to work for a large company, I'm sure many will post in this threadâ€¦ :)However...- I'm learning new things all the time, at a faster pace than anywhere else I've worked. The company is very focused on everyone's growth.- I actually have time for my family, personal projects, friends, etc, as we really do keep our hours reasonable.- We have happy clients who love our work and are willing to pay well for it.
                      
                  
      MH seems like a great place to work. I want to congratulate the founders on the culture they put in place. If I was brave enough to switch jobs, this would be the type of place near the top of my list.
                      
                  
      Oh, sorry, I didn't mean the company size. Under scaling I meant "write once, sell million times", "have million clients", etc...
                      
                  
      I work at MHS also, and FWIW we have created products in the past and also have a couple new products in the pipeline. We will probably never be a pure products company - but we think crafting our own products a really great way for us to flex our creative muscles and learn new things.
                      
                  
      why is this relevant?  [edit: fwiw, the question so obviously has the answer "no" (for hn-related values of "scale") that it doesn't seem to be an honest enquiry at all, but an attempt to make a point (for some hn-related value of "point").]
                      
                  
      It might not be relevant in this particular thread. I was genuinely interested in the point of view of the person who is running such business.EDIT: I see, but I guess I'm not that much HNer to agree with you. Anyway, I got quite interesting answers (including yours).
                      
                  
      Ahhâ€¦I don't run the business. In fact, I'm a pretty recent hire.From where I sit, it's clearly a different beast from where I've worked before (BigCo and a YC startup). We're probably not going to get rich or have a million-user product, but I wasn't ever chasing that anyways.

      Austin, TX (On-Site or Remote with Occasional On-Site)Ember Endeavour for the EffervescentMyTennisLessons.comA bootstrapped company with over $100K in revenue (and now a part of the Austin Capital Factory accelerator). One awesome startup house in Austin, TX. A boxer-pug puppy named Heidi Klum. And an awesome team of six friends and colleagues.We run a marketplace where students can purchase lessons online or over the phone with a nationwide network of tennis instructors. SEO is our game and over 75% of our customers come from organic traffic. Why tennis? Our founders met on the University of Connecticut tennis team and have been instructors themselves. We ran the business manually and with thousands of static pages for a whole year while teaching ourselves to code and eventually adding another rails developer to the team.Summer nears and our application has come a long way. It works. But we want it to do more than work. We want it to provide an amazing experience, for our students, for our instructors, and for ourselves as we continue to build, test, and iterate. We want an Ember App.Hereâ€™s some reasons why:
-We sell lessons for individuals or groups of 2-6 in pre-set â€˜lesson packagesâ€™, each with their own per-lesson-price. Which should be displayed as the student chooses their options. With one line of code.
-Our existing tennis court location manager and schedule availability features are just calling to be Emberified
-Happiness is a readable code base
-Page loads are for suckas
-And moreThink you can help get us there? Let us know. Weâ€™re a laid back group that enjoys working hard and generating value. Ideally weâ€™d like to find another team member with some experience and looking to explore a new adventure. If youâ€™re interested, send an e-mail introducing yourself and providing some links to code samples/contributions to michael@mytennislessons.com.P.S. And yes, we know thereâ€™s other types of fitness professionals out there who could use a similar service. Coming soon to a website near you ; )
                      
                  
      HealthPost - Houston, TX - openings in both dev & salesIn the past I've gone into more details, but I'm going to make this short and sweet. We have 7 people. We're deploying to hospitals in 4 time zones and growing rapidly. We value creative people who will help dream up new products for our platform.  We're pretty flexible, but at least at the beginning you need to be comfortable spending a higher amount of face-to-face time in our office.Ruby on Rails DeveloperAt the moment, we want experienced web application developers who can point us to relevant accomplishments and will be happy to show us their abilities with a test project. We prefer friendly folks who are quick to ask questions and help each other out. We need self-starters who would enjoy the opportunity to brainstorm new ideas for our products and look forward to the opportunity to interact with customers.Experienced Healthcare SalespersonIf you are an excellent salesperson highly experienced in sales to hospitals, this will be an outstanding opportunity for you. Customers are coming to us and we have had to do very little in sales. Our potential pipeline is huge and you could make a huge impact on our expansion.  We need someone who already knows what matters to the various stakeholders in each hospital and can capably explain how our products are a win for all of them. A talented engineering team is expanding the cloud-based software platform and also ready to tackle any new ideas you bring us.

The important part is that we have a lot of fun building and owning distributed systems and are looking for engineers who can come in and push their first feature to production within a few days of starting and who can also help us get that duration down to hours.  The stack is primarily azure/.net/C#, although there is some node.js in the house and when we do UIs we don't use biggish server-side stacks.  But when we do server-side systems we run them on 1000s of instances and support 10^5 req/sec all day, every day.The key is that we own our own systems and hence our destiny.  You can't ask for anything more than that.You can contact me at f00biebletch at gmail (quicker) or you can go through the official posting (slower): https://careers.microsoft.com/jobdetails.aspx?ss=&pg=0&#...
                      
                  
      I think Skype (now Microsoft) should be the primary example for others, to show that REMOTE employment should be pervasive these days.

      Interesting. May I ask you - did you get a lot of emails from otherwise experienced candidates (e.g. 8+ years C++, etc...), or maybe the noise comes from the people who plan their first language to be Go?Thanks
                      
                  
      Both. This ad works better than any other ad in this thread. :)
                      
                  
      So it was your intention to get an attention of such a wide audience. I mean, some other posts here try to narrow the potential candidates pool.In case you're interested - one of the main reason I didn't apply - I got an impression that this company can't provide a silicon valley level comparable compensations for senior engineers (I fall into "otherwise experienced" group). I might be wrong though...

      I'm a RoR developer working at a company in the Bay Area called Coupa Software. We're a provider of e-procurement software, which is enterprisey stuff that helps large companies manage their internal spending. Tech reporters often describe us as "Mint.com for businesses" but that's only a small part of what we do.We generally target lots of very enterprisey customers, but we're still pretty small and not-corporate. At the moment the dev team (including PMs, UX, etc) is about 20 people. I like to think we're at a pretty good balance between startup and big company.We're currently hiring "Ruby on Rails Developer, Integrations Engineer, Front End Developer, UX Designer, Visual Designer", but imho we're mostly in need of full stack devs. This company is growing very very very quickly, and flexible developers who can wear many hats are the best for thatWe're in downtown San Mateo, 1 block from Caltrain. REMOTES, H1Bs, TNs (I am one! from Canada eh?) are all ok. Competitive pay, 401k, health insurance. WFH privileges, flex time, all that good stuff. An unlimited PTO system.  And as a personal anecdote: I've experienced almost no overtime here, and virtually no pressure to overwork myself. Coupa respects a healthy work-life balance.  There's a lot of room for self-management here; work the way you work best, show results, and you'll be given the freedom to do it however you like.If anyone is interested, mail me at tim.herd @ coupa.com, paste your resume, github link, maybe a cover letter if you're feeling generous :D. If you're experienced with Rails (or someone who can get up to speed with minimal training), we'd love to have you.

You are self-aware, self-motivated, and self-disciplined. If you were a robot you would be a sentient robotâ€¦ aware of your own robot-ness.

You see everyone you meet as someone you can learn from. Except for those silver painted street performers. They have nothing for you.

      So, uh, I'm looking for an entry-level sysadmin/data-center monkey.  You could call this an intern type position, but I don't care if you are in school or not.Prgmr.com rents virtual private servers, dedicated servers, and datacenter space.  Right now, we have 3 full-time folks, counting me, and two part-timers but I'm the only hardware person, and only two of us are local.So, there are several catches.  the first?  I can't afford a full time person for at least two months.   If you are willing to show up and work between then and now?  $15/hr on a 1099.  After those two months (and after I'm done paying for twice the co-lo I need)  we can talk about going full time W2.  (prgmr.com pays for Kaiser, if you are full-time)Now, I do have an arrangement with a local refurbished server and network hardware dealer;  I give him a good entry level person, he'll hire them full time with health insurance and stuff (for a little more than I'm paying;  not a lot more, this is definitely still entry-level pay.)  and he'll rent you back to me on a per-day basis at a discount (sort of as a referral bonus to me.)   - so that's one way you can make this full-time before I stabilize prgmr.com.   Note, he's based out of mountain view, and I'm in Santa Clara and all of this is very much hands-on work.So yeah, what I need is someone I can teach how to handle my layer-1.   I need my shit wired up, I need it wired up neatly (I can train you in cable lacing, but the neater you are, the better.)   I need all my ports labeled inside my network gear (I can show you how to do this; Serial ain't rocket science.)  and inside my PDUs.This would be pretty good for someone studying up on their CCNA or something;  I probably have obsolete hardware I could give you for your lab, too.I need someone I can train up to set up my IPMI out of band access.  Again, I can train, it's not hard.    Again, experience using the command line helps a lot.I also need someone who can handle racking/stacking servers, dragging servers to the car and back.  You need to be able to safely lift 50lbs, (and more importantly, you need to ask for help when you /can't/ lift safely.  pester the security guys;  they will usually help, and if not, call me.)  and you need transportation that can handle 50lb servers.  (meh, if you have transportation, we can probably work something out with the hauling.  I've got an old van I loan people.)You need to be able to handle ssh, and ssh with public key authentication with minimal help from me.So, the way I usually do this is that people email me, we go back and forth a few times (I won't hire you if you can't communicate via email... sorry, just one of my things.)  then next time I need help I call you up.   You show up and work.  I pay you (check, but if you want we can drop by the bank and get it cashed for you same day... just when I pay cash the accountant gets mad at me)   If you do well and I need help again, i call you back;   At these rates, (and especially with this (lack of) stability) it's not fair to expect you to interview for free.So yeah.  Entry level.    If you seem teachable, I don't care if you are currently unemployed.I demand honesty, but not loyalty;  by that, I mean I'm realistic. I'm not going to be angry if you move on to a better paying job quickly.Especially at first, while we're just doing 'as needed' gigs?  I'm understanding about your schedule;  I don't demand you drop everything for me.  (Once you go full time, we'll have to talk more about this.   I do eventually want someone besides me to be hardware on-call, but I understand that needs to be worth your time, and this offer probably is probably not good enough to get you to let me drag your ass out of bed at 2am.)
                      
                  
      It is refreshing to see posts like this that are willing to teach. Wish I could do it. Have a good one, and good luck filing the position.
                      
                  
      well, it's a trade-off with the money, usually.    That, and ISPs/hosting companies have traditionally been good places for entry-level folk.  There is a strong culture or tradition of mentorship, or at least, of hiring likely looking folk and letting them run systems above their pay grade.  (and to be clear, this will be a lot of that, too;  I mean, I don't expect you to know this stuff off the bat, and I expect some questions, but I also expect a certain level of ability to, you know, look it up and figure it out.)Locally? I hear that he.net also hires new people and trains; they even have a semi-formal training program.  Some of it is public, too. Check out their IPv6 certification.[1]  - but from what I hear, they have a lot more of that sort of thing internally.   They took my last PFY;  I likely would have been able to keep her if I had extended a full-time offer sooner, as they didn't offer great money, but like I said, I've got two more months of being financially very uncomfortable.[1]http://ipv6.he.net/certification/
                      
                  
      I really enjoy how this is written, and while I'm not your guy here, I'd love to have a job with someone who writes this job post.
                      
                  
      Also, if there are any would-be customers looking for hosting, I can personally vouch that dealing with lsc via support is exactly as pleasant as this job posting is, even if you're really not supposed to need support. o.O
                      
                  
      How would you feel about employing a minor?
                      
                  
      a little bit afraid?  I'd probably have to look at the legal implications, but it's not right out, if that is what you are asking.   I mean, it might be completely out on the support side of things;  I don't go after 'adult content' but I don't actively prohibit it, (other than through having 2008-level bandwidth quotas, which actually dissuades pretty strongly)  and even if I did, it would still pop up occasionally.but even so, on the hardware side of things, you won't see any of that (and I do go through pains to avoid looking at my customer's stuff anyhow.) and certainly, for what I'm paying... meh.But yeah.  I'd need to talk with a lawyer, and I'd probably want to talk with the parents and have them see what I'm doing first (as I assume that's where problems would come from if there were problems.)
                      
                  
      I'd be interested in the position. Current CS major but wouldn't mind taking a plunge!

      Baxter Planning Systems - http://www.bybaxter.com/careers/ - Austin, TX - FULLTIME LOCALHave you ever wondered where parts originate to repair your air conditioner, the ATM at your bank, or the MRI machine in your local hospital? To reduce downtime, companies depend on a global supply chain of warehouses, delivery services, and manufacturers to supply the service parts to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world. Baxter Planning Systems is seeking outstanding Java Developers to optimize and automate every facet of this service parts supply chain.Baxter Planning Systems offers a unique environment combining the flexibility of a startup with the stability of an established company. Our developers are involved in the entire product lifecycle, from problem description to design and execution. 20 years of established business with numerous satisfied customers provides ongoing revenue that isolates us from the anxiety of funding cycles or the constant search for the next big deal.Working closely with on-staff domain experts, our developers have the opportunity to learn about the complexities of global supply chain management, and offer their own solutions to the challenges it presents. Challenges like planning optimal stocking levels for tens of thousands of parts distributed across thousands of locations worldwide, combined with complex interdependencies due to substitutability, regulatory issues, and the need to minimize both downtime and cost.The ideal candidate for Baxter is a smart developer who gets things done by applying technology, especially open source, to meet our goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The development and QA teams work closely with key stakeholders to formulate and manage development timelines that are both realistic and produce high-quality application features. You won't have to start from scratch either: we have a great infrastructure of automated unit/integration/regression/UI tests, automated builds, virtualized test environments, and a solid technology stack. But we recognize there's always room for improvement and welcome the experience and expertise you'd bring in improving our development practices, tools, and execution.Regretfully at this time we are unable to accommodate 3rd party placement agencies, H-1B sponsorships,  long-term telecommuting, or relocation. Please submit your resume and salary requirements to devjobs@bybaxter.com.

      Rollbar (https://rollbar.com) - San Francisco (SOMA)We're hiring a back-end engineer to be employee #2. You'll own the reliability, performance, and scalability of our systems, spending about half your time on infrastructure automation/maintenance and the other half building and improving back-end systems.Our tech stack currently includes Python, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcache, and Beanstalkd; plus Nagios for monitoring and Fabric for automation.One key challenge we're having is ensuring uptime in the face of datacenter-level issues (we've had some) -- our customers rely on us to tell them when they're having problems, so we really need to be rock solid, at least on our API and data processing tiers. So far we're in 6 datacenters with DNS failover and a few other techniques, but there's much much more to do.If this sounds interesting, email brian@rollbar.com and let's find a time to talk or meet up.
