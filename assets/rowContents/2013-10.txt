      Nirav, could you please reply to an email? At least when it is from a HN user. Thanks.EDIT: I sent an email more than a month ago. Second one two weeks ago. No reply. So what's the problem? (asking to downvoters)
                      
                  
      I'm not going to downvote, but I feel like your request for a response could have been handled better. Your comment sounds too hostile (to me).I think you will get better reception if you approach the situation without assuming the worst. (e.g. "I think my emails may not be getting through/trapped in the SPAM folder/are being missed" vs. "You are purposefully ignoring me")Good luck.
                      
                  
      Sorry, replied via email.  We don't have a full time recruiter or HR person (it's a position on our careers page), so replying to each application in a personal manner is time taken out of engineering at the moment.
                      
                  
      so to be clear, you're soliciting applications, including on HN.  People are spending their time to create cover letter / resume / send an email.  And you can't be arsed to reply to that email.  Got it.
                      
                  
      Your request is 100% legitimate. People put a lot of time and effort into applying to jobs. Not answering for a month is just not acceptable. Even a reply that says "We're still reviewing your application" is good enough. 
I hear from friends this happens in companies which have the resources and people and that's just shows the real company culture, the one not mentioned in the careers pages.

      Nairobi, Kenyahttp://kili.io--Launching public cloud to the African continent using OpenStack.  Amazon Web Services won't come here so we're building it right now.The company is in the seed stage but you'll be working with me (former NY startup CTO), this guy James (awesome local DevOps person), and another guy Anthony (Princeton grad with a finance background).We're just getting started but have a server up already and will be launching to the beta list later this week.I can pay for a plane ticket and a small salary but this won't be about big monthly dollars - rather it will be about doing something super cool in a place that's super cool and where on the weekend you can literally drive out of the city and camp where you hear hippos at night and see lions during the day and hike an extinct volcano.Oh, and you'll also become part of an amazing tech community that's thinking big.Contact me at adam@kili.io if you're interested in doing 2 months or more or if you just want to find out what it's all about.Cheers,Adam--"Go where there's growth" - Eric Schmidt

      Yes, that's exactly what happened.
                      
                  
      Oh, quite right.  Apologies; I saw 'theresumator' and thought it was an affiliate link.Thanks.

      Don't take it personal, it just false-positived on "competitive salaries"https://github.com/rowanmanning/joblint/blob/master/lib/rule...clearly joblint needs some tuning, maybe a negative match if the term "competitive" is followed by the term [salar[y|ies]|compensation].
                      
                  
      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside 
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.
  
  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit 
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why youâ€™re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com
                      
                  
      heh... looks like it's output a notice about competitiveness and tallied a "realism fail" point because of the terms "TOP-floor" and saying that Founders is a "TOP 15" brewery.  https://github.com/rowanmanning/joblint/blob/master/lib/rule...I guess those bars are pretty low tho.  /me complains but doesn't send pull request.  oh well none of us is perfect :)
                      
                  
      This sounds like a pretty nice work environment.
                      
                  
      Seed Equity - San FranciscoInternational startups struggle to raise funding and grow because they lack access to venture capital. Seed Equity is on a mission to help these startups get off the ground by providing them the power of equity crowdfunding. We believe the best entrepreneurs in the world should be funded no matter where they are, and due to recent legislation and new technology, this vision is becoming a reality. Help us empower the startups outside of Silicon Valley.Tech Stack -> The same tech stack used by StackOverflow: C#, ASP.NET MVC4, AngularJS, SQL Server. Feels like Rails, but scales like crazy. (Amazing fact: the entire StackExchange network runs on 12 web servers, 2 database servers, 2 caching servers, and 2 load-balancing servers. See: http://bit.ly/vihD5R.)Challenges -> Highly scalable web services. A secure storage system for sensitive financial data that rests on top of cloud storage services.Team -> 2 engineers in SF, 3 business operators in Salt Lake City. The business executive team founded and ran InterbankFX, which had customers in over 100 countries and was one of the top 5 forex firms in the US before it was acquired a few years ago. We're fully funded due to that acquisition.Benefits -> $90k - $105k, 0.3% - 0.5% equity, health/dental/vision insurance, 401kOur site (currently in private beta): https://seedequity.com

      San Francisco, CA - Zenbox. Software Engineer. [LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]We're a YC company wrangling SaaS to work together (as they should), starting by bringing the biggest apps our customers use right into Gmail. We've been growing our team over the past few months, and looking to add even more awesome people.
We work with dozens of API's to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw available when helping customers.Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there's still so much polish and improvement possible.We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we've recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it's interesting.Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers. We're building a team that's able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.This is both UI and backend work.Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript.

      VERBA - San Francisco* Rails/JS Product Focus - HALF-TIME with benefits* Rails/JS Product Focus - FULL-TIME* Product/Infrastructure Reliability/Performance Focus - HALF-TIME with benefitsI mentioned a couple months ago that we have a couple engineers who work half-time-ish (and do their own things the rest of the time) and it got some positive feedback: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235860We're looking to hire a couple more engineers who are interested in being part of a team but would prefer to work 24-40 hours per week instead of the usual 50+. We're also looking to hire someone full-time (40ish hours per week). If this sounds interesting let me know (ragalie@verbasoftware.com)=========About us:
The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps colleges and universities transform themselves so that they a) embrace the power of transparency and the internet, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make approximately the same profit margin from course material sales.About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore's offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.We're looking for people familiar with some of Ruby, Rails, Clojure, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we're moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix's Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end. Additional pluses are a stats background, experience with Hadoop and knowledge of scheduling algorithms.You can check out our website (http://www.verbasoftware.com) to read about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)

      If that's a full-time gig, that pay is insulting for an experienced front-end developer. I am getting paid over twice that (yes, after the conversion) as a junior front-end dev. I don't have a degree or any significant work experience and live in Boston which I imagine has a marginally lower cost of living. I realize you probably aren't the person who sets that price but it just needed to be said - you will certainly not find the right person if your not willing to pay them appropriately.
                      
                  
      To be fair, that's about right for the UK market. Mid-range developer posts across the nation pay 30k, possibly a little higher in London.It's low compared to the US, sure.
                      
                  
      Some mid range UK developer posts pay that across the UK, but there are plenty out there that quickly pay more. London should be paying at least Â£6k more than that just for cost of living.
London is where developers go to earn the "kick" to their salary that they can then move to the sticks on.More important is that the pay progression is like, given the difficulty in firing people in the UK compared to the US you often find pay ramps up quickly.

      Ambition | Chattanooga, TN | Full TimeAmbition is essentially "Fantasy Football for Sales Organizations" where managers can choose/weight metrics for employee-based teams to compete over across seasons. Increases employee productivity through competition and employer efficiency through automation. Demo is available here: http://tryambition.comWhile we haven't officially launched (no time for marketing website and we still need to automate several processes) we are signing up customers, generating revenue, and currently have more organizations on our waiting list than we have integrated. We are a twelve person team and could easily put 5 engineers to work tomorrow. Python/Django devs, AWS sysadmins, C# devs, web devs needed.Contact me at travis.truett@ambition.io if you are interested and would like to learn more. This is my third start-up experience and easily the most promising/exciting...
                      
                  
      seems like an interesting venture.
                      
                  
      Thanks, I'm glad you think so. While we still have a tremendous amount of work to do automating our customer integration process we are very excited about what's next.We see the future of Ambition being comparable to New Relic except where they focus on servers we focus on humans. We are already gaining significant market share in the transportation industry (3PL brokerages) and one of our goals is to provide anonymized indices and benchmarks across job functions, geographic locations, and seniority. In addition we are building in customizable triggers where managers can set notifications based on employee/team behavior and momentum. Less time in excel looking at yesterday's data, more time on the floor.Overall, it's our belief that the majority of people spend the majority of their waking lives at work with the majority of their emotions ranging from apathy to misery... if we can incrementally make work more fun/engaging/inspiring than we've done our good deed, fortunately our "Fantasy Football" system seems to be doing just that.

Looking for a frontend designer.We make an analytics and visualization platform for natural language text.Luminoso can quantify the things you're looking for in a text dataset, and also lets you explore to find the things you didn't know you were looking for. It learns from text in your domain, but it doesn't have to learn from scratch: it starts out knowing what words mean, in many languages, based on ConceptNet (http://conceptnet.media.mit.edu).As a frontend designer, you'd help us with visual design and user experience, to make it easy for people to upload their text data and get insights from it. This position focuses on design but interacts with the frontend code, so you should be interested in learning (or already know) CoffeeScript and knockout.js.

      SpaceX - Los Angeles, CA
http://www.spacex.com/careersWe seek to accelerate the course of human history by developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization.We build rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, utilizing much of our own electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldnâ€™t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.When considering you as a candidate, we wonâ€™t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that youâ€™re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that youâ€™re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. Youâ€™re the engineer that other engineers can count onâ€”youâ€™re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the teamâ€™s passionate dedication to the mission.At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and â€œlaunchingâ€� the product will be like no other product launch youâ€™ve ever experienced!Note for new or recent graduates: If youâ€™re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!
                      
                  
      If you'd like to apply to SpaceX go through another recruiter. I applied through Ryan a while back. He was unprofessional and kept getting mixed up with the schedule. In the end I did 6+ hours of phone interviews and a 4 hour coding test. I sent in my results and was completely ignored. No feedback, no response to my inquiries. Honestly one of the most insulting things that's ever happed to me.Go on Linkedin, SpaceX has several other recruiters available.
                      
                  
      Hi Ninjay,My apologies for not getting back to you and your candidate experience. This is deeply regrettable and something I would like to apologize for over the phone. Can you please e-mail me when you have a chance? I would like to get more information if possible so I can figure out where I dropped the ball.Sincerely,
Ryan

      Can a non-citizen apply?
                      
                  
      I was so eager to apply to spacex and so disappointed when I saw the residence requirements. I hope this changes in future
                      
                  
      I know right? I guess "interplanetary" still mean only US citizens even if you are highly qualified.
                      
                  
      Yeah, I'm interested as well. Since they are "developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization", why should the position be limited to one particular country on one particular planet...
                      
                  
      US Government arms control laws make it very difficult to hire people who are not at least US permanent residents.

      Thanks for adding remote status. Everybody here is supposed to do that, but few do.
                      
                  
      Actually, they should add R-MOTE only if it's true.  If everyone puts "r-mote" or "no r-mote" then ctrl-f "r-mote" is useless.Edited to not exacerbate the problem
                      
                  
      In my experience, when NO R-MOTE is not mentioned explicitly, it usually means that it is negotiable.

Think HTTP/DB/memcache/NAS/etc processing times for all the servers in a datacenter, all by passively watching the network.I'm a software engineer at ExtraHop and here's why I love my job:1. The team is amazing and everyone makes a difference. The two founders, Jesse and Raja, designed and built BigIP v9 when they were at F5 Networks before founding ExtraHop, and are still very much involved in engineering. It's a great working environment and we have a lot of fun.2. Hard problems at all levels. We parse a bunch of different protocols at 20Gbps by writing high-performance multithreaded C and our own linux kernel drivers. Our datastore handles 200,000 inserts a second with 10MB/s of data. Our UI has a ton of charts and tables, with data going through django and tornado. We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers. You can hack anything from C to the front-end design and anywhere in between.3. Our customers love it.

      Fetchnotes - Cambridge, MA. Interns and full-time. We make your notes and to do lists better, not just better organized.We have a really simple and effective product for keeping track of reminders, ideas, etc., but what I think is really exciting about our business is the R&D we're doing to automate those things or find relevant context/information.For example, you write down a book you want to look up, and we show you where you can find it. You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items. The possibilities are endless, and there's just as much product strategy that needs to be determined there as there is code. But we believe that productivity software can do so much more than empower the procrastination they do today.Looking to add engineers with experience in mobile development (Android in particular), JavaScript (we use Angular, but experience with another framework like Backbone or Ember will suffice), machine learning and natural language processing. As far as NLP goes, we're doing some really unique things that involve more statistics than typical NLP toolkits, so a good stats background will be helpful.Backed by TechStars Boston and a group of fantastic angel investors and venture capitalists, we're a young, close-knit and energetic team of 6 who believe that simple products, engineered properly, can make a big impact on people's lives. We hang out after work frequently, have dinner together at least weekly, and are genuinely friends (not just co-workers). After big releases, we'll usually take the day off to do something fun like laser tag or kayaking. I believe in hiring people that I want to work with over the course of a career, not just for a particular role today. At the end of every interview I ask myself, "In 10 years, will I regret not having had the opportunity to work with this person?"Also, we were #2 on Hacker News last year when we accidentally called 2,000 people bitches: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813Sound interesting?

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and want to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure.  No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Please visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.

Our test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 2.5% of all births in the United States.The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless. The science is there but the scale isn't. That's where Counsyl comes in. We are building the technology platform to make genomics useful and accessible to everyone.
The vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python/Django/Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing.

      There's something wrong with your website--when I first visit each of the pages, some totally other page appears first.  It has a black or dark grey background with some tabs in a column along the left edge.  It is quickly replaced by the proper site each time, after being visible for perhaps 200ms.  I tried to find a contact address to send this to, but your site makes it really hard to contact you (except via "Live Chat" which I am wary of).  Well, hopefully you find an easy fix.  If it helps, page loads are probably slower than average for me because I'm on the other side of the world.

      Weft - http://weft.io - Boston MA, San Francisco CA, or the surrounding areas  ===========================
  ====== What we do =========
  ===========================

We're Waze for Cargo. Building hardware to put inside of shipping containers so our customers get realtime visibility into their supply chain. We're then taking the info we get from the hardware and figuring out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predicting whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically rerouting/rescheduling shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff.  ===========================
  ===== How we do it ========
  ===========================

Web stack -> clojure (immutant) + HANA (really scary database on crack) -- we use middleman + enlive (and a bit of hiccup) for templatingAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)Hardware -> prototyped with arduino, still using atmel uC but no longer arduino-ey. Manufacture-ready. In the process of sourcing for large scale manufacturing. Have some pilots running.  ===========================
  ====== And the rest =======
  ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies).Looking for help at every point in the system (hardware, firmware, frontend, backend, algorithms, mobile, etc).If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!

      Empirical (ex-MIT PhD/Google, VC-backed) - San Francisco (downtown)- iOS devs (full-time or consulting)- Android devs (full-time or consulting)- Scala devs (consulting)ABOUT US:We're a small shop funded by Floodgate, Greylock, and a few choice angels with a very chill, design-oriented, and highly skilled team.Even though we're all ex-MIT and overly educated, we only care about skill set and your passion -- not your resumÃ©.OUR PRODUCT:We're building a mobile app that will change how we chat/communicate on mobile phones. The vast majority of the Internet including this message is stuck in a paradigm of writing in blank text boxes. This unstructured methodology for communication is pervasive in everything digital and stems from desktops where keyboards make this plausible. On mobile phones, input sucks whether it's typing or speech recognition. Instead, we recognize that many of the types of things we wish text & email are better "app-ified" or "structured," and in doing so we enables lighter-weight communication across individuals & groups with the ability for the phone to intelligently aid in the situation.We're launching within the next few months....Email me at aaron@empiric.al
