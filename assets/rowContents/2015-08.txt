      This is such a cool opportunity. It is totally orthogonal to my skill set, so I won't be personally interested, but so cool: it is rare to see a confluence of "interesting," "philosophically important" and "remote" work outside of pure entrepreneurship.
                      
                  
      This definitely caught my eye. Email sent!

      Hi r_edwards,
I applied to this position but the form was really long, I don't know if I missed a step. Can you send me a mail ? http://www.yrezgui.com/me.html
                      
                  
      RethinkDB - www.rethinkdb.com - Mountain View, CA - C++ hackersWe're making it dramatically easier for the world to shift to realtime apps with a new database access model -- instead of polling the database for changes, the developer can tell RethinkDB to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime.We're hiring C++ engineers to work on performance, the continuous computation engine, and the distributed system.RethinkDB is fun, very technically challenging, well-funded, and is growing very quickly. Intellectually, we're also PL nerds (mostly Lisp and Haskell/ML), so if that's your cup of tea you'll be right at home!
                      
                  
      I'm really curious about database development. What level of experience are you looking for? Are you open to remote work?
                      
                  
      Unfortunately we can't hire remotely.We're not looking for database internals experience at all. We're looking for knowledge of C/C++, algorithms, etc. People tend to learn all things database on the job really fast.
                      
                  
      This sounds tremendously interesting. I'm currently a C++ developer in (one of the big) EDA companies and I'm interested in working in performance and distributed systems. I need a working VISA though. Also, where do I send my resume?
                      
                  
      Hi,I am a Master's student pursuing Computer Science, expecting to graduate in Feb 2016. This position sounds very exciting. Is it still open and would I qualify for this position as a new graduate?-Khushboo
                      
                  
      Sounds brilliant. Overdue change - the paradigm hasn't really moved for 20 years.When will you need help?

      Tweag I/O | Paris, France | ONSITE | Software Engineer (Haskell, C), DevOps Engineer | Scientific computing, Exascale storagehttp://tweag.ioTweag I/O is looking for distributed systems engineers and a devops engineer to join a brand new team starting on a new, fully funded 3 year project in Haskell and in C to develop the next wave of storage solutions, targeted at the Exascale.We are a research and development laboratory at the heart of Europe, applying functional programming techniques to tame the complexity of distributed systems and scale predictably. Most of our existing folks have a PL research and/or formal methods background and enjoy demonstrating the correctness of their solutions with gusto: randomized test case generation, model checking in SPIN/Promela or interactive theorem proving using Coq. We are active maintainers of the Cloud Haskell project and authors of the HaskellR project, among other open source contributions.We are a distributed company with a presence across Europe (and a smidgeon in South America), but for this position we're looking to have you join a local team near our headquarters here in Paris. We're pretty happy to look at helping you relocate if you're up to spending some time in this beautiful city. Fluency in French not required.If you'd love the opportunity and the space to solve the hard problems of science's large dataset infrastructure, by systematically decomposing them into simple, orthogonal solutions that compose and commute like in algebra, shoot us an email at jobs@tweag.io.

      Hi, I'm Dean, the first software engineer at Glowforge. Our software deals with a fair amount of Rails, but we also have Node and Python micro services for certain processes. The UI is very Javascript heavy. We're also writing our own firmware in C. The cloud software is managed with a set of Docker containers.

      Basketball Operations AnalystPhiladelphia 76ers - Philadelphia, PAFull-time/InternThe Philadelphia 76ers are looking to add talented new developers, software engineers, statistical analysts, and data scientists to the team. Basketball analysts will work as a part of the front office and collaborate extensively with the entire basketball operations department including President and GM Sam Hinkie. Experience in basketball is not required; analytical talent and learning easily is. The Sixers are looking for both permanent employees and interns. Most basketball analysts will work in our basketball operations office in Philadelphia but other arrangements may be possible. If you're passionate about basketball and have technical skills that you think could help an NBA team, please see the official posting and apply here: http://nbateamjobs.teamworkonline.com/teamwork/r.cfm?i=71706If you have questions, you can reach us at bballopsjobs@sixers.com.
                      
                  
      This looks like an intriguing opportunity, but I just checked your post history and noticed you have posted the same ad every month for 9 months now.  I can't imagine that a basketball team  is experiencing startup like growth or employs more than a few people in these roles so the repeated ads bring up some questions.  Are you guys actually hiring for open positions or just collection resumes?  Do you have a lot of turnover?  Or is there some other reason (low pay, crazy hours, etc) why this search is taking you the better part of a year?
                      
                  
      I've attempted to contact several times, with no response.
                      
                  
      Hi jsjigg - I'm not sure why that is. Please try again and we'll be sure to get back to you.
                      
                  
      Thanks slg - we are indeed hiring and are just trying to look for as many interested people as we can.If you have specific questions on anything we're happy to answer and would encourage you to send us an email: bballopsjobs@sixers.com.
                      
                  
      It would be nice if you responded to emails.

      Since there's (at the time of this writing) 827 jobs here, I wrote a script you can copy and paste into the web console to search the posts (available here: https://gist.github.com/kristopolous/19260ae54967c2219da8)There is both OR and AND support here.  If you specify your function parameter as an ARRAY then it operates as an AND, otherwise each argument is an OR.For instance, to see posts that are remote and python OR remote and ruby, you can doquery(['remote','python'],['remote','ruby']);The return of the function shows how many jobs were shown versus in total. For instance, as of this writing, I get the following result when running the above function:{ shown: 56, total: 827 }
                      
                  
      Spiffy | Berlin / Europe | Senior Go / Golang Developer(s) | madebyspiffy.com/jobs | REMOTE | PART-TIMEWe're small startup building a whiteboxed dispatch system to sell initially to taxi firms, we are a distributed company and work 100% remotely, 95% of costs are wages, we have no VC funding and pay our own way via revenue. We offer a paid trial month. As for the product we've found "market-fit" and we're now iterating towards a robust scalable finish.As a developer at spiffy you only work 20 hours a week, all we require is that you're around in the afternoon, there's no hierarchy & no management, we work in small vertical teams and you're expected to decide, design, implement, maintain & support. The wage (for everyone) is â‚¬3000 per month + VAT for now but you're employed as a consultant (less tax) and can take on other projects at the same time, not enough to live in London or Zurich but enough to live somewhere with a nice beach or even in Berlin (like me).As for tooling, we use github, jenkins & slack and we're always constantly improving. There are no skype calls, no meetings of any kind, no standups, no performance reviews, just open and honest communication.We are only looking for senior developers (3+ years) at this moment who can be around in the afternoons Central European TimeI personally would like to work with someone who employs TDD pragmatically and writes clean maintainable code. Who is widely read, possessing a depth of experience and able to bring ideas to the table. Experience building, operating & testing distributed systems would be a massive plus.At the moment we've developed a microservice architecture on app engine and we'll be moving to containers in the near future. We don't expect you to have three years of Go experience but you need have something in Go/Golang to show us.Just write a short cover letter detailing your past projects and what you'll bring but don't forget to indicate that you've read into what the company is about. Multi stage interviews are too resource consuming so if we like your application and you come across well in the interview then we'll invite you for a paid trial month.Email us at hello@madebyspiffy.com

      What's the stack like?
                      
                  
      Javascript, Postgres, some Go (hopefully more Go soon). Redis for background job processing, though it hasn't been very reliable and we're investigating alternatives.
                      
                  
      We pushed tens of millions of jobs through Redis/Resque daily with no issues.  We had other instances receiving 30-50mbps of increment and set operations 24/7, too.I'm curious what problems you guys are running into.  Redis has been one of the best and most reliable pieces of software I've ever used.
                      
                  
      hey! thanks for the reply. I'm sure it would be fine if we had it configured correctly - the issues we're seeing are a) unexpected behavior in the queue/worker library we are using, b) it was installed before most of us got there, and we don't understand the failure modes, and c) we don't have good visibility into the state of the system when it fails.I have full faith in Redis as a tool, and I'm sure there are reliable queue/worker libraries that work with it but we don 't have one of them. even with a reliable datastore you need to make sure you're not dequeueing things twice or putting things back on the queue or suddenly having your workers stop processing things - we've seen all of these, and like everything, it's been tricky to balance "rewrite the entire thing" vs. "make it good enough & focus on delivering business value".
                      
                  
      Thanks for the details.  That balance is tricky to maintain.  I've inherited my share of bad codebases at startups.  :)
                      
                  
      By Javascript, do you mean node.js?Interesting about your Redis issue. I've found it to be reliable. Could you email me? (check profile) I'll try to help troubleshooting. The job sounds interesting, but troubleshooting is more fun. :)
                      
                  
      Yes, he means node.js. (I also work at Shyp)

      Nava | Washington DC^ | Experienced full-stack developers/devops/product manager/operations | On-site - Full TimeWe're a small team of engineers from Silicon Valley that came out to DC last year to help fix Healthcare.gov. It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to fix. And itâ€™s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.Our revamped Healthcare.gov application has been used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. The login system we rebuilt is about two orders of magnitude more reliable and two orders of magnitude less expensive; for example, itâ€™s about $70M less per year to operate.People die because the Veteran's Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures. [0]Thatâ€™s not because thereâ€™s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right.

      Joyent, San Francisco / Vancouver | ONSITE or REMOTE | Software engineerRecently, the world has figured out what we at Joyent have known for a long time: that operating system containers are the future of elastic infrastructure. While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house). Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure!
E-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject "Software engineer") or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill)
                      
                  
      Why "remote-friendly in the US and Canada" only?
                      
                  
      Probably for ease of managing benefits, payments/salaries, employment law and such
                      
                  
      That would make sense except that in my experience all of that is far easier (law, tax, health insurance, etc.) when employees are international.
                      
                  
      Timezones sounds like the most likely reason.
                      
                  
      As one would think, but then why not include Central/South America and the Caribbean?
                      
                  
      They won't comment it publicly, but smells like a racism to me...
                      
                  
      Elevate | iOS Engineer | REMOTE or Bay Area, part time (or full time) contractorApple's App of the Year in 2014. 
http://elevateapp.comI work full-time on Elevate's iOS app. We make brain training games, so most of the company works on cross-platform games. I'm the one responsible for everything on iOS that isn't a game.We ship improvements to the app and a new game every month. You would take your own tasks and help with code review for each release.Objective C and some C++ experience is necessary, we also use Swift in some isolated places, and would like to use Swift wherever feasible.The app is very animation heavy. CoreAnimation experience is useful. Understanding what causes performance issues and how to use Xcode's profiling tools is useful too. We have really talented designers who cry when you build ugly things.It's a pretty chill gig. We probably need at least half of your time around a deadline, but usually you can spend as much time as you want working on stuff. The well of tasks never runs dry. We have an office, but Slack+Trello means you can work from anywhere.Send at least your Github username to me: david+hn@elevateapp.comLinks to anything you've done that is on the App Store is way more interesting to me than a resume.

      BrandVerity |Seattle, WA| Full-time Onsite Python DevelopersAt BrandVerity we think big and we don't cut corners. The internet is full of bad guys trying to trick unsuspecting users and make a quick buck. Our mission is simple: Clean up the internet. We're a small company and the only way we can deliver on this mission is if everyone we hire is talented, passionate, and committed to doing things the right way.We do a lot of web crawling to trace the flow of web traffic, or identify places where their brand is being used incorrectly or inappropriately in specific offers, free form text, or even images. Directing a crawl against big chunks of the web and filtering the results to find the needle in the internet haystack has many challenges, and certainly puts our core work in the "Big Data" realm.We're looking for an experienced engineer who is a strong individual contributor but also wants to share their experience with some extremely capable but more junior team members. Weâ€™re very collaborative, and our engineers are some of the best communicating people around, because we appreciate that even if you can solve a problem well, being able to communicate about it is just as important. The strong developer weâ€™re seeking will have the foundations to easily adapt to a new stack, so weâ€™re not looking for specific skill buzzwords. Experience with Python, AWS, and non-relational data storage would help you ramp up faster, but weâ€™re willing to invest the time if you come with the right stuff but not the same stack.If this sounds worth having a conversation about, please drop us a line at jobs@brandverity.com

  Clojure, ClojureScript,

      The locations are Florida, Texas, Virginia, and Maryland. Note that the Florida location would let you afford a big house in a decent neighborhood that is near both work and the beach. This is ONSITE. We hire INTERNS, experienced/old/PhD, and everything in between.Most of our work is low-level. We deal in assembly language (assembler) for MIPS, ARM, x86/x64, PowerPC (ppc), MSP430, 8051, AVR32, and many many others. We write debuggers, disassemblers, emulators, hypervisors, static analysers (for both source and binary), and similar bug-finding tools.You can run the OS of your choice. Overtime is fully paid and optional, so you can earn more if you wish or just enjoy your hobbies/family/sleep. Extreme flex-time lets you wake up late and/or run errands during the day.http://advancedsecuritylabs.com/
                      
                  
      Do you have any recommendations for a web developer who's looking to get into low level programming? After focusing on higher order languages like Javascript and Java for so long, it's hard to know where to start.
                      
                  
      That's a tough one. Maybe you could help work on a JIT for Javascript or Java. This would get you into working on the low-level stuff while still making use of your existing knowledge. Another option is to pretend you are back in school. Find a course with syllabus and homework assignments posted online, buy the book that goes with the course, and do all the assignments. The aggressive approach is to just sit down and write your own boot loader or maybe jump into a capture the flag (CTF) problem with IDA Pro. In case you want to learn from a simple OS, look into xv6 from MIT. Add a few features, possibly as suggested for various courses that use the OS for teaching. You could add a debugging interface. Another idea is to write a disassembler.

      WalmartLabs - Clojure Developer. | SF | Remote (US Timezones) | 1HB VISAYou can work on Clojure at quite a few companies, but rarely can you impact millions of people at such a personal level. Walmart's mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success. We started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.We're still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests & code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It's a tough balance but we've found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.Some aspects of our work that are important to us:  - high performance distributed systems
  - robust & well-factored codebases
  - simple & fast deployments
  - automating the hell out of operations
  - thorough system test coverage
  - managing our own development process and work backlog
  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)
  - contributing back to the clojure & open source community

What we do:  - write all our production systems & tools in Clojure
  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems
  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming & ingesting large volumes of data

For a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk I gave at Clojure/West. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4.Does this sound like something you're into? Shoot me an email at amarcar@walmartlabs.com

      SkyCircuits Ltd | http://www.skycircuits.com/ | Salisbury, UK [ONSITE]We specialise in manned and unmanned aircraft operations and technology. Our business is rapidly expanding in one of the most exciting and technically challenging areas of aerospace: that of unmanned aviation. As well as our core business iterating on (probably?) Europe's best selling commercial UAV autopilot, we also take on a wide variety of fantastic r&d projects. The vast majority of our business involves civil drones and we do not sell autopilots into the military market.We're based in beautiful Wiltshire countryside, near Stonehenge. We have our own drone testing site (and a variety of off-road vehicles) & encourage all our employees to fly. Things here can be fast-paced but always interesting and everyone's opinions are valued.We're looking to fill the following roles:
- GUI Developer (C#, F#, Python)
- Embedded Systems Programmer (C, Python)For more information please see http://www.callenlenz.com/careers (Callen-Lenz is the ops side of the company).If you have any general questions about the company or roles, feel free to email g.roberts at the skycircuits domain.
                      
                  
      I really can't understand how Python and F# can be in the same role.
                      
                  
      Top secret black magic in F#, generic GUI-and-system code in C#, user-facing app-specific stuff in IronPython? (IronPython possibly taking advantage of some kind of REPL and/or hot reloading to provide quick iteration for the developers. Also maybe gives the option of end-user extensibility.)
                      
                  
      I think IronPython is the worst of both worlds to be honest.

      I tried, but it said the post was too long. Even the above post was significantly shortened to get it to work.

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsiteLead Designer - Product Manager - Product Analytics Manager - Software EngineerRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after three years, weâ€™re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (17M kids), and 39,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of 70 (30 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out what weâ€™re working on at https://github.com/clever.
