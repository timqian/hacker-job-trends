      OkHi | Full Stack Engineer | Nairobi, Kenya - Solve a problem affecting 4B people across the worldhttp://okhi.comThere are more people in the world without a physical address than with. 4 billion people in fact. Itâ€™s our mission to empower them with an address that works. We're doing this by building the next generation of a physical address system to increase commerce through better logistics, save lives through improved emergency services and grow access to finance through a better identity system.We're looking a full-stack developer to join our small team of 7 in Nairobi.

      Looks like an awesome and ambitious project. I thought about doing the same (or something about digitalizing all the existing addresses) but never worked on it.
                      
                  
      Thanks! Where were you thinking about doing the project and digitalizing for what purpose?It's been quite an interesting ride - I used to live in SF and now am seeing see firsthand such an interesting contrast. There are so many emerging market-specific tech challenges, both as things a startup can address (like us) and as part of the design process in building tech that works for a radically different consumer.
                      
                  
      What about remote option, at least for the beginning?
                      
                  
      GitHub is hiring across all teams, both in SF and remote: https://github.com/about/jobs.We especially need sales engineers, which is a great role for any developer or ops person looking to make a transition to sales. Especially important skills:  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills
  * Customer facing experience as this is a pre-sales role
  * Familiarity with Git and GitHub
  * Ability to talk with both technical and non-technical employees 
    both internal to GitHub and at customer sites

You can see the sales engineering job post here: https://jobs.github.com/positions/2f1183c2-482d-11e4-9945-68...One last thing that I'd like to point out for all of our roles (it's at the bottom of the job post too, but I think it's important): GitHub is made up of people with many different backgrounds and lifestyles, and we like it that way. We invite applications from people of all stripes. We don't discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences that people imagine to discriminate against one another.Please apply if you think this might be a good fit for you. You can't waste our time!
                      
                  
      I'm a dev that uses git, and I have outstanding written and verbal skills, but I've never led a team, and certainly not for 3-7 years. I've never had a group of people working under me in dev roles. Is that a deal-breaker?
                      
                  
      No, definitely not! Please apply.
                      
                  
      I think you want me for hiring coordinator. I especially appreciate these requirements: 1. Be a friendly, calming guide to candidates on their interview day. 2. Working with our recruiters and hiring managers for each role to optimize the success of their candidates. 3. Crafting an engaging interview day for each candidate.
                      
                  
      Do you guys hire post-secondary interns?
                      
                  
      We don't have an internship program in place at the moment.
                      
                  
      Would you consider hiring someone for a remote, full time or part time position that has relevant work experience but not a degree (yet)?To be more clear, I've got a year left to complete my degree in CS but I feel that I'm more than capable of contributing to an organization without an internship program.
                      
                  
      Yes, absolutely!
                      
                  
      Darn, I guess I'll have to wait till I graduate.

      If your public funding so far is only $120K how can you recruit guys who make that much in a year ;-)
                      
                  
      Indeed, YCombinator gave us the $120K.Our total funding + revenues are much higher. You missed the part about Khosla Ventures, DARPA, and Fortune 500 contracts, and that we are already profitable :). Biology, especially when done through software, is a very profitable domain.

      Planet Labs -- http://planet.com/ -- San Francisco, CA(Remote work depends on the role -- some are onsite only, others may be available to remote workers.)Planet Labs has a large number of positions open. We're a collection of electrical, mechanical, aerospace, software, science, etc. folks looking to image the whole planet on a daily basis with a large number of small satellites. It's a terrific bunch of folks doing what we call "agile aerospace".I've personally been with the company for over a year, working on "Mission Control", an internal web app for managing the satellites and make life easier on our "Spaceship Captains" -- the operators who manage them. This is definitely one of the most interesting and fun roles I've had in my career (and I've had a few).Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects. We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software. Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, dev ops, site reliability engineers, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we're growing.Full list of jobs at https://www.planet.com/careers/#openings
                      
                  
      I applied for Embedded Systems Engineer, but since I'm looking for remote work, and I'm not sure if this position is remote, I'm going to apply for other positions as well (I have solid experience with web development on mobile and Objective-C on iOS).
I hope this is OK.
                      
                  
      Yes -- feel free to apply for all roles you're interested in.
                      
                  
      Is it best to apply through the site? The ground station devops role seems like it was created for me :)
                      
                  
      Sounds like a great fit for me, if it has a remote option (East Coast)...
                      
                  
      It depends on the role... we've got a number of remote employees.
                      
                  
      Yep, that is the way to apply.
                      
                  
      Any mobile positions? (iOS / Android)This is my experience:
https://www.linkedin.com/pub/abdurrahman-qadan/47/6b8/833
                      
                  
      Not really -- we don't have mobile apps.
                      
                  
      This is a company I would love to work at.  I really like what they are doing and the mission.  Any way I can get in contact with a recruiter from there?
                      
                  
      Yep -- simply apply for a role.
                      
                  
      Is it possible for a non-American (Canadian) to apply?
                      
                  
      Now you guys are pushing it...J/K, yes, and we have several Canadians already employed at the company, as well as folks from some other countries.
                      
                  
      Do you mean remote or actually getting to move to San Francisco?
                      
                  
      Working in SF would certainly be an option for most (if not all) roles, and working remote in the US is an option for some roles.As for working remote outside the US ... we do have a few folks who do that.  I believe there are hoops to jump through in some cases, but we'd jump through those hoops for the right people.

      I wanted to let others know I went through the first and second part of the interview for Code Wrangler and it certainly was one of the more unique ones.The first part was a Skype text chat that lasted for over an hour. It was not like anything I ever had before. For starters, there is no conversing through voice. I talked pretty much only about why I chose Elixir for a project and explaining a lot about Elixir itself. The interview itself seemed like a test to see how well I knew what I was talking about, could convey information to someone without experience in the tech, and remain calm without getting frustrated about someone questioning everything, etc.The second part of the interview was trial by fire of taking a WordPress plugin, adding a new feature, and ultimately improving it. If you don't work in PHP or have any experience in WordPress this is a lot more work than you'd expect if you are like me and go to serious lengths to improve it all around. I myself have neither real experience in PHP or WordPress. I was given a week to accomplish this, but strangely enough my contact never followed up with me after I told him I had completed it via Skype until I sent him an email several days later. I did get some feedback, but at this point I had decided on taking a job offer from someone else rather than chance not getting hired after their Trial, if it were to be offered to me, which it sounded like based on the feedback I would.For the most part, the process left a favorable impression, so don't be scared to give it a shot. I think the roughest part was my contact was not US based, so you can't get responses as quickly.
                      
                  
      Thanks for applying. Sorry we didn't get back to you promptly. That should never happen. Our process is different enough that we are still trying to figure out how to scale it well.Some more details, the pre-test before the trial project depends on the position. For Data Wranglers it is very different from the one you had.For anyone who wants more details, our CEO wrote about our hiring process here: https://hbr.org/2014/01/hire-by-auditions-not-resumes/
                      
                  
      I'm intrigued by the Data Wrangler job description. Is it a hybrid role, like 50% Data Engineer + 50% Data Scientist? (Or did I misunderstand the description?)
                      
                  
      If we can find folks who do both, that's great. That's a hard unicorn to find. :)We're really hiring both data scientists and data engineers. In my case I do a bit of both, but lean more towards scaling large systems. We also have folks who fall squarely into either the scientist or engineer camps.Titles can never capture the spectrum of what a person can or wants to do. Scaling large data processing and storage systems, understanding user behavior, deploying everything from simple ranking to advanced machine learning, integrating clever algorithms seamlessly with front end web development to create fluid experiences for our users... All of this is important to us.
                      
                  
      Sounds great!You mentioned to Akumma that "the pre-test before the trial project depends on the position. For Data Wranglers it is very different from the one you had."So, given that you're hiring both data scientists and data engineers, do you give a different pre-test, depending on which role the candidate leans more towards?
                      
                  
      You'll have to apply to find out. ;)

      Brooklyn, NYC - Hillary Clinton Presidential CampaignWe are hiring engineers at all levels (IC and people managers) across the entire stack: frontend, backend, devops and data infrastructure.Email your resume to Kyle Rush (me) krush@hillaryclinton.com.Many of our applications are Python hosted on AWS, but we will be building many more applications over the course of the campaign. Here are some example applications you might work on:Fundraising: Hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars process through millions of donations. We will web donations, one-click donations, SMS donations, P2P donations, mobile app donations, merchandise store, and more.Grassroots events: Hundreds of thousands of events will be created by supporters across the country.Internal tools: Applications that improve field organizing, HQ operations, and enable the hundreds of state staff around the country to be more efficient.Data infrastructure - Won't say much on this except that we have a lot of data and we will be leveraging it in innovative ways.Integrations: We have many apps, both internal and external, that we need to work well with each other.There will be many, many, other applications. Can't stress that enough :)
                      
                  
      Anyone: Is is a good career move to work for a presidential candidate?  Anyone have experience with doing so helping of hurting their career?Also what if the candidate turns out to not be very popular?
                      
                  
      No personal experience, but I can't imagine thinking less of someone for taking work with a candidate, even if I didn't personally like the candidate â€“Â it'd at least make you stand out a little more. Plus, if there were a hiring manager who would hold it against you that you worked for Hillary Clinton or Mitt Romney or John McCain or whomever, that's probably a manager who's unbearable in other ways too.One potential (and, again, totally made-up) caveat: Working for a well-known politician like Hillary Clinton is probably very different from working with a joke candidate or the "Rent is too damn high" guy.
                      
                  
      A very liberal friend applied to the Romney campaign during the previous election cycle and ended up working on his campaign. Didn't hurt his career at all, and he got a lot of good stories out of it.

We've launched ~90 satellites so far (and had 8 on the SpaceX CRS-7 rocket :( )Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects. We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software. Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we're growing.Some gigs are onsite only, others may be available to remote workers.Full list of jobs at https://www.planet.com/careers/#openingsPress:A Tech Start-Up Just Restored My Faith in Humanity â€”Â http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/tech-start-up-r...Planet Labs: The Satellite-launching Startup That Took On National Governments -- And Elon Musk â€” http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/05/features/pla...

      Amazon | AmazonUI (AUI) | Seattle; San Francisco | Onsite | Full-TimeAUI is the Front-end platform being adopted on Amazon.com. We are modernizing the company's front end code base, while diving deep on latency, performance, API design, user experience, and cross browser/device compatibility. Basically, we need people who can build libraries, not just use them.Our team is incredibly customer-centric. For any given situation, we have to make the right choice on behalf of the folks using our platform -- and we have to do it at scale. That may sound cliche, but within the next hour AUI will be used to generate tens of millions of page views. And that's just in the US. Worldwide, we're used on about 90% of requests across all device categories.It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of opportunity. For example, we can run experiments that change almost every page on Amazon.com. We can also impact the page load time for the entire site. Have you ever tried to figure out why your site is 6ms slower? We have.We use these tools (but don't expect you to know all of them): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Perl, GitAnd to give you an idea of who you will be working with, the folks responsible for this articles are on our team:
http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...If you're interested, drop us an email. Heck, you can even drop us an email if you're in Seattle or San Francisco and you just want to have coffee:    function getEmailAddr( company ) {

      Underdog.io | New York, New York | https://underdog.io | Full-TimeWeâ€™re looking to hire employee #5 (engineer #3) and employee #6 (UI/UX designer #1).Today, Underdog.io is a curated marketplace for talent. We connect amazing people with founders and hiring managers at top startups.We donâ€™t charge placement fees because weâ€™re not recruiters. Weâ€™re building technology to reduce the noise of the job search and match. We started Underdog.io because we experienced the pains associated with (1) hiring while working at top startups in NYC and (2) looking for new opportunities.Our platform is currently live in NYC and SF, where we work with 160 awesome startups. Weâ€™ve had to turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network.As we scale, weâ€™ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates donâ€™t receive unsolicited outreach from recruiters and companies donâ€™t pay placement fees for the vast majority of their hires. Job search is organized and talented candidates have more high-quality options.Weâ€™re built with Python/Flask, Javascript/Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, S3. And we're big supporters of open source. Our Github: https://github.com/underdogioHere's a post that covers a recent engineering challenge we overcame: http://blog.underdog.io/post/119558043297/scaling-underdog-t...If you want to learn more about our first four months: https://medium.com/@joshuagoldstein/our-first-four-months-bu....Email chris@underdog.io to apply.Sorry, we can't sponsor visa candidates.Keywords: NYC, Brooklyn, Developer, Dev, Engineer, Python, Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, S3, Open source, https://www.underdog.io/
                      
                  
      Speaking from experience as one of the two current software engineers at Underdog.io. This is a great team to work with, we all strongly believe in the product and being so small (only 4 employees right now) we all get a lot of say in the direction of the company and the products we are building.From a more engineer stand point, as a team we believe in the value of quality code, transparency, knowledge sharing and contributing back to the open source community in any ways that we can. These are values that we will continue to uphold even as our team grows.We are running on an service oriented architecture with an internal API (Python/Flask) that is utilized by two other applications, our main website (Python/Flask) and an internal application (Node.js/express).If you have any questions please feel free to ask. :)
                      
                  
      FindTheBest.com | Santa Barbara, CAWhat are we up to: We are building the deepest, broadest, baddest knowledge graph on the planet. We have billions of entities, hundreds of billions of facts, an amazing presentation layer, and a growing distribution network of top tier publishers. Everyone needs knowledge (we have well over 100M citations a month), and weâ€™re here to satisfy that need.Whatâ€™s next: weâ€™ve built an amazing product architecture that leverages our expansive knowledge graph. The next step is to become a dominant force in the growing knowledge industry. I'd love to talk to anyone working or interested in this exciting space. Unsolicited outreach is strongly encouraged!About the team: The challenge of scaling human organizations is not unlike the task of scaling a technology stack. Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can't be dependent on hierarchy. Developers, designers, and data analysts can form small, cross-functional, mission-oriented teams that are able to operate decoupled of one another (Bezo's 2PT). Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.https://www.findthebest.com/careers/explore-opportunities
                      
                  
      > We are building the deepest, broadest, baddest knowledge graph on the planet.What does "baddest" mean in English? Doesn't feel like you mean "worst".
                      
                  
      It's American slang for good, essentially.
                      
                  
      http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Baddest
                      
                  
      It's usually found in the form of "biggest, baddest so-and-so".  Its connotation is like "badass".Mean ("lean, mean fighting machine") can also mean similar things

      Clever (YC S12) - Software Engineer - San Francisco - OnsiteRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after three years, weâ€™re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF.  Weâ€™re looking for full-stack engineers who like:-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanetsCheck us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer, or check out what weâ€™re working on at https://github.com/clever.

      Out of curiosity: I'm German and just had a look at the German NCC Group website's career section. It tried to redirect me to the UK site (the redirection is broken, btw.) and when I went there to have a look at the vacancies, there was nothing for Germany. Are you currently hiring here as well?
                      
                  
      Sorry, I really don't have any idea what our friends across the pond are doing with regards to hiring.
                      
                  
      (BTW, for those who miss him, Jeff is alive and well, but was super-busy with client work last week.)
                      
                  
      You had me at A/C bro!
                      
                  
      Do you allow remote work or only onsite?
                      
                  
      The majority of our work is done from our regional offices or on client sites, but we do offer remote work options for senior-level candidates willing to travel. I hope that helps!

      Indeed! It keeps the beer cold and the hackers awake.

      Hey brasetvik, what can I do to make my application stand out? I was excited to see that Elastic was hiring in an area of interest to me, so I threw my hat into the ring. I worry that I'm going to get dropped into a large pile and skimmed over- is there anything proactive I can do to prevent this?
                      
                  
      I'm also interested in this, because I was rejected for even an interview despite ticking all the boxes in the req I applied to.

find it! (Once we discovered that the code needed three volatile keywords
added, on two lines of code!)If you thrive on troubleshooting software problems and designing creative

It got many great replies (including a number talking about how people's friends had typically had 2-3 jobs in the time they'd been with us), but this one stood out:"A combination of an informal environment, freedom, and high expectations - I wanted a place where I could be myself and grow doing/learning things that I was passionate about, while having lots of smart people around me to collaborate with in doing so. I came from a huge, strictly regimented and siloed company, and was fed up with being told "that's a great idea, but it's not your job", and Distilled seemed to be the polar opposite."

Instead, tomorrowâ€™s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital â€” all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you donâ€™t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. Weâ€™ve launched â€œLending as a Serviceâ€� (LaaS) to power this transformation.We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. We are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations, and capital markets.We want passionate, fun-loving people who can contribute positively to our company and our culture. Let us know if this sounds like you.http://www.insikt.comTechnologies:front-end: angular, react
