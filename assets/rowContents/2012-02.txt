      These guys are being far too humble.The Everyme guys are one of the most impressive early stage mobile companies - in terms of product and founding team - I have seen for a long time. They've sold millions of iPhone applications in the past and now they've raised money from Greylock (Facebook) and Andreessen Horrowitz (Jawbone, Fab, etc) and dozens of other investors to take over the world.If I were a designer (which I am) and were looking to join a company that was going to create a gorgeous product that has a significant chance to become the next Facebook, I'd join these guys in a beat.

      Salt Lake City, UT. - http://www.lucidchart.comLucidChart is an HTML5 diagramming application that proves web apps don't need to be pale imitations of their full-featured desktop counterparts. Real-time collaboration and full versioning history aren't our only advantages; users tell us they like LucidChart because it's faster, easier, and smoother than Visio and Omnigraffle.We need great engineers who want to work in a Silicon Valley startup, but would rather live 15 minutes from the ski resorts in Utah. We have one of the largest Javascript codebases on the Internet supporting LucidChart's client, and are using Scala, PHP, node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL to power our servers. Experience in one or more of these areas is helpful, but we're most interested in people with inhuman problem solving skills.We currently have 9 full-time employees, including 6 engineers. That ratio reflects the focus of our organization -- we are a software company, and we live or die on the strength of our engineering team. We think we have the strongest engineering team in Utah, and want to add at least 3-5 people this year.All hires are made by unanimous decision of the current team.

      Knewton: New York (NYC) funded startup seeking software engineers interested in functional programming, machine learning, distributed systems, and "big data" problems. +ONSITE, +REMOTE, +FULLTIME, +INTERN. I am not personally sure (I'm a software engineer) about H1-B but I will refer any visa questions to someone who can answer them.Investors include Peter Thiel (Founder's Fund), Reid Hoffman, and Pearson, a leader in educational publishing. We were recognized as a Technology Pioneer for 2011 by the World Economic Forum in Davos and one of the top 25 best places to work by Crainâ€™s New York Business.We have about 80 employees right now. We pay full market salaries plus stock options, and you can take as much vacation as you need. Hours are typically 40-50 per week.Our product is an adaptive learning platform, which means we use machine learning and "big data" techniques to deliver an individualized education to each student. Our eventual goal is to make a high-quality, adaptive education available to everyone in the world. The product is used by Arizona State University right now, and we recently signed a deal with Pearson to power many of their products.Our code is a mix of Python, Java, and Scala. Most of our existing code is in Python, but we're working to scale up in a major way, which involves a migration to the JVM. Currently this involves a mix of Java and Scala, but our long-term goal is to move toward Scala. Consequently, we're really hot for Scala talent right now. Anyone who has experience taking Scala into production we would love to talk to right now.You can reach me at knerd83 at gmail.com, and I'm a software engineer so I'll be able to answer any of your technical questions (e.g. why we're interested in Scala). Reach out if any of the following interest you:* Using technology to democratize education.* Machine learning and data mining, including approaches such as probablistic graphic models (PGMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Monte Carlo Markov Chains.* Functional programming (cf. Scala and Python).* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) internals and performance optimization.* NoSQL databases (Cassandra and Redis).* Thrift (the RPC protocol).* Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Unix) and distributed systems.

      We're looking for Django developers.Remote work is fine, but Providence, RI area is preferable (or, a willingness to consider relocation eventually; though to be clear, for the right person this isn't a requirement at all).We're a small design driven development company working exclusively on Django projects. Very flexible work environment, bonus options, etc. We are not a funded startup, we're bootstrapping ourselves. We have a large fluffy dog as the office mascot!Must enjoy, or tolerate, a wide variety of musical genres and styles.Email peter at projectevolution.com if you're interested!
                      
                  
      NYC - Founding Engineer / Lead Developer (Ruby) at Centzy (http://centzy.com)Centzy is Kayak for local services - comparison shopping for everyday local services like haircuts, dry cleaners, and oil changes. It's a large, untapped market, and we are funded by great investors who share our passion: Lightbank (Groupon's original investor) and ffVC (Klout's original investor).We are a team of two (one hacker, one business guy with a CS degree) and we are looking for another hacker. As our first hire, we would consider you a late co-founder and expect as much. You'll get serious product ownership with real equity and a salary. You'll be the third leg of the tripod.We're looking for someone who has built and scaled products on the Ruby / Rails stack in the past. You've probably worked at a startup if not started one. You are smart and relentlessly resourceful. You'll spend most of your time crafting code in Ruby and Javascript, so you should love it. We think hackers should drive product, so you should be comfortable doing this. You've probably at least dabbled in MongoDB and Node.js.We have great shared startup space in the Lower East Side with tons of great food and bar options nearby. In addition to equity and salary, you'll get your choice of equipment and we'll cover 100% of your health benefits, and lunches and dinners while you're working. And of course the fridge will always be stocked with soda and great micro brews.
                      
                  
      LocalBonus (New York, NY)
FULL TIME Rails Developer in NYC (or REMOTE)Why us:
- Product is something you'd use (we let consumers use their existing credit/debit cards as loyalty cards at local businesses)
- Seed funding already closed (recently... so we have runway)
- You'd be the third person on the team so there's plenty of equity to work with
- We're currently in the Entrepreneur's Roundtable Accelerator program (http://eranyc.com)
- CTO has 12 years software dev experience, 6 years managing tech teams.  He's an awesome mentor (and generally awesome guy).  Among other things, he managed the team that built Australia's largest Ruby on Rails application.
- CEO is a Stanford grad with 6+ years direct experience in our industry
- Ability to shape corporate culture.  We tend to be disciplined and professional about the stuff that matters and very casual/flexible about the stuff that doesn't.
- Our main stack is Rails 3.1, MySQL (moving to MongoDB soon), jQuery, and HAML.
- Looking to build out our iOS and Android platform.  If you have experience here, you'd be in charge of this.Ideal candidate:
- 2-3 years full time dev experience in Ruby (will consider light Ruby experience or more junior if you're a solid fit and eager to learn)
- Smart / raw talent / logical thought process important
- Entrepreneurial hustle - basically someone that wants to contribute a lot to LocalBonus and then be CTO/Founder of their own company after this.Email tim@localbonus.com
                      
                  
      Weâ€™re looking for a UI/UX designer in Melbourne, Australia.Full-time preferable; part-time or intern possible.Weâ€™re a startup based in Carlton. Weâ€™re working on a web/email app that makes it easier to write documents with other people. It automatically keeps track of what changed and who did the work, without requiring people to modify how they currently do things, whether it be by passing attachments around by email or by sharing documents in dropbox. Itâ€™s not launched yet.Design is really important to us and youâ€™ll be our first dedicated designer. (Right now our team is approximately 4 developers and a business guy.) Weâ€™re running into lots of design challenges and need someone to take the lead on these, in addition to designing the overall experience. As an example, this week we are thinking about how to show the changes between two Word documents in a clearer way than the Word compare view (which is horrible!).We dream of hiring a junior version of Ryan Singer. We want someone whoâ€™s quite analytical about the design process. Regarding technical stuff, you need to be able to work in HTML and CSS, have a good understanding of whatâ€™s possible to do with Javascript, and know or be willing to learn git.Get in touch with me (ben@contextualsystems.com) with any questions, or send a CV and link to your portfolio to apply. Iâ€™ll put a more detailed job ad up at http://contextualsystems.com/jobs/ soon.

Fun people to be around, they really appreciate that taking care of engineers is vital to the company's success, management is deeply technical all the way up to the CEO, and they have regular all-hands meetings where they say just about anything you could want to know about the company.I was so impressed that I've kept working on-and-off when I have the time, and I convinced my brother to apply and take a job there.http://www.cloudera.com/company/careers/

      Bay Area or Los Angeles or Shanghai strongly preferred, but remote work is possible for exceptional candidates (must live in the U.S.). Full-time only. H1B is okay. We also have several summer internship opportunities.Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider, so that developers, startups, and big companies can focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We believe in openness and transparency rather than proprietariness and obfuscation.We have a terrific team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense). In late 2010, we raised a Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz, and our customers and partners include Facebook, Newsweek, Loopt, and Blekko. We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.We currently have about half a dozen job openings, from data engineering to software engineering to system administration. For the software engineering position, you would ideally know Java, Clojure, and/or Ruby, and you'll get bonus points for experience with machine learning, NoSQL, algorithms, infrastructure, and/or Hadoop.If you're interested in the Bay Area office, it just opened in December of 2011, so you'd have a significant influence on the culture there.You can email me personally at leo -at- factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:Palo Alto Software Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Software engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Data Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews

      San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.Academia.edu has over 950,000 registered users, and over 3 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,000 academics join each day.We need talented engineers to come and help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that there is a chance to make a big impact.We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We have a strong engineering culture. We're a 6 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:â˜… building new features (a conference feature, a discussion feature for papers)â˜… enhancing existing features (News Feed, Profile page, paper upload tools)â˜… building back-end infrastructure to scale the siteWhat we're looking for are:â˜€ 2+ years of web development experienceâ˜€ Experience with the full engineering stackâ˜€ Passion for engineeringAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture. There is more information here http://academia.edu/hiring.H1B candidates are very welcome. We will take care of the visa process.If you are interested to learn more, please email Richard Price at richard [at] academia.edu

      Seattle, San Francisco, Cupertino (and other places), FULL-TIME, INTERN, H1BA lot of people think Splunk must be a terrible place to work at because they think it is an "enterprise" company. But the truth is, we have great jobs for a lot of people. Want to work on awesome visualizations for gigabytes and terabytes of data daily? We got it. Want to work on building a development platform for an extremely powerful data analysis tool? We got it. Want to help make the core server that powers our extremely fast indexing and performance better? We got it.For example, my project for the past couple of months has been to develop our new Node.js/Browser SDK, including pulling some of our propietary UI components and sharing them with the world. We also do a lot of work with customers to best help them use Splunk. One of the projects I was involved in included analyzing social data using Splunk (like Twitter/Foursquare).Whether it's UI, core systems engineering, dev platform or anything in between, we likely have something for you. I personally work on the development platform in the Seattle office, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything. Feel free to shoot me an email (in my profile), or comment here.I wanted to highlight a few specific positions we're looking for:* Dev. Platform Software Engineer: This is the team I work on. We strongly believe that there is a use for Splunk outside of logging, and we're enabling the usage of the technology for dealing with large quantities of data, whether it's for social network analysis, cloud management or anything in between. http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oHkCVfwi* Frontend engineer: We're trying to present a lot of data (some might even call it big data :) in a human-understandable manner. Help us implement the next wave of visualizations: http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=okO3VfwQ* UI/UX Designer: For many of our customers, they spend a great deal of their day in our web UI, and even more importantly, they spend time there when something is going wrong and they want to find out what. Help us make the UI/UX as easy and intuitive to use as possible: http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=okQ4VfwT* Cloud Software Engineer: we're developing the next stage of our product, which is a hosted version of Splunk in the cloud, with all the benefits you'd expect (like automatic elastic scaling). Come help us make this a reality: http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o4U8VfwL* Hadoop Software Engineer: Usage of Hadoop is exploding to do batch-oriented processing on massive quantities of data. We think there is a lot of value to be had by combining the power of Splunk and Hadoop, and we're developing solutions to make this possible. http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oqCaWfwS* Software Engineer in Test: Splunk is a complex machine, deployed in a distributed manner, many times being used for different things. Our testing team is top notch, and helps us deliver quality releases. http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o5ZvVfwe
                      
                  
      Providence, RI - Swipely (https://swipely.com)Senior UX EngineerWant to change the world?  Love creating awesome user experiences?  Keep reading.THE MISSIONSwipely revolutionizes how local merchants do business, arming them with innovative technology that puts the clunky, archaic systems used by big retailers to shame. We're the Robin Hood of business, disrupting the payment space to enable the little guys to do what only the big guys can, and then some. We interact directly with both merchants and their customers, impacting the personal experience on both sides in deep, meaningful ways. We turn rewards and loyalty upside-down (or, as we see it, rightside-up!) by giving points and discounts to customers through their credit card, without the need for special cards, mobile apps, bar codes, or anything else that gets in the way of the experience. We analyze every payment transaction, providing intuitive reports and automated tools for merchants that use them to grow and deeply engage their customers. And that's just the beginning of the possibilities with our passionate team, unique resources, and mission to make our merchants successful!THE OPPORTUNITYCombine a world-class front-end team with a powerfully creative atmosphere, and you get a compelling culture that liberates us all to envision and realize innovative product ideas every day. You will push your own limits of what you think is possible with a user experience. You will propose and refine new concepts, comps, technologies, and solutions, and get the support needed across the company to realize the untapped potential we have yet to discover.  You will work with top sales, marketing, and product talent that deeply values innovation and the engineers that drive it.Evolution is our greatest ally. We built the first incarnation of Swipely with jQuery, experimented with Backbone yet quickly realized we needed more structure, and now cruise on YUI3, with YUI3.5 around the corner. We rock MVC-driven, single-page applications, fully templatized Handlebars views, restful JSON persistence to our Rails backends, frontend unit and integration tests, and (soon!) a pushState architecture with hot data visualizations.We always track and contribute to new technologies like D3, Node.js, Ember, Harmony, CoffeeScript, and Less. Exploration and collaboration are part of our culture, and any topic that can improve our engineering efforts is fair game, including NoSQL storage, Nginx/Unicorn architecture, and deployment and continuous integration tools.THE REQUIREMENTSYou love what you do. You wake up every day more passionate about the webâ€™s IxD models and UX than the day before. You demand the highest quality of your projects and want to work with people who demand and inspire the same, from the code down to the pixels. You get energized when opening new Fireworks and Photoshop comps and diving deep with designers.You are self-directed and take initiative with confidence, yet know when to include others. You communicate effectively and thoughtfully. You appreciate the value of documentation. You are accountable for the entire user experience, from conception to production.You love contributing to opensource. Your Github profile is a hive of exciting collaborations. You strive to learn and shape emerging projects. You lead and inspire others with your own applications and sites in your free time. You go out for drinks with your friends and have engrossing discussions about the web. You love freenode.Your JavaScript knowledge is one of your greatest assets. You instinctively understand where native JavaScript ends and frameworks begin. Your extensive experience with MVC and design patterns guides you to insightful and intuitive solutions. You are eager to define new TDD and BDD frontend flows. Youâ€™re gratified that your language of choice is currently the most popular on Github and is evolving in leaps and bounds on the server-side. You love your backend developer. You regard as common knowledge that robust, performant code is integral to a compelling UX.Your HTML5 and CSS3 expertise expands as fast as the specs are updated. You shiver with anticipation for Level 4 CSS selector support, consistent gradient rule syntax, and native grid layouts. You rock the Chrome Dev channel and wish the Safari updates were out already. You crave responsive design. You know when to go web versus native.THE BENEFITSSwipely is small yet growing rapidly with explosive signup rates (seriously, off the charts!) offering Silicon Valley style startup perks and more. We've got you covered on hardware -- configure your own laptop and bring on the Happy Hacker keyboards, dual-monitors, and pairing stations.
