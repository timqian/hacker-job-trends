SpaceX, Los Angeles.  Working remotely is not an option for new-hires.  In December we became the first private organization to put a spacecraft into orbit and return it safely (highlights: http://spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=57).  The other entities who've done this are all governments or governmental collaborations.  SpaceX is continuing our expansion.

      I saw your info session at MIT today.  I am a senior in EECS at MIT doing a 5 year S.B./M.Eng. program.  I like machine learning/vision and robotics and would love to get my hands dirty writing software that controls real physical systems.  I've published research at the intersection of cognitive science and decision theory and just won first place at MIT's autonomous robotics competition. I've done various other projects that you can read about at http://snikolov.weebly.com.  Shoot me an email at snikolov@mit.edu if you think there is a match (especially in the avionics software group).
                      
                  
      I'm 34 and recently engaged, but I would seriously move there and work for free if you would let me (and had a couch for me to sleep on). I am a US citizen but unfortunately my fiancee isn't on board.Keep doing awesome things guys/girls.
                      
                  
      Now that's a job worth taking. Do you guys sponsor visas (I'm not sure exactly how that works, to be honest)?
                      
                  
      Things like these make me want to be a US citizen.

      Macca, do you have any way of checking the status on applications? I applied a few months ago but never heard back either way.
                      
                  
      I'd like to apply as a new grad (I'm graduating in May), do you have time to chat via email or phone so we could talk about which position would be best, or should I just apply to one and see what happens?
                      
                  
      I'm curious as to how helpful these threads have been to both seekers and employers.  Has anyone found a job through one of these threads?  Do employers get meaningful applications?
                      
                  
      These threads are one of our top 2 most effective hiring vectors; we've hired many people off HN, and the candidates we get from HN are the best candidates we get from any source.The caliber of people we've been able to hire from HN is one of the primary reasons I spend time here.
                      
                  
      Your posts here are consistently useful and informative.  The HN community is definitely better for your presence.  I'm glad you are getting something in return, while at the same time providing jobs to HN readers.
                      
                  
      I posted a link that I am hiring a few weeks ago, and not only did I get a lot of hits, but I also got a lot of great resumes; some of the best resumes I have ever seen.
                      
                  
      I second tptacek.  This is one of the most effective places we have found candidates - we just hired our 3rd person from HN.  Every candidate that has approached us through HN has been thoughtful and intelligent - although obviously not everyone is a match for what we are working on.  Certainly I can offer anyone from here a actual person to talk to about your background and interests and what we are working on.
                      
                  
      I found my current job at Monetate here, and am quite happy with the ease I was brought aboard. When I was looking last summer, it was easy to ctrl+f the hiring threads for my location. On the whole, I find the job descriptions succinct -- an immediate snapshot of what it would be like to work somewhere is important. And finally, the quick communication after I made contact gave me confidence that this place was serious about finding the right people.
                      
                  
      I learned that Bump was hiring through one of these threads last year. I am currently gainfully employed here.
                      
                  
      Pretty meaningless to me. I responded to a few awhile back and all I got were form letters.
                      
                  
      I landed an internship earlier (and a job eventually) from one of these threads.
                      
                  
      I've found these threads to be great as a former seeker.

      Sounds exciting.  What kind of work would the dev be doing?
                      
                  
      Building everything from an educational badging system (http://bjk5.com/post/2426884194/khan-academy-now-has-badges) to an improved practice UI based on student behavior (http://bjk5.com/post/2071068737/khan-academy-in-the-classroo...) to better individual student analytics (http://bjk5.com/post/2783333652/students-need-better-self-as...) to basic UX improvements all over the place.(Sorry for self-promotional-looking links...they're legit sources of information for this question.)
                      
                  
      I am an MBA(General) student at St. Bonaventure University. I like the motto of Khan Academy very much and would love to be a part of the organization. I am constrained area wise but if there is anything(Marketing, Human Resources) in "work-from-home" mode, I am all yours!
                      
                  
      You don't happen to need a part-time (2-3 days a week) designer/front-end developer as well do you?
                      
                  
      If your front-end dev work includes JS experience and you're interested in/passionate about math, our part-time contributors are currently focused on building out our JS-powered library of math practice exercises, and we would love help.
                      
                  
      The not-for-profit I do work for has a lot of similar-sounding exercises. They're all written in Java (right now), but I'm working with our devs to get lots of them converted to JS/HTML5.http://shodor.org/interactivateDrop me a line; I'd be interested in what you all are working on.
                      
                  
      Not that good at JS yet. My background is in design and crafting enjoyable user experiences. I am very passionate about education though.

      when i read your intro paragraph all i thought was "like what the world need is more quick and shallow interviews"... but reading your site there are pretty good tips and vision.you may focus that tagline in the time not wasted instead of the short interview time.
                      
                  
      Thanks for that feedback. Great point. I'll try to keep it in mind.

      We hire smart people who get the job done. Yeah, we use a lot of Java. And RoR. And Hadoop, Cassandra, etc. We use AWS and we run a DC stuffed with custom-configured servers. In general, the knowledge of a specific technology/language/framework we already use can be helpful, but not a requirement. Chances are, you don't know everything you need to know to do this job. So willingness and ability to learn is a requirement.
                      
                  
      Thats fair! I wish I did know everything. Thanks for the response!
                      
                  
      I know it's not in the traditional vein of what people look for at HN, but Microsoft is hiring for Commercial Technical Support in Dallas (Irving) TX, Charlotte NC, and (I think) Fargo ND.  There are openings in a variety of groups (SharePoint, Windows OS, SQL, IIS, Exchange) and for a variety of positions (Support [Escalation] Engineer, which is phone-based, and Escalation Engineer, which is debug/code-based).Note: I work for Microsoft in CTS, though I'm posting on my own.

      The website says that the dress code is 'business casual'? So, no jeans or sneakers?
                      
                  
      I think we're at the more formal end of "business casual", but I normally wear a collared shirt and slacks, with no tie or jacket.
                      
                  
      Too bad!Thanks for the reply though.
                      
                  
      don't dismiss it out of hand - I worked for about 20 months at a big financial corp and got a good laugh most days checking myself out in the corporate uniform . . .it's not so bad, but it is funny if you come from a place where flip-flops and the shirt you painted the house in last weekend is normal M-F attire.  It definitely took me awhile to get used to sitting in my cube in nice shoes.
                      
                  
      I wear nice shoes to work sometimes, and sometimes I don't feel like it. Rules tend to make me bristle, especially meaningless ones like dress style. Horses for courses and all that.

      note: I see you guys improved the writing on the homepage. Congrats! :)  You went from this:"SnapBill is an online invoicing and billing system with service provisioning capabilities. SnapBill is perfect for all businesses, especially those providing services requiring an automated recurring or subscription billing system and payment collection facilities."to this:"SnapBill is an online invoicing and billing system that allows you to easily sell your services online. SnapBill is perfect for businesses requiring an automated recurring or subscription billing system with payment collection facilities."Much better. (But what are "payment collection facilities"? Does that mean you take care of credit card entry and such? Then say so.)Now give it another go-over, there are still heaps of paragraphs on that page to be improved. Make it shorter (without loosing substance). Emphasize important points with bigger type.Good luck :)

      EA2D - Redwood Shores, CA (SF Bay Area)http://www.ea2d.comWe're a small, autonomous studio within EA building social games for gamers.  Our first monetized title, Dragon Age Legends, is about to enter closed beta and has been generating a lot of buzz (http://pc.ign.com/articles/114/1146553p1.html).Our Platform team is looking for mid to (very) senior engineers. You would be responsible for building the platform on which all EA2D games will run, from the pages that serve the HTML to the suite of game servers supporting them.  Analytics, social network integration, shared services (REST), scaling, real-time stateful and stateless game servers -- this would all be your domain.Our stack is primarily Java with MongoDB on the backend, but we're becoming increasingly polyglot (Python, Ruby) in the middle tier.  We're hosted on EC2 (w/auto-scaling and on-demand environments) and practice continuous deployment.  A sampling of the tech we use: Chef, git (GitHub), Hudson (now Jenkins?), ant, ivy, SQS, S3, EMR, Loggly, PagerDuty, Mixpanel, Kontagent, NginX, Tomcat, Hive, and Google App Engine.  We contribute code back to the open source projects we use, and we've even started open sourcing our own (https://github.com/EA2D).The Platform team is small and young -we're still building out the initial implementations of many services- so you would have a tremendous impact on our architecture and direction.We're a tight-knit team with lots of whiteboards, so you'd need to be on-site.  On the plus side, EA's campus is fantastic - we have a stellar gym, cafeteria, theater, shuttle service to Caltrain, soccer field, volleyball and basketball courts, tournament-quality foosball tables, and much more.Drop me a line if you're interested, mikeb@ea2d.comWe've already hired two people from previous HN "Who's Hiring?" threads, so you'd be in good company!

      San Francisco, CA (SoMa)Early stage, well-funded web startup with SoMa office seeks talented developer as lead engineer. This is a core position; you will have a chance to influence every element of the company's technology, and you will receive a salary, options, and a desk in an office in SoMa.  Must be local.We're keeping our business plan under wraps, but the gist is that we're building a platform that will help local and state governments raise new money from an existing public resource. Read the paper: the time is ripe for this idea, local governments are going bankrupt all over the country. They are desperate for new solutions (see Governor Brown's State of California speech last night), and we will offer them a solution that will raise millions at the local level.If you like novel solutions to hard problems, saving the US from bankruptcy and working at a company with a massive profit potential and an incredibly well-connected advisory board and investor roster, then tell me what you can bring to the table:wallacrw<at>yahoo.com.Must have several years' experience building scalable web applications, with a preference for folks interested in auction theory. You'll have to demonstrate that you can take an idea and implement it from the ground up, and that you can work closely in a small team as a co-founder.

      WOTI (Washington, DC; on site)Ours is a small team of 3 in a company of about 150, on a small but involved ground-up project that's just starting to take on beta users.  It's a web app that pulls together data from many sources and presents an easy-to-navigate graphical summary.  We use mostly Python (2.7) in a Unix environment.  On the back end, we munge a few TB of data using Python, Hadoop and Pig, and some in-house distributed Unix tools.  The processed data goes into Solr/Lucene, is served up by CherryPy and Genshi, and presented by jQuery in IE7, IE8, Firefox 3.5+ and some COTS viz software.  A lot of the job is extracting the juicy bits from various data sources -- e.g., personnel databases and news articles -- then normalizing, aggregating, and indexing it.  The challenge is that it's way too much data for a single system, so we need to parallelize the process on dozens of systems.  We also need to think about how the data is organized to keep search and retrieval fast.  And of course you want an intuitive, powerful front end for all that functionality.A bit about the work environment: we heart open source.  We have nice dual-monitor workstations running RHEL 5 with root; you're free to set up your dev environment how you like (as long as it's secure).  You can be as back-end or front-end as you like, or mix it up.  We all try to do a bit of everything. We have proper sysadmins to help, but end up doing a lot of the server and network configuration ourselves; that way we get it right, plus we kinda like it.  We take security seriously.  Mercurial for version control; Jira for project management; just starting with Scrum for process.  You get a real office with a real window, shared with one person.  The job is a government contract, but in a fairly agile R&D environment (though a startup it ain't).Eight-hour days with a half hour for lunch, whatever hours work for you as long as you're in between 10-3.  Overtime is very rare; no comp time.  There's a basic but serviceable gym and a good walking loop.  It's South of the beltway on the Maryland side, a short commute with no traffic from Alexandria, Arlington, Suitland, or Southeast D.C.  Unfortunately there is no public transportation that comes this way.  Occasional local travel.  Pay is about average for the area.  Benefits and vacation are pretty good.  There are opportunities to move to other projects within the company if you get bored with this one.  And if this particular job ain't your cuppa but you like what you hear generally, drop us a resume anyway; we have several locations in the metro area and are always looking for good people.http://woti.com/jobs.cfm (The "Scripting Genius" posting)
