Google - Madison, WI. Sorry, no remote work, but Google does sponsor visas. All levels of experience welcome. We've recently hired an ACM fellow, as well as a new college grad.Of course Google is hiring. So, why I posting this? Every time I tell someone I'm working at Google in Madison, they're shocked that there's an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison. There's fun technical work in Madison, I promise.I'm working on a hardware/software co-design project that's attacking a fundamentally hard problem, which started as a 20%-time project. There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google's next generation hardware and software platforms. I'm sorry I can't describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.The office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska). Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=45087&https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=2069001&Edit: Interesting to see this downvoted. If you're downvoting this, I'd be curious to know why. Because Madison is in the middle of nowhere and you don't care about Madison? Because you don't like big companies? Because you're cynically trying to push your job post above this one? Because you think job postings need bullet points?
                      
                  
      Just had a recruiter from Google contact me. They do pretty often, once a year. I usually tell them I am not interested. This time the guy mentioned they have some interesting work. So I said ok, I'll talk to him. Set up a time. Waiting for the call. Get an email that he can't make it. Ok, reschedule. Set a new time. Get confirmation he would call. No call, no email not anything.I am thinking WTF. I wasn't even the one interested in the position, is this level of unprofessionalism common with Google?Sorry don't mean to derail the comments, but it just kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. And then seeing Google as first comment on HN hiring, kind of brought that back to my mind.
                      
                  
      Similar experience. Took 4-6 weeks to get a reply to my application email (I'd actually forgotten about it). 4-6 weeks after that (and a few emails from me chasing it up) Google were able to schedule a phone interview. Interviewer was really friendly, and I was pretty excited. Got an email shortly after saying "great that went well, can we fly you to (nearest Google office)". Replied sure - I'm free anytime. 4 weeks later (and a few emails from me chasing it up) and I find out the recruiter has gone on holiday. Another 4 or so weeks later (and more emails from me chasing it up) and I'm told they are having trouble finding someone to interview me for the in-person. Another 2 weeks later I'm finally told the position was filled, but as a promising candidate I should consider applying for other positions.The idea of working at Google is interesting, but I don't really have the months to invest in the interview process.
                      
                  
      A good strategy for getting hired at a big company is to find an internal advocate. It is easy for the Google HR/recruiter to ignore individual candidates, but it is harder for them to ignore you if they get an email from another Google employee asking about the status of your application.How do you find an internal advocate? Start networking. Find people at Google with common interests or backgrounds as you. Then send me a cold email introducing yourself. It will take a few months to develop a relationship where somebody will happily send that email to HR for you, so start a few months before you are planning to submit job applications.
                      
                  
      And at least you were the one who made the first contact. I wasn't even interested to start with, they came to me trying to impress me with new and interesting working going on in that group. I was kind of surprised. For some reason, (and I don't even know why) I expected more from them. Oh well, no need to waste time on them in the future.
                      
                  
      Also similar to mine. Someone called me first time but the phone call was bad and he scheduled a new meeting, but he didn't call me back in the scheduled day. 2 days later he sent me a mail trying to reschedule it. As I was travelling i gave him a new number to call. He called in the first one and sent me a message saying that i wasn't there. I think i sent something like 5 emails later to explain that he called in the wrong number, but he never response me back.
                      
                  
      By any chance can a technical/coding interview be done completely offline?And preferably with more relevant tasks, rather than asking to come up with Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm on the spot, whereas Knuth, Morris and Pratt spent months of researching.
                      
                  
      I didn't downvote you, but "sorry, no remote work" is a comical restriction for this field, especially for a large organization like Google.
                      
                  
      Is your hypothesis that all types of work in "this field" (which, exactly?) spanning all levels of interactivity can be performed equally well by remote workers? I have personal experience that such a hypothesis is demonstrably false, even for pure software projects. I can only imagine how much more so the disconnect would be when the work involves hardware.
                      
                  
      "The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google's next generation hardware and software platforms."Those tasks can and are done by programmers from anywhere. There is absolutely no reason to make them come to an office.
                      
                  
      How the hell do you build hardware remotely?

      If you're doing firmware/software people can just mail you devkits, proto boards.
                      
                  
      devkits and proto boards do have bugs, especially during the early iterations. There are many occasions that I (firmware engineer) need to sit down with FPGA/Hardware engineers to figure out why the system is not performing as designed, sometimes it is firmware issue, sometimes it is hardware, and it was the combination of firmware/hardware and ambient temperature!! It is way more ineffective to perform this kind of debugging with someone in a remote site.
                      
                  
      That could be quite time inefficient, depending on where you live...
                      
                  
      UW-Madison produces a ton of computer engineering talent. Cray, Intel and Nvidia all recruit heavily here. Sadly outside the Google office there aren't many local options for grads so they end up in Texas or California, even when they often want to stay in Madison. I've always thought you guys were genius for having an office in town.
                      
                  
      Is the interview process for working in Madison any less than the ~4 month long nightmare in SV?
                      
                  
      Wisconsin is home to some other interesting tech companies too.  If you're into HPC, Cray has a big presence there.  I think that a lot of job hunters make a mistake by only considering the "startup" scene like Silicon Valley, Boston, etc. when they really are looking for interesting tech jobs not necessarily startup work.
                      
                  
      luu, are you open for applications from abroad, concretely, from Pakistan?
                      
                  
      Does Google-Madison stack-rank like the rest of Google?
                      
                  
      Why is Microsoft all over the blogosphere for stack ranking, but I know dozens of Google folk and this is the first I've heard of it at Google?
                      
                  
      No, one tiny office has a completely different set of HR policies.

      Great resource! I wish I had known about this previously. Can you clarify what is meant by "Top 5 Requested Jobs"?
                      
                  
      Those are the unexpired jobs (posted within the last 60 days) that have been clicked the most frequently.  I could probably tighten up that wording a bit.  :)
                      
                  
      Really like the design of WFH. Great work.

      Notting Hill, London, England, U.K.Our web application is at the heart of our busy e-commerce business; every day it serves millions of product images and handles thousands of purchases - but we can and do update the live site with new code anytime we want without missing a beat. Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalising specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 80 employees and a substantial annual turnover. The firm is growing quickly after a recent investment round.

      TagCmd - London, UK - Full time. Sorry, no work permits, no remote.I am looking for JS developers. We are using Backbone, but experience in Angular, Ember, Knockout or even your own client side framework is as good. We are using a bit of node.js for our fixture server, I guess we can transition a person with that kind of experience too. What really matters is that you know your JS.This is not a startup so no equity, no foosball tables, no free lunches and such...The pay is average for London, too. So what's good about that job? We are running at a marathon pace rather than a sprint. We cleared 2 major milestones last year and no one had worked a minute of overtime. Maybe you are building a business on the side, patio11 style, or maybe you are trying to recover from a failed startup, this job would suit you well. I also try to protect my people from meetings, there are a few guys who like that.I don't really care for CVs, if you have one send it, otherwise tell me what you did with JavaScript in a paragraph or two. Shoot me an email if interested;address in profile.

      So you're making networked mobile robots that can send data back to a central server?
                      
                  
      without confirming or denying anything you said... why central? :)
                      
                  
      On the second hand, as long as I'm in the Bay Area until the end of October, would you want to get together in Mountain View one evening and talk about what your company does?  I can agree to nondisclosure, obviously, and have no noncompetes on my head.
                      
                  
      Because "massively parallel" machines, especially of the kind used for vision or ML processing at large scales, are often centralized.Would that you had an Israeli branch I'd be sending my resume in, but I am not moving to Mountain View.

      Fetchnotes - Cambridge, MA. Interns and full-time. We make your notes and to do lists better, not just better organized.We have a really simple and effective product for keeping track of reminders, ideas, etc., but what I think is really exciting about our business is the R&D we're doing to automate those things or find relevant context/information.For example, you write down a book you want to look up, and we show you where you can find it. You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items. The possibilities are endless, and there's just as much product strategy that needs to be determined there as there is code. But we believe that productivity software can do so much more than empower the procrastination they do today.Looking to add engineers with experience in mobile development (Android in particular), JavaScript (we use Angular, but experience with another framework like Backbone or Ember will suffice), machine learning and natural language processing. As far as NLP goes, we're doing some really unique things that involve more statistics than typical NLP toolkits, so a good stats background will be helpful.Backed by TechStars Boston and a group of fantastic angel investors and venture capitalists, we're a young, close-knit and energetic team of 6 who believe that simple products, engineered properly, can make a big impact on people's lives. We hang out after work frequently, have dinner together at least weekly, and are genuinely friends (not just co-workers). After big releases, we'll usually take the day off to do something fun like laser tag or kayaking. I believe in hiring people that I want to work with over the course of a career, not just for a particular role today. At the end of every interview I ask myself, "In 10 years, will I regret not having had the opportunity to work with this person?"Also, we were #2 on Hacker News last year when we accidentally called 2,000 people bitches: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813Sound interesting?

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Please visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.
                      
                  
      > Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters.Huh?It's in most (if not all) "enterprise" storage stacks.. are you speaking about a specific type of nvram?
                      
                  
      It's now (sort of) available directly.  We can stick an NVDIMM in our server and use it as really fast nonvolatile memory, instead of buying a fancy enterprise storage system (Fusion-io, Violin, etc.) that acts like a disk and may contain any of a number of interesting nonvolatile memory technologies.The price, size, and performance characteristics of non-volatile memory in your server and the various fast disk replacements are very different.
                      
                  
      I was thinking of things like these:http://uk.rs-online.com/web/c/semiconductors/memory-chips/nv...or these more specifically:http://www.amazon.com/NetApp-Server-NVRAM4-111-00023-201-000...So I guess I didn't take your "NVDIMM" usage seriously enough :) Thanks for the explanation.
                      
                  
      Do you have some implicit requirements, like a degree from elite US schools or similar?
                      
                  
      The requirement is that you be very good at the things we need.  There are multiple ways to demonstrate this.
                      
                  
      Well, in that case, I believe you need to be more specific in your job posting at your careers page.

- some support of existing products and systems, bug fixing, enhancements
- few meetingsSo, if you are voracious learner, an initiative taking developer, likes hard stuff, cares about what they build, then we would love to hear from you.Cheers,Adam Webber
                      
                  
      Very interested in this. I am located in Perth, would you consider remote from here?
                      
                  
      I imagine that if they have Darwinites, they can have Perthans.
                      
                  
      Yes, get in touch.
                      
                  
      Counsyl - South San Francisco, CACounsyl is a medical genomics startup in South San Francisco, California. Our goal is to make the human genome practically useful for life-altering decisions.We invented the Counsyl Test, a breakthrough diagnostic intended for parents planning to start a family. It was featured in the New York Times, named one of Scientific Americanâ€™s Top 10 World Changing Ideas, and won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine. Our test is now being used for 12% of all carrier screens in the United States.The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless. The science is there but the scale isnâ€™t. 
Thatâ€™s where Counsyl comes in. We are building the technology platform to make genomics useful and accessible to everyone.The vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python/Django/Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing. Weâ€™re building new tools, new workflows, and new infrastructure to solve the challenging problems of a technology startup involved with not just bits, but also interconnected physical components like lab robotics and patient samples.We're hiring:Software Engineers (https://www.counsyl.com/jobs/software-engineer/)

It's a classic problem of an inefficient market.-------------------------------------------------------The position is for a front-end engineer INTERN (REMOTE is OK).

      Versus - Berlin/Germany - Node.jsTop 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:1. Lowest livings costs with highest quality of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a carâ€”Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and internationalâ€”no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.4. Easy work permissionsâ€”Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, weâ€™d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.Infos on the Node position => http://urge.io/jobs#Node.js%20Growth%20Hacker%20for%20High%2...All job offers => http://urge.io/jobsMail addresse => career <at> urge <dot> io
                      
                  
      > no need to learn German, everyone speaks English!That's only in the startup scene, really. Most tech companies' primary language is still German, and the English proficiency of people you need to interact with in day-to-day things (post office, grocery shopping, etc.) widely varies. Some people (e.g. at the unemployment agency) even outright refuse speaking English.
                      
                  
      I agree. If you want to integrate then prepare to learn to speak German, otherwise you'll only have expat hipster friends.Try the VHS for language learning. It is cheap and worth every cent: http://www.berlin.de/vhs/

You don't identify with specific technologies as much as you identify with the problems that need to be solved.Ideally, though not required, you have some experience with distributed database systems (cassandra, hadoop, hbase, etc.), security (HIPAA), and generally get excited about data, sensors, health, and how we can combine them to make people healthy at scale.We are based in Palo Alto, California - the right candidate can work remotely for a time period, though we would like to get the whole team under the same roof soon.Come help us build the human health data infrastructure layer.To apply, send an email directly to andrei@humanapi.co with your background, some relevant links (github, linkedin, etc), and any questions you have :)

      I was going to email you, but I feel that it would be beneficial to other job seekers if I posted here instead. This is a rather vague listing, and I don't think there's any way I would apply without a few key questions being answered.â€¢ Can you be any more specific about the nature of your target market? If not, what prevents you from discussing it?â€¢ How can I verify that the company is "highly experienced in its target market and ... has a proven track record of success", given the absence of a website or any discernable press?â€¢ When you say that you're "building a flourishing and lucrative business" and that your "results driven team ... build[s] successful products", is this a reflection of the company's actual status or just its hopes?If you actually value "clear and effective communication", you might consider a full rewrite of this job posting with honest details.

That statement of fast growth might sound cliched, but our revenues grew by 210% (yes!) last month and we have a ton of enterprise deals in the pipeline to keep up that momentum.Meanwhile, we also launched a new product (hackerrank.com) to create a community of programmers in different domains of Computer Science - AI, ML, Image processing, security, etc. The aim is to build a place to get every problem solver in the world and add an engaging layer on the top - contests, jobs, prizes, office hours (Eg: hackerrank.com/quora) from companies who are our customers already.2 years from now you can imagine us to be in a position to have 20-30k technology companies using our recruit product and 100-150k active programmers on hackerrank making it effectively a hugely powerful platform to connect programmers with right opportunities (jobs, contests, cash prizes to solve real-world problems, learning a new domain, inventing a new technique to solve a problem and many more) in the fastest way. And when this happens, it will help ship products faster thus accelerating the pace of the world.It's a tough mission ahead but we are all geared up. Everyone is so passionate and hardworking that sometimes from an external view, you might find it hard to differentiate a founder from an employee.Both the products are built by the same team and we are hiring for all the roles - PM, hacker, sales, marketing (hackerrank.com/careers)E-mail me: vivek [at] interviewstreet (or) vivek [at] hackerrank if you'd like to know more.

team@piethis.comMore About PiePie is a knowledge management tool that people will actually use.Our goal is to make Pie the best tool for professionals to securely share, collect and curate knowledge. We're doing this by making Pie as visual and intuitive as possible. We're data-driven and we believe a strong developer culture is vital for building the most valuable product for our users.The founding team of Pie is not new to building, scaling and exiting startups. Thijs has previously built and sold a contextual search venture to Mozilla.

We've also got NEO.com as one of our shareholders (which is highly unusual for them).We've been overwhelmed with the positive feedback we got from the 350+ pilot companies that signed-up for our early Beta.

      As far as I know, a work permission is quite easy to get for Singapore. So could you please explain why you can't sponsor relocation costs? If you mean that you can't afford to buy an airplane ticket, then things aren't really going good in your company.

      New York - Intern - ff Venture CapitalWe are an early-stage venture capital fund based in midtown Manhattan and are seeking CS interns. We have projects in Django, Rails and Node.+ You will have ownership of your own projects and manage them from start to finish+ Interact and learn from venture capitalists and entrepreneurs+ Get to know the New York startup community+ Work directly underneath our Director of Engineeringhttp://ffventure.theresumator.com/apply/gD5JAH/Venture-Capit...
                      
                  
      Your compensation is minimum wage. That is extremely unappealing to the kind of talented people you are seeking. I strongly urge you to reconsider.
                      
                  
      I am a CS student who interned last summer for a typical megacorporation and I made around $20 an hour... and I barely have any of those required skills. I just wanted to point out that you guys, especially at a venture capital firm, are not going to get many people to apply if you continue to lowball them like that.
                      
                  
      $7.25/hour, nice!!
                      
                  
      You want a self-starter who's passionate about your vision and willing to work for (you've now erased it) minimum wage?Typical capitalist idiocy.
                      
                  
      Is this a joke?
