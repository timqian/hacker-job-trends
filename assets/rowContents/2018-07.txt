      Render | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineers | Full-time | Visa | OnsiteWhen deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and Postgres, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for people with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.We're serving live applications in production and building out our founding engineering and design teams in SF. The company is backed by top venture funds and former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox.I'm the founder and would love to hear from you at anurag@render.com.

      Flatiron School (now part of WeWork) | Software Engineers, esp. Seniors | New York, NY (NYC) | ONSITE | FULL-TIMEHi, I'm the Engineering Director on the Product/Engineering team at the Flatiron School. I joined the team about four months ago as part of a general scaling up of the team (we're currently about 25 devs and growing) and love it. We mostly work on Learn, a modern Learning Management System that runs the school's online coding bootcamps. This place is an unusually kind and nurturing place, and we have a mission that we believe in. A number of the developers originally went through the Flatiron School, so the level of knowledge and empathy with users is unusually high.We're looking for developers with a wide range of backgrounds, especially people with a few years under their belts and an interest in mentoring less-experienced developers. We value diversity of all kinds and would love to benefit from having many perspectives. I can speak from my own experience as a parent that it's a family-friendly place with pretty good core hours, flexibility around timing, good health benefits, friendliness toward dialing in (though we generally prefer to work together in-person) and just a generally nice vibe.As far as the tech stack goes, we mostly use Ruby/Rails, Elixir/Phoenix and Javascript/React and we're moving to AWS. I wouldn't get too hung up on having all of these particular items on your resume. What's most important to me is having some ways of solving problems collaboratively on a team. There's all kinds of cool problems to work on here as we scale our user base, course offerings, team and our infrastructure, and there will be plenty of new problems that will require adaptability, openness and an ability to communicate.We have some job listings at https://flatironschool.com/careers/, but if you're interested in finding out more, applying or just want to chat, please drop me a line at paul@flatironschool.com.

      Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://knotel.comKnotel is a fast growing real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to sove.We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.Today we're hiring a Data Engineer https://grnh.se/d5c41fd31
And a Lead Site Reliability Engineer https://grnh.se/e43371b81

The phrase that most aptly describes us is â€œboutique consulting firmâ€� as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.

We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.https://www.builtforme.techhttps://blog.builtforme.techApply via AngelList: https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/
