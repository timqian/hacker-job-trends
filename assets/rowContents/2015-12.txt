      Y Combinator is hiring hackers (San Francisco, ONSITE)We have a small team that makes the software that runs YC. Hardly any investors write software, but YC was started by hackers so it's natural for us to solve our problems that way.The YC software is used by a relatively small number of peopleâ€”mostly the YC partners and foundersâ€”but the users are sufficiently important that through them we are able to have huge leverage. YC has ambitious plans to create more innovation in the world, and the only way to reach that level of impact is to scale through software.We're looking for a couple of great hackers to join us. It's not a job for everyone, but it could be a good fit for someone who likes startups.  If you're a hacker, have a look at the job description: https://jobs.lever.co/ycombinator/8703c1d9-af67-4826-90e4-74.... If it feels like a good fit, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

      Global, REMOTE only, full/part time/interns.I am running a small consulting operation with clients in Australia and South East Asia.Right now, I am signing up new data consulting clients (including a big one in February 2016) and need some help. This involves running AWS instances, figuring out APIs, building a PostgreSQL data warehouse, and finally building various machine learning products from recommendation engines to using multivariate statistics to improve their understanding of their business. The latter part is the fun one but anybody who has done this will know 90% of the work is in the data warehouse.I write some of the code but I mostly spend my time dealing with the clients and writing the functional specs for you.You should be familiar with relational algebra and relational databases.  I recommend having a good knowledge of the topics covered in "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).  Most of our recent projects have been done with Haskell, Postgres and some bash.You can usually name your price (per week), worst case the client will say no. Clients are all OK with never meeting you in person (in fact, my first client still hasnâ€™t met me).If interested, please get in touch - email is in my profile. You can expect some technical discussion and potentially a little programming test.  If you can, please point to some public code you've written.

  * Product manager

  * Content writers

  * Designers

meanpath crawls 200 million websites and compiles reports on the technology these sites are using. We currently track over 9,000 different bits of tech which sometimes gets picked up in the press http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/bootstrap-3-goes-mobile-fir...Most of our customers consume this information via our API but we are going to start work on creating a front end so non-technical users can access the information easily. We are entirely bootstrapped and profitable. CTO is based in Ann Arbor, MI and CEO (me) is based in Sydney, Australia. We have a huge team of researchers in Manila who compile and enhance the reports.Visas?:We have both US and Australian corporate entities so can sponsor or transfer visas in both countries.

      They reject people for debatable reasons such as "communication skills." Don't apply here.
                      
                  
      How is this a debatable reason? If they have you working for a client, and you can't communicate with the client effectively, that's a completely valid reason for rejection.Full disclosure: Former employee of Metova, and I had an absolutely fantastic experience with them.
                      
                  
      It's debatable if one has "good communication skills" or not. This is what I'm saying. If you talk to someone different they would have a completely different viewpoint on your "skills." Nothing objective in that. Plus, you can't really judge how well you talk with a client in an interview since the interviewer is not a client of the company.

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco, CA - onsiteRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after three years, weâ€™re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 48,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of 85 (37 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers and engineering managers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out our recent press here:

The algorithms are typically developed on a Windows architecture but scale out to many Linux-based instances for deployment.  These algorithms integrate with a full stack web environment running in F#, a functional-first, multiparadigm language, which is deployed to a Microsoft Azure deployment environment. Both environments operate in parallel. We seek engineers who are excited to work on dynamic allocation of computation resources, efficient operations, and cloud-scale operations.Correctness (QA) EngineerThe Tachyus Correctness Engineer is a Software Engineer who specializes in building the infrastructure to prove our software and algorithms produce accurate results. The CE works closely with the Software and Science organizations to prevent, catch, prioritize and eliminate errors in both software and data. Correctness Engineering is also intimately involved in continuous Integration and release management. He or she is an engineer at heart, preferably with experience writing production code.

      Planet Labs -- http://planet.com/ -- San Francisco, CA(Remote work depends on the role -- some are onsite only, others may be available to remote workers. Internships available as well.)Planet Labs has a large number of positions open. We're a collection of electrical, mechanical, aerospace, software, science, etc. folks looking to image the whole planet on a daily basis with a large number of small satellites. It's a terrific bunch of folks doing what we call "agile aerospace".I've personally been with the company for over a year, working on "Mission Control", an internal web app for managing the satellites and make life easier on our "Spaceship Captains" -- the operators who manage them. This is definitely one of the most interesting and fun roles I've had in my career (and I've had a few).Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects. We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software. Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, dev ops, site reliability engineers, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we're growing.Full list of jobs at https://www.planet.com/careers/#openings
                      
                  
      I checked out a bunch of openings and none of them mention r3mot3
                      
                  
      It depends on the role.  Obviously one where you need direct hands-on access to the satellites in the lab is unlikely, but software or other functions that can be done from anywhere are fair game.  We have a fair number of people who are remote, and we go to great lengths to cater to them.  Case in point -- I'm working from home today (my throat is a little scratchy) and I'm tuned into a talk that one of my coworkers (and former NASA employee) is giving his analysis on the question "Is space hard?" given the recent failures of various rockets (two of which we had satellites on).  Just in time to get us all nervous about the launch scheduled for tomorrow:https://www.planet.com/pulse/flock2e/Other than that, there are limitations in some cases depending on the role based on compliance and security restrictions -- some things have to be done in the US.  We also have offices in Lethbridge, Canada and Berlin, Germany.  We want talented people -- if there isn't something about the role that presents a limiting factor, we're certainly open to remote.
                      
                  
      Compose (IBM) | REMOTE (US, UK, CA)Developing software appeals to those who love to solve puzzles and apply their brain power -- and also to those, in our experience, who like working from home in their pyjamas. It is often said that one of the trickiest accomplishments in the development world is imagining, building and maintaining a complex and interconnected mental model of your entire infrastructure within your working memory. If you have experience applying this mental feat within some type of Software-as-a-Service, we have a tremendous challenge for you and a terrific team willing and able to support you through it.* Work from anywhere! As long as you're legally able to work in the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom.* Completely flat, open culture.* Ruby/Go.* Fantastic salary and benefits.Our hiring process is nifty. We request a work-sample upfront that closely resembles the work you'd be doing within your role.

      That's fair. If you believe that you meet enough of the other requirements then don't hesitate to apply.

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how "identical" reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility. You'll have an opportunity to do original research with internal capacity, too.We're a rapidly growing startup, now 30-something people, well funded ($15M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.We're looking for talented engineers and bioengineers to join our team. You'll have competitive salary and benefits, subsidized commuting, free caffeine and food, and great teammates.Recent coverage: http://learn.transcriptic.com/press/

      Medallia - Palo Alto, CA - http://engineering.medallia.comMedallia is looking to expand its mobile team. Among other positions we are looking for an iOS developer that can drive our product and code base to a totally new level.World-class companies (Apple, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences. Our platform already includes a mobile solution covering both Android and iOS users, providing them the ability to engage with customers in real-time, share aggregated data, or analyze customer feedback on-the-go.
We want to take this platform to the next stage, by increasing the social aspect of our application to make it a vital part of our client's organization, and by increasing its the personalization capabilities, so each one of our users can tailor it to their particular needs and goals. We also want to experiment on innovative ways of capturing customer experience information, and on helping companies to engage their employees on a customer oriented culture.For that we've started experimenting with new frameworks and technologies such React Native, Flux and Graph QL in order to make our development more agile and extensible, given that we don't need to recompile every time after a change, that we can have a server with the app's content so we don't have to wait for apples review and that we can reuse existing javascript libraries that work great.Please contact me at jmrodriguez@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.Juan Manuel Rodriguez, iOS Software Engineer.
