-= MATASANO SECURITY =-
Chicago. New York City. Sunnyvale.
Application Security ConsultantFull-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.The start of a new year is a time many people become a bit introspective and reflect on their lives and careers.  Those of us who enjoy what we do, and find satisfaction in our work take account of our accomplishments and achievements in the past year.  Others may be less satisfied with their current position, and resolve to improve it.  If you find yourself in the latter camp, my advice is to find a job for which you are passionate, motivated, and talented.  Find your muse; something which engages your heart and mind, and gives you a sense a fulfillment.For those of us at Matasano Security, this sense of pride and accomplishment comes from assessing the security of application software.  We find few things as inately satisfying as discovering ways to abuse application logic and bend it to our will.  Better yet is the satisfaction that comes with knowing our clients can now use our information to secure their applications and protect their clients. It takes meticulous attention to detail, and the ability to think outside the box and consider cases the application's own developers didn't.  Application Security can be both an intriguing mental puzzle, and an extreme adrenaline rush in a way few disciplines of computing are.In the coming weeks, gyms will fill up with new members intent on exercising their bodies.  Me?  I'll continue soldiering on, breaking and helping fix software, exercising my heart and mind.  If you'd like to join me, check out matasano.com/careers and contact us at careers@matasano.com.
                      
                  
      I've read much of Matasano's work and would love to join.  Are you truly "always hiring", or would you recommend starting a dialogue sooner rather than later?I promised myself that I wouldn't apply/interview until I get the OSCP out of the way this month, but would hate to watch a good opportunity slip away.
                      
                  
      Yes, we are really always hiring.  Don't feel like this any particular bar you need to reach; you can't waste our time.  We interview all sorts of people with all sorts of backgrounds.  Some fit, some don't, but not neceessarily the one's you'd think.We also have a history of interiewing the same person repeatedly.  I myself interviewed twice before I came to Matasano.  There's nothing wrong with realizing it's not a good fit at this time, and coming back around at a later date.  Seriously, you can't waste our time.
                      
                  
      Good to know - thanks.I was mostly just asking because of my own time constraints until the end of this month.  Either way, I will definitely reach out to you by February!
                      
                  
      How does Matasano feel about candidates having or not having university degrees?
                      
                  
      We're far more concerned about a candidate's ability and flexibility to adapt and learn than degrees, certifications, etc.Some of our employees hold PHDs and/or Masters degrees, others (like me) don't even have a Bachelors.
                      
                  
      Matasano pays no attention to university degrees at all.
                      
                  
      Hi!This caught my interest, and I sent of an e-mail to you on Sunday. I understand that people may be busy catching up on e-mails from the holidays and everything, but it's now Thursday and I would have expected at least an acknowledgement of receiving my e-mail by now. :)Maybe the mail has gotten lost somewhere?

      I love Buffer, if I didn't already have a start up I'd certainly work for buffer, if they'd have me.
                      
                  
      That's awesome to hear, thanks!

      Counterparty - REMOTE - http://counterparty.ioCounterparty is a freely licensed and open-source platform for peer-to-peer finance that lives on the Bitcoin blockchain. The network has been live since January, and it has seen over 130k transactions since then.[1] Overstock.com recently announced that it would be building the world's first SEC-regulated stock market for cryptosecurities on our platform.[2]The non-profit Counterparty Foundation is hiring a developer to join a team of two (myself and one other) dedicated to further developing the Counterparty Protocol and software ecosystem (e.g. wallet software, block explorers). Experience with Python is strongly preferred, as much of the work will be with the protocol's reference implementation, counterpartyd.[3]It goes without saying that this is an unconventional position requiring a great deal of independence, self-direction and creativity. More details about the position: http://counterparty.io/jobsContact: adamk@counterparty.ioWeb Wallet: https://counterwallet.io[1] - https://blockscan.com[2] - http://www.coindesk.com/overstock-hires-counterparty-develop....[3] - https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd
                      
                  
      Open-source decentralized financial software is a really amazing phenomenon of our era
                      
                  
      I clicked on Team and there're no engineers there. Does the company not value their engineers?
                      
                  
      One of their job descriptions says that the only two full-time engineers are the co-founder (Adam) and product development (Ouziel).
                      
                  
      Freedom of the Press Foundation https://freedom.press -- DevOps EngineerFull-time, Bay Area local preferred but remote possible for exceptional candidates.We develop SecureDrop, an open source whistleblower submission system. SecureDrop is currently used in over 15 major newsrooms, including those of the Washington Post, the Guardian, the New Yorker, and ProPublica. [0]One of our big challenges moving forward is scaling. For legal and security reasons, we require every organization to deploy their own SecureDrop instance on dedicated hardware. We do not offer SecureDrop "as a service". As a result, traditional scaling techniques do not apply. However, we believe that by automating the testing, development, deployment, and troubleshooting of SecureDrop systems, we can continue to support a growing base of SecureDrop installs without becoming overwhelmed. That's where you come in :)For more information on the job, see our full job description, which includes instructions for applying: https://freedom.press/jobs/job-opening-devops-engineer-secur...[0] https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory
                      
                  
      London UK - Osper - http://osper.comWe provide a real prepaid debit card for young people, aged 8-18, so they can make independent decisions with money: online, in shops, at cash machines, & abroad. Thousands of kids have already signed up to our service.But we not only help young people buy Legos and save for bicycles - we are building an awesome technology team that eliminates legacy code, keeps the bug rate tiny, and stays small & joyful. We are doing this by adopting techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, continuous deployment, and microservices. You can read more about our plan to be awesome on our tech blog http://tech.osper.io.
We want to meet and work with smart technical folks of all varieties - from server-side devs to sysadmins, mobile coders to testers, security analysts to data crunchers - but especially front-end experts who like mobile app development of any kind (we happen to use PhoneGap/Cordova but don't expect candidates to know this framework).We are willing to arrange relocation to London for the right candidate. Sorry, we're not ready to take on remote team members at this stage.
                      
                  
      Can really vouch for Osper - what Squirrel and the team have built so far is technically excellent, with much more to come. Also, all incredibly nice people to work with. Well worth a chat.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the kind words Andy!
                      
                  
      I've always was hesitative in moving to London. Totally unrelated question to this offer. Can you live in London on developers pay on the same standard as in Bristol?I'm a foreigner and until now I lived only in South Wales and Bristol.
                      
                  
      Nice to hear from you hueking. Don't have any direct experience with Bristol but I know developers who have moved from there to London and had a good experience, with cost of living offset by a proportionally higher salary and a wide variety of neighbourhoods in London to choose from. Feel free to get in touch (see my profile for email) if you are interested in exploring further.

      San Francisco - PlanGrid (YC12). Near 16th Street Mission BART. VISA, INTERN, FULL-TIME.We sell an actual useful product for money (think version control for blueprints but our ambitions are much larger). We intend to own the construction software business, which is vastly under-served. The market is huge; construction is a multi-trillion dollar industry globally that still operates like they did in 1950. Our customers are so happy that up until the past three months we've had no marketing or sales whatsoever - we were profitable in year one just from word of mouth.Our primary hiring philosophy is as follows: Wicked smart, NO DICKS.We are looking for engineering and non-engineering positions.  You can see the jobs and/or apply here: http://grnh.se/r1nhcp* Senior iOS. We are shipping Swift code this month (see my Swift blog at http://russbishop.net ).* Android. Small but growing team.* Backend/API. Python and mongo, but we're investigating alternatives (Postgres? FoundationDB?) because we are steam-rolling to the trillion-with-a-capital-T mark on records.* Windows. We are just starting this team so you have complete freedom. Will probably be C# with a shared library supporting a Desktop app and RT app.* Data Science. You would think blueprints were created by professionals with standards. You'd be wrong. Put your machine learning skills to work on real world problems where a 1% improvement saves man-years of effort.* Web. We do some real magic on the web; check out our blueprint annotating.

      Weft - http://weft.io - Cambridge/Boston, MA (office is in central sq.)   ===========================
   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================

We're the single source of truth in logistics -- we track every boat on the water, every plane in the sky, and every truck on the ground so that we can know everything that's going on in the logistics world. We do a lot of analysis and optimization, too. Weâ€™re working in the largest, least sexy, most invisible industry in the world â€” 90% of everything has been on a ship at one point in time.The problem -> Lots of inefficiencies in the supply chain! One of our customers spends $400mm/year shipping empty containers, another spends $80mm/year on late fees. Lots to optimize!How we fix it -> We track everything in the supply chain and make predictions and recommendations as to what our customers should do!   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================

Web/data stack -> clojure + postgres/cassandra/redis/rabbit + ruby on rails + hadoop/EMR (weâ€™re a SOA shop)Mobile -> iOS, android, mobile webAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from CPG companies and telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors (a16z, atlas)!Looking for:- A growth hacker- Data science folks- Data engineering folks- Generalists- Master front-end devsIf this sounds interesting, please shoot us an email at mike@weft.io!

      Can we please move this thread to tomorrow (or even Monday next week)? Today it will get missed by a lot of people because almost all offices are closed.
                      
                  
      whoishiring bot here. I agree that it would be far better to post these only on business days.But if these posts don't show up on time on the first of the month, others will post them and they will be upvoted. Moderators would have to kill loads of posts until the appointed time.Moving the thread is definitely a solvable problem, but I'm not sure that it is worth the extra moderation work. Furthermore, neither your whoishiring bot or its caretaker is a moderator.
                      
                  
      You know, I was thinking about this before I saw these comments and I did think "maybe it would be better if Who Is Hiring 1/15 was posted on Monday cos fewer users will see it", but then I thought about it some more and changed my mind. I now think that it's OK and you should just leave it and not do anything else.The reason why is because HN WIH has now gotten to the point where it's a regular feature and people expect it, like clockwork. I think folks who check in on Monday who read it every month will find it and upvote it anyway. This isn't a strongly held opinion, though.
                      
                  
      Just re-post tomorrow?
                      
                  
      I don't think many software developers or hiring mangers will be working tomorrow either.
                      
                  
      Maybe we can simply re-start the thread tomorrow. I don't think it has any special "power" compared to usual threads :)
                      
                  
      It seems today almost nobody will be working, but the majority of people will be out of office on Friday too.
                      
                  
      Perhaps `dang can bump this back to the front page on Monday.

      Northeastern University (CCIS) | Boston | Software EngineerThe programmer will help deploy a scalable, robust distributed system called Reverse Traceroute.[1] This project has received funding both from industry and the National Science Foundation, as well as winning research awards.While the standard traceroute tool is popular for Internet troubleshooting and diagnostics, it only measures the path to the destination, not the path back, leaving network operators blind to half their route. Reverse traceroute addresses this limitation, measuring Internet paths from arbitrary destination hosts toward a given source host.The prototype and subsequent iterations of the system were sufficient for small-scale experiments but not terribly robust or scalable. The programmer will design a new implementation that is efficient, scalable and self-managing to ensure high availability. This system will also provide a public API that allows the community of researchers, operators and other practitioners to issue measurements and receive results.This position is in a unique research environment, where the programmer will work on new and interesting problems and advance the state of the art. This is a full-time position with benefits and salary competitive with industry.

      Germany/Netherlands - REMOTE - Apply at http://nlcollect-bv.workable.com/jobs/7652ClubCollect has created a service for sports clubs and other organizations to make invoicing of club members a breeze. Invoicing, reminding, online payments: everything is processed via ClubCollect. Since we're entering the German market we're looking for a developer who is proficient in German (speaking & writing). Reason: ability to discuss API interfaces with German developers of external accounting systems and perfecting the localization of ClubCollect.We're a small team (just eight people), we love remote working but we also like to get together for beers and a great dinner.ClubCollect is built in Ruby (+ Ruby on Rails) and JavaScript (+ jQuery). We value simplicity, creative solutions, and the ability to get things done. You will have the opportunity to contribute to all areas of our code base.- B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent experience (proven ability matters more to us than degrees)
- Fluent in at least one dynamically-typed, object-oriented language (e.g. Ruby, Python)
- Several years experience with a modern web framework such as Rails or Django@recruiters: please don't contact us, we're not interested.
                      
                  
      lol, the german post is the only one mentioning a degree.
                      
                  
      It's a good thing strict CS degree requirement is dying down. Hopefully we'd reach a time where companies automate how they find a fitting candidate. This is how I envision the system:* A test on the core technologies, programming languages and paradigms the company uses.* Test can be taken over a period of time, say 6 months maximum.* The system is able to recommend questions that really identifies people good at a particular thing.* The system is able to recommend books and other resources for job applicants.* As an applicant, starting a test is only a declaration of intent to work at a certain company or related (in terms of core tech, etc) ones.Maybe there are products like that already or are in the making. It'd be a more useful job application process. Otherwise I'd be happy to join anyone build it.
                      
                  
      To clarify, I think a degree requirement is a bad thing, even if I have one.Even if it isn't mandatory, since a person without a degree may not know what a specific degree implies.

      I emailed castAR last month asking about positions in hardware/embedded dev for new grads, but I didn't hear anything back. I tried both careers@ and jobs@ email addresses.
                      
                  
      We changed how we handle incoming mail (some of it was unwittingly ending up in a bit bucket) could you try again?  I intend that everyone get a response.  Sorry!

      Proactive Computing -- Los Altos, CA / RemoteHiring: DevOps, Backend, and full-stack engineers.Our stack: AWS, Python, CToday, computing is reactive. Users pull out their phone or laptop and start from scratch with an empty search box or a screen of apps. There is no context for the task at hand, and no history of the user's preferences. It won't be this way for long, your computer has an incredible volume of data about you stored in email and in calendar so a world where this rich context is put to use is inevitable. We are doing just this -- building rich user profiles and analyzing the tasks each user needs to accomplish in real time -- so that when a user pulls out their phone, they are proactively presented with personalized solutions.We are moving from a world where computers are tools people engage, to a world where computers proactively engage users with targeted decisions -- simplifying and automating life's daily tasks. This is a categorical shift in how we use computers and we have found early traction and growth via converting daily tasks into actions through large scale data processing of users email and calendar data.Contact: wferrell AT weldai.com

* Backend Software Engineer (python) 
* Data Engineer 
* Data ScientistWe're a seed funded startup - 3 former Googlers - and we're tackling the messy world of business. Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're changing that. It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here's our team's take on the space: https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567 Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don't mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we're in. We've had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it. You'd be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together. For our data roles, we prefer Python. Graph-specific data experience is a bonus.Email falon@close.co
