      Hi there,Do you offer visa sponsorship for international applicants? I graduated from Duke with a CS degree, have worked at both Google and IBM (where I wrote primarily in Golang), and would really be interested in a software engineer distributed systems role at Cockroach labs.
                      
                  
      Hi! Please reach out to info@cockroachlabs.com and put Head of People Operations in the subject line. I can learn more about your visa situation and see if we can accommodate!
                      
                  
      FYI: The H1B cap for current year has already been reachedhttp://blog.mygcvisa.com/2017/04/uscis-reaches-fy-2018-h-1b-...The earliest a person can apply for H1B and start working would be Oct 2018.
                      
                  
      Since (s)he graduated from Duke and worked with Google in golang (relatively recent), very likely that (s)he is either on STEM OPT or already have H1b.Also, that's a very odd use for a throwaway account.
                      
                  
      Pretty cool. Are you hiring interns too ?

      I always want to use this but find too many false positives. Is there a way to flag something for your attention? Mostly my issues have been finding jobs near me only to click and find that it's been matched to the wrong location.
                      
                  
      This sounds like a really good feature to have. I will try to build something to flag "broken" jobs.
                      
                  
      For example, right now there are 7 jobs displayed in Martinez, CA on the map, but which are really in Mountain View, CA.
                      
                  
      What about multiple locations? I started my post with this:"Southeast USA including: Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), South Carolina (Greenville), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), and possibly others, all ONSITE."Currently you have me as Austin. That is just 1 of 8 locations. I don't really see how I could fix this. We actually are hiring multiple people at multiple sites. I suppose I could post 8 times, but they'd probably get marked as dupe posts due to being identical except for the location.
                      
                  
      I think I get it. I didn't want to stretch HN formatting too much, but since this was raised before, looks like a real issue. My thoughs:- We could extend the locations format to comma separated values. Although some people will use "London, UK" or "Philadelphia, PA" so comma doesn't look like a good idea.- use ";" instead of ",' to separate values eg. " ... Lead Engineer | London, UK; Philadelphia, PA | ... "Other ideas welcome.
                      
                  
      Be looser. Grab every location you see, or at least until you hit a sentence without a location. That means city, state, and country.Next, look for geographic nesting. If you see Moscow and Maine, it isn't Russia. If you see Georgia and Tbilisi, it isn't the USA. If you see Melbourne and Florida, it isn't Australia. Country codes and state codes may conflict, so try both ways. The larger area may come first or second. For example: "Austin, TX" or "We're a Texas company in Austin, Houston, and Dallas."If you are left with a geographic region that is larger than a city, log the problem and investigate. Note that DC (also "D.C.") and Vatican City are tiny, so they are OK as is.See what you can do about stuff like NOVA (Northern Virginia), Research Triangle, Twin Cities, Cape Cod, beltway (probably around DC), and Bay Area. Maybe they are small enough. Hawaii might go by island name.
                      
                  
      Hi, is there a problem with the location? I put "Bangkok" and the post in whoishiring is showing in "Orlando, FL"
I just changed to "Bangkok, TH", hopefully this will help. Does the scraping update the posts when there is a difference found?
                      
                  
      How often do you scrape the thread ?
                      
                  
      Every 20 minutes from https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/. Sometimes update delays could be caused by HN to firebase push (which happens every X interval as well)
                      
                  
      Thanks, strangely I can't see my posting on your site (posted around noon PST on the 1st. The posting is for ZestFinance (Sr. Devops Engineer).Might be related to the Firebase API failures...

      I live in Montreal and had an initial interview with the Montreal office several months ago. I was looking for flexible work, specifically the ability to work remotely. I was told it was not really an option, and that I would be required to work in the office most of the time. As a result, it didn't work out for me. I see that you are listing remote work as a possibility. Has your policy changed in that regard?
                      
                  
      There are a select few remote positions, in R&D thats mainly in the Data Stores team. Customer support and Merchant Success have remote positions too.

https://jobs.lever.co/shopify/af6eb818-fe8b-433c-ba5b-d198ef...winter positions will be posted shortly.We work with interns to figure out what exact department they will finally land in through the interview process.
                      
                  
      Will there be internships in SF during Fall/Winter?
                      
                  
      Former intern here: they don't do SF internships as far as I know. The office is made of <10 engineers and can't support an internship program.
                      
                  
      For now all the internships are in Canada, but we pay for relocation and housing during the course of the internship.

      Hey HN! I'm an Android engineer on the mobile growth team and we're looking to grow our team with another Android engineer (the second role called out above). Right now there are 4 of us on Android (5 on iOS), working on a variety of projects related to sharing, referrals, push notifications, onboarding, login, signup, internationalization, and more! There's two key things I love about the growth team - First, the ability to experiment on any idea I think might improve our product, and second, the ability to collaborate widely across the company on my projects. Even as a new grad new hire (~9 months on the job and right out of college), I was able to go from proposing an idea, formulating a hypothesis and test plan, to then rolling out the change because I was able to prove out the value with experimentation. And across the different things I've worked on I've gotten to work with our messaging team, trust team, trips team, and search team, to name a few. If you like driving your own projects, and collaborating with incredibly smart people, I want you on my team now!If you've got any further specific questions about this position or Airbnb generally, feel free to email me (check my profile)!

      Other than socialized healthcare, does Montreal have a lower cost of living to offset a 95k CAD salary for a senior developer?
                      
                  
      The housing is probably the lowest you'll find in a large city in Canada, but the taxes are some of the highest so it evens out. 95k in Montreal should go furthur the it would in Toronto or Vancouver.
                      
                  
      housing is really cheap in montreal as well.
average dev salary is about 70k - 100k

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsiteRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out one of our product releases here: https://clever.com/products/badges

      Is this US only remote ? Or you can consider remote engineers from other countries?
                      
                  
      From their open positions list, it looks like it's US-only.

Please have â€œ[your name] - Regional Head of Data - HNâ€� as the subject line.Technical QuestionsHere (http://i.imgur.com/ImdVZBI.png) is a simplified model of the systems used by a fictional online retailer. Their three systems track the flow of an order placed on their website, through their warehouse, and to the point of delivery. Each system uses its own database (MySQL for the shop, PostgreSQL for the warehouse, etc.). The systems communicate to each other via API calls (that are not shown here).Please review the model and be prepared to discuss it with us. When we talk, we'll ask you how you would answer queries about this fictional business. These will be high-level questions and not deeply technical. We'll also want to hear your opinion of the model, its limitations, and how it could be improved.1. Write a query to count the number of products across all orders received by the warehouse system today (the PostgreSQL database).2. Given an order_id, how would you find its last GPS coordinates?3. What do you think is the most serious problem among these systems, and why? (We are not looking for a specific answer, we want to know what you think is a problem.)4. Why do you think this fictional company chose Redis for their delivery system, and is it a good choice?

      Cloudera | Engineering (& More) | Onsite | GloballyCloudera was founded in 2008 to help businesses capture, store and analyze that data. We built a software platform that can handle the huge amounts of data now available. We developed a powerful collection of processing and analytic capabilities. Our customers are able to ask very deep questions of their data, and get their answers quickly.From the beginning, we recognized that data could drive social, as well as commercial, value. For example:* Producing and distributing clean energy is easier and cheaper if we can instrument wind farms, solar collectors and transmission networks, and continuously optimize them.
* There are seven billion people in the world today, but the population will grow to nine billion by the year 2050. We must feed two billion more people but wonâ€™t find much new arable farmland. If we can analyze data on soil chemistry, model weather accurately and select the varieties of seeds best suited to produce in those conditions, we can increase crop yields.
* Genetic analysis, both of patients and of the diseases that afflict them, provides a rich toolbox for interfering with disease onset and progression, and offers the hope of designing new drugs that can cure many varieties of cancer in our lifetimes.Cloudera was also started "because we believe that data makes things that are impossible today, possible tomorrow. Thereâ€™s more data coming, and there are plenty of impossible things to work on. Our journey is only well begun." ~Mike Olson, Cloudera CSOIf you would like to join us on this exciting journey, check out the possibilities on our website-"There are plenty of impossible things still to be done."To learn more & apply for our current openings in the US, Asia-Pacific, Latin America,and Europe/Middle East/Africa, check us out here https://goo.gl/Pm87Mj

      I'm going to ask that we require a base salary in all posts on this thread. The lowest someone is going to get paid to do this job is: ______Do we value HN enough as an audience to require this?Edit: It feels like this monthly thing is starting to take off and it's time to add some barriers to entry. I hesitate to say "downvote if they don't have salary info" without official blessing but this is such a waste of time without it. I mean even I will upvote Apple showing up w/out salary but few companies can pull that off.
                      
                  
      > I hesitate to say "downvote if they don't have salary info"Upvoting the listings that include salary will provide enough positive reinforcement as those float to the top IMO.
                      
                  
      I agree; but this process takes a while (perhaps doesn't start happening 'til the evening?) & I feel like it often doesn't begin without some sort of reminder/encouragement.In the grand scheme of things I'm personally ok with "no info - head down to the bottom half with the rest of the gray posts". There's no doubt in my mind they would still get good candidates. Definitely not something that should be made official without more input from other HN users: it switches the interaction from normal/passive to more hostile/active.

      Aha! (http://www.aha.io) | Rails / Front End / Security / UX | REMOTEAha! is looking for experienced Ruby on Rails, Javascript and front-end engineers to develop rich interactive experiences in React with a Rails backend. Aha! is the #1 tool for product managers to plan strategy and roadmaps.In additional to core engineering roles, we are also looking for a security engineer and UX designer to join our team.Aha! is profitable, you can work from anywhere in North America and we offer excellent benefits.
We use our own product to manage our work (which is especially rewarding), we deploy continuously and we are developing in Rails/CoffeeScript/React/d3. Our entire team is remote - primarily in US and Canada.http://www.aha.io | email: engineering-jobs@aha.io
                      
                  
      I previously interviewed with Aha! and was almost immediately turned away because I wasn't (and I quote!) "coding since I was 13" and because I didn't have a CS degree. I ended the interview early because he seemed to have lost interest after I told him I don't have a CS degree. Not a fan of that kind of interview.
                      
                  
      I was surprised to see your comment. I do most of the initial interviews for engineering at Aha! and it is hard for me to imagine saying something like that. We certainly donâ€™t limit our hiring people with a CS degree - and the fact that we did face to face interview with you, even though you donâ€™t have a degree, is proof of that. Generally I am looking for people who are passionate about writing software, and it helps a lot if they have been active in open source. That shows an interest and ability to collaborate with is essential in a 100% remote team.We do look for very strong computer science fundamentals when we interview. We are building software and it is much better when the energy goes into solving the domain specific aspects of the problem rather than basic data structures and algorithms. Some of the best people on our team donâ€™t have college degrees. However they are intensely curious and always trying to understand how and why things work, and how to improve them. A few years of experience with tough problem solving and a desire to seek elegant solutions can be better than four years of formal education.

Our tech stack includes NodeJS and MongoDB on the backend, Backbone on the frontend, React Native, Swift and Java for mobile, and Python 3 for machine learning.If you want to work with a highly driven, mission-oriented team that enjoys working hard, has fun together, and embraces quirkiness, contact us at talent@triggrhealth.com with a resume, why you are interested in this position, why you want to be a part of solving this problem, and a picture of your favorite dog or cat breed (bonus points if itâ€™s yours!).Sr Full Stack Engineer

      Asking candidates to:1) describe themselves in a thousand words or less2) write up a mock outage report3) pitch something new to "the team"just to submit their CV seems a little much. Pass.
                      
                  
      Counterpoint: I'm AOK with these ideas.I love take-home style interviews.  They're without exception the most informative for both the interviewee and the company: much more can be conveyed than in a hour face-to-face, and it's less stressful both to produce and to review, and just plain less painful to schedule.Doing it before the in-person stage is a little unusual (maybe after the first phonecall, to confirm it's not a waste of time for a position that's already filled, etc, would make more sense?), but I respect the idea.
                      
                  
      Thanks for your feed back. It's understandable that this might be too much for some people.To date, we've had a single person skip those questions and still submit. This person was not a qualified applicant.Based on the applications we've received this very minimal list of requirements appears to be working as desired. We're interested in employees who are going to do the best work of their careers. I'm okay with having a slightly higher bar (in terms of application effort) for that type of person.

      when I interviewed, take-home challenge took 5+ hours, 2 weeks for review, was given incorrect feedback from a different candidate, then rejected after further review without the option to correct a silly mistake I made. Wouldn't recommend applying here.
