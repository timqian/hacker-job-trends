MA. Cambridge and the greater Boston area. Full time.I work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (http://www.ll.mit.edu), a research and development center run by MIT that does work for the government. My group has about 20 people in it and does application security, reverse engineering, and other low level systems stuff. Knowledge of things like assembly, operating systems, and systems are pluses but not required. It's great if you have some experience in those things, but if you can code I want to talk to you. The pluses:* Extremely difficult and rewarding problems. In the past few weeks my work has had me hacking on a compiler, scaling up databases, reversing malware, etc. We're a really agile and tight knit group.* Awesome workplace culture. We're a 9-5 shop, you pick your laptop, and you can order any books that you need.* We reimburse tuition for classes at MIT. Last semester my office mate took operating systems with Robert Morris. We send you to conferences, including Blackhat and Defcon.* We sponsor relocation and have multiple positions we want to fill.You do need to be a US citizen and you will have to get a security clearance. I'm happy to talk to you about how the clearance process works and answer any questions you have. If you're local I'll buy you a cup of coffee while we talk it over. You really can't waste my time. The first step is to get in touch with me and I can explain to you how our hiring process works.Email: tsally@mit.edu
                      
                  
      I have a question related to MIT-LL: How particular are they about GPAs for graduate school? I'm given to understand they filter heavily on them for undergrad, but is that still the case for MS/PhD?
                      
                  
      GPAs tend me mean less in graduate school, but also tend to be very inflated. I would think you would still have issues if your GPA is in the 2.x range in graduate school.
                      
                  
      London, UK - Full Time - http://spider.ioAt spider.io, we look to catch bad people doing very bad things.We catch botnets, browser emulators, clickjackers, traffic launderers, bots that probe for weakness, bots that learn. At spider.io, we look to distinguish legitimate human website visitors from nefarious automated traffic.Itâ€™s a hard engineering problem. It would be a hard problem at toy levels of traffic. We need reverse Turing tests. We need to analyse from the application layer to below the TCP layer. We need clever stateful classifiers, that classify information based on previously received information. And if this isnâ€™t hard enough, imagine doing this across four times the number of messages each day than the number of tweets received by Twitter each day. This is where weâ€™ll be before the year is out. And for us this is just the beginning.If you're an engineer and would like to help us make this happen, check out our careers page: http://spider.io/careers/

Eurystheus ordered Hercules to kidnap the beast called Cerberus who guards the gates of hell - the brazed voiced hound of Hades and a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, who eats raw flesh, fifty headed, relentless and strong. Near the gates of Acheron, a weaponless Hercules found the beast waiting for him. He resembled a retailerâ€™s point of sale system.You are a Hercules incarnate. Your weapons will include CoffeeScript, Ruby, JVM, Mac/Win/Lin[1], iOS, Android, maybe even a little C. Help us crush the mediocre POS industry incumbents. Multiple headed beasts, they are tired, decadent organizations and veritable deserts upon which the seeds of innovation and creativity find no purchase.ShopKeep is fixing point of sale and becoming the â€œlast mileâ€� for local. A profoundly disruptive solution, we have established a beachhead in a sector in dire need of innovation. A well funded NYC based startup, we are fixing technology depressed, mind numbingly overpriced, and overly complex POS solutions and making them less expensive and highly customizable for both very large and very small customers.Help us as we take this battle to the next level.

      New York, NY (in NoHo on Broadway). Full time and internships.QLabsWe're a new type of in-house incubator: we prototype startups by building and launching an MVP every 6-8 weeks. This is like startup boot-camp. Come hack with us on amazing projects, learn everything there is to know about building and launching products and starting companies, all without the painful early-startup salary.We take an aggressive approach to learning and inspiration.  Example: six weeks ago, our team spent the day at MIT's Media Lab, where we learned about biomechatronics, fluid interfaces, and more. Even though our primary tool is Rails, half of us just learned nodejs for a two-week 'sprint project'.The lab started in February of this year, and now has five awesome developers (hailing from Columbia, Disney Imagineering, ITP, NYC Resistor, and more). We're looking to fill position #6.Show us your projects: we love to see an entrepreneurial streak and a diversity of experience.Email me at rw@rwinslow.com if this appeals to you!

      Hmm. Do you mind if I ask why you chose Winston Salem? I left there a year and change ago after waiting for my wife to finish college, and haven't looked back.
                      
                  
      Similar situation to yours. One of our wives is finishing a residency program in Winston Salem. Where are you located now? I am actually moving out there in a few weeks to join the company.

      I'm in Denver right now, and it would take an enormous catastrophe for me to move back to NC.I have no Twitter account, but my e-mail is in my profile if you'd like to get in touch and discuss things further.

      SF Bay Area.  Full Time.  Founding Team.  www.cinecandy.comI am the founder of Cinecandy, the world's first Movie Studio As A Service (MSAAS, for cute).  I've spent the past year solo and I am looking for a programmer and a designer.Think of what moviemaking is: a writer, a director, some actors, a post production crew, and ultimately distribution. If you think which parts of moviemaking have been disrupted by technology, really only distribution has. The creation of movies, however, has not!My vision is to completely automate the moviemaking process, from scripting, to directing, acting, post-production, and distribution.  And Cinecandy will make it so easy that anyone can do it, and do it with their friends.The first step in achieving that vision is a tool that will let people easily create group videos with their friends for special occasions.  The example I like to use is the video shown at a wedding by the Best Man while he gives a speech - lots of well-wishing from friends and family in the video.Because this initial set of users will show their videos in public, they are willing to pay for an automatically produced video.  More if it's professionally edited.I sold my last startup (www.gamemaki.com) and had a major flop with an app earlier this year:allthingsd.com/20110425/meet-remember-it-an-iphone-app-born-of-a-hangover/But I ship product and this one has me pretty stoked.  More about me in my HN profile.  Do reach out - I love talking about my baby!

      NYC H1BThe most dangerous labor of all was the twelfth and final mission.  Eurystheus ordered Hercules to kidnap the beast called Cerberus who guards the gates of hell - the brazed voiced hound of Hades and a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, who eats raw flesh, fifty headed, relentless and strong.  Near the gates of Acheron, a weaponless Hercules found the beast waiting for him.  He resembled a retailerâ€™s point of sale system.You are a Hercules incarnate.  Your weapons will include CoffeeScript, Ruby, JVM, Mac/Win/Lin[1], iOS, Android, maybe even a little C.  Help us crush the mediocre POS industry incumbents. Multiple headed beasts, they are tired, decadent organizations and veritable deserts upon which the seeds of innovation and creativity find no purchase.ShopKeep is fixing point of sale and becoming the â€œlast mileâ€� for local.  A profoundly disruptive solution, we have established a beachhead in a sector in dire need of innovation.  A well funded NYC based startup, we are fixing technology depressed, mind numbingly overpriced, and overly complex POS solutions and making them less expensive and highly customizable for both very large and very small customers.Help us as we take this battle to the next level.  You will lead the development of our products.  Your releases will immediately be running[2] in thousands of actual brick-and-mortar stores.  Like this one http://bit.ly/tEn61i.

      I had an interview with these guys a couple of weeks ago for the front end web dev position.The interview had been scheduled for a week at that point. After arriving, the person I was supposed to be interviewing with comes out late and tells me they already filled the position a week prior and didn't bother to tell me.Turns out they're still hiring for that position? Lying to prospective employees isn't nice.
                      
                  
      Just as a response to Ave's comment above,I've chatted with Alex a couple times and he is a good guy, so take my good data point with the bad.
                      
                  
      Just because you've "chatted" with someone doesn't mean that you know him in any professional capacity, let alone his company. Good people can work at bad companies and follow their rules.Calling someone in for an interview, then filling it and not telling that person is a douche move.

We're a bit different than your average startup. We're a small team that loves what we do. We only hire others who love what they do, too.Even though we're very profitable, we don't hire just for the sake of it; we hire the best people, then trust them: it's the thinking behind our no-limit vacation policy and company credit card for everyone.We love building things and we focus on being productive, not the amount of time you spend in the office. We hate meetings, so we only have one per week.We put a lot of effort into making Weebly a fun place to work for people who like getting things done.Our millions of users love us (check out our blog comments). We have a net promoter score over 80% (higher than Apple's).Running 2% of all of the websites on the Internet presents some very interesting technical challenges. Making a complex task super simple and intuitive is also an ongoing challenge.

Fully buzzword-compliant: distributed, fault-tolerant and cloud-ready; more importantly a great engineering project to do the first real redesign of the database since the mainframe.

Our first product focuses on restaurants and has been featured in the App Store since our launch 8 weeks ago.Behind the scenes we're combining collaborative filtering and other forms of machine learning with traditional information retrieval to predict what users will like, explain our prediction to users, and rank what they will want to do in the moment.Doing all this requires well architected, scalable systems for pushing lots of data and answering queries with minimal latency.I know this is only the broadest possible overview and I'd be happy to talk if you'd like to learn more.

      San Francisco, CA (Mission) - awe.sm
http://totally.awe.sm/jobsWe're hiring front-end and back-end engineers, plus an SRE (think: ops guy who gets to write production code) and a designer.Right now, we help companies track and analyze the way their content spreads over social media, and how that converts into pageviews and dollar sales. Our next phase -- the stuff the new hires will be working on -- is to move beyond merely reporting what's happening into making sense of it, and making actionable predictions based on it. That means event detection and machine learning on big, messy, real-world data sets.Because this is all new dev, we are language and technology agnostic. If you think you can solve these problems, we'll let you pick the best tools for the job. We're looking for curiosity, enthusiasm, and a track record -- you know, "smart and gets things done" :-)

      San Francisco, Lead Python DeveloperAt Tribal Crossing we work on creating games with deep story lines and engaging characters, something missing from most Facebook games today.  Tribal Crossing is looking for a strong software engineer to lead the future development of our backend game engine, refine our custom system for expressing game logic and flow, and develop new games from the planning stage to post-launch.What we're NOT:* We're NOT working in a sweatshop making clones of Zynga games* We're NOT making reskins of Evony, Kingdoms of Camelot, Atlantis, etc* We're NOT letting metrics rule our lives (Star Wars wasn't created through metrics)What we ARE:* We ARE making games that are focused on delivering amazing story lines* We ARE creating characters that players will care about* We ARE building tools that will allow allow content creators to do 1 and 2Why You Should Apply:* TECHNOLOGY: We embrace cutting edge technology if it saves us time in the long run. Ask us about how we wrote our own DSL that in turn generates code for serializing game data and defining API routes. Or perhaps watch our webinar with Membase about how we are able to support millions of users with NO sysadmin and a tiny team. Bigger doesn't always mean better, if you know how to use the right tools.* INNOVATION: We have built a wide range of tools and processes that greatly reduce both low level work and endless cross-functional meetings.

Candidates should not be scared of big O notation and like to consider space and time characteristics of their data structures and algorithms. Candidates will work with Unix, Git, Ruby, Css, Javascript, Chef, Goliath, EventMachine, MySQL, NoSQL, and lots of Cucumber and RSpec. They know HTTP. Candidates care about building simple, intuitive, user experiences. They know REST is more than clean URLs. They want to design small, isolated, highly available, fault tolerant, scalable services. We like our candidates to be curious. Candidates should like to get their hands dirty. They are fanatical about quality. They are fanatical about performance.
