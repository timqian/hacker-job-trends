      This is a good idea.I took time off when my son was born, working part time so my wife could go back to work part time too.Itâ€™s a very isolating experience. Iâ€™d also point out it can be doubly so for men doing it as if you go to a â€œparents groupâ€� all the mothers look at you as though you should be working.So thereâ€™s another market for you.
                      
                  
      I agree with this. In time for when my son was born, I changed jobs to be fully remote, to avoid my partner feeling isolate as well as to be able to spend time with my son and help raise him more than just financially, but as you say, the "parents groups" are almost entirely mums & children, and the one or two that I've been to, I feel completely out of place.
                      
                  
      Yes - my husband took shared parental leave to look after our son whilst I trained as a web developer so I'm very conscious of this as well. We're increasingly seeing traffic on the site from dads and the functionality we're building will help them equally too.
                      
                  
      As others have said, it's a great idea. My wife and I don't work from home, but it would be great to have a one-stop-shop to find out about classes/programs. Good luck. (And of course, I'll keep an eye out when/if you higher mid-level developers.)
                      
                  
      Great business idea.
                      
                  
      Ah thank you. :)It's been driven from personal experience and I like to think we're helping make a painful part of life less painful for everyone. Transforming a whole industry at the same time is a nice side effect!

Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why weâ€™re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteranâ€™s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.Itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      There seems to be only one available remote job, which is S&M - SUPPORT.
Is this correct? I was hoping for development remote jobs
                      
                  
      Unfortunately, we don't have too many truly remote teams. Most remote positions are in Canada/North America.

We're looking for someone with a strong sense of UX and clean web design, both on desktop and mobile, to help tell the complex story of our changing universe.

      I'd just like to encourage people to apply. I work with @cbanek on the LSST EPO team. Working on a large science project is amazing. Every day is interesting. There is a shared goal beyond just making money, similar to a startup with traction. The environment is pseudo-academic, which combines the best of academia and working for a national lab. The portal already has some design work done but is generally greenfield for technology choices. And last but not least Tucson is great and quite affordable.
                      
                  
      I got my start in computers working with DECam on the Dark Energy Survey. It was one of the best experiences of my life and very fulfilling. I suggest anyone who is interested in space and science to look at this closely.
                      
                  
      This sounds like a cool job. Your second link is broken though FYI!
                      
                  
      Thank you so much!  Link should be fixed.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the link fix.It looks like this is a very (almost completely) front-end heavy position. Any plans/needs for backend development?
                      
                  
      We are going to be doing some backend development!  We are building out a public data center to back the portal, and to power interactive python notebooks for education and citizen science.  We're not currently hiring for that position, but when we are, we will be sure to post it here on HN.In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me on email (cbanek@lsst.org)!
                      
                  
      So cool! If only there were a position for VFX or graphics! Sounds like an amazing opportunity for a web developer.
                      
                  
      So cool! Wish remote option was available. :-)

We're looking for senior level software engineers with experience building JavaScript apps.Elastic is the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats, and we're always interested in talking to engineers with a track record of doing great work throughout their careers.* Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary* Stock options* Paid bonding leave for parents with newborns* At least 4 weeks paid time off, 1 week of volunteer time, paid holidays, etc.* An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life* Employees with a wide variety of interests and backgrounds* Your age is only a number. It doesn't matter if you're just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.* Distributed-first company with employees in over 35 countries, spread across 18 time zones, and speaking over 30 languages! Some even fly south for the winter :)We also have dozens of other positions available across the entire company https://www.elastic.co/about/careers
                      
                  
      Elastic's reviews on Glassdoor are stellar: https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Elastic-Reviews-E751551.ht.... I work with the parent on Kibana and the reviews don't even tell the full story of how nice it is to work here.
                      
                  
      Looks like the work is good.But not sure of their hiring process.I always get the same canned response.Is it that some bots do it or recruiters.Their job description includes that we don't care about titles etc,but not sure if they are really following that.
                      
                  
      How do folks working in different time zone work in general ? Is the firm open to folks in orthogonal timezone?
                      
                  
      Kibana team members are in time zones around the world (and sometimes inconsistently since some team members travel and work simultaneously). Most of our communication is asynchronous through GitHub, email, and Slack. When we need to have synchronous conversation we set up video calls, sometimes ad hoc and sometimes scheduled. We try to be mindful of each otherâ€™s personal lives and preferred working style and generally things just work out.
                      
                  
      how much experience are you looking for ideally. Your company page says you're looking for backend engineers and I am really interested in working with distributed systems. The catch is that I am inexperienced and a new graduate
                      
                  
      Any C++ related positions?
                      
                  
      We don't do much with C++, unfortunately.  The closest thing to this would probably be golang on the Beats team.
                      
                  
      Possibly, though it's hard to say without seeing the details of your experience. There are multiple java engineering positions open as well, though.
                      
                  
      Kibana's an open source project, so if you're looking to volunteer, you can contribute directly to it without having to jump through hoops, do interviews, etc.  We follow the same process that our open source contributors do, so read through the contributing guide, take a look at the issues, and dive in!

      SAML, of course!
                      
                  
      Cabana Blockchain | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | $80k - $140k (USD/BTC)Cabana Blockchain is developing blockchain-enabled IoT devices for your smart home. Our devices will improve your life while communicating and transacting over a private blockchain. We're a privately-owned stealth startup company operating out of San Francisco, CA.We're looking to hire for the following positions:Hardware - Electrical Engineer (ONSITE)Hardware - Firmware Engineer (ONSITE, REMOTE)Hardware - Mechanical Engineer (ONSITE)Software - Backend Developer (ONSITE, REMOTE)Software - Frontend Developer (ONSITE, REMOTE)Please visit https://cabanablockchain.com/careers for details.
                      
                  
      Just a curiosity do you plan to use IOTA since it's designed specially for that use case (IoT).
                      
                  
      The current plan is to use a private blockchain. It won't use a token that's publicly tradable, like IOTA. If this doesn't work out, then perhaps we will look into something like this.
                      
                  
      Interesting, it would remove a lot of cost to use a public token and since IOTA will always have 0$ transaction fee it's perfect for companies. In any case if you hire interns let me know also (you can check my github profile, same name) ;)
                      
                  
      Unfortunately, we aren't hiring interns at this time (paid or not). If this changes in the future, we will reach out! Thanks.

      Your linked-to job ad mentions "very competitive compensation".  Can you quantify that in some way?I'm asking because I wouldn't think $1M goes very far in a labor market such as Cambridge.
                      
                  
      By "very competitive" we mean that we will match any other offers you could get for such a position, provided that we believe that you are an ideal fit (I haven't seen a range on HN today that we cannot match). The base salary will depend on the person (skills and experience) and the place of residence.
                      
                  
      Is minimal experience with distributed platforms (S3, etc.) a deal-breaker?
                      
                  
      Not necessarily, if you don't want to take the time to submit a full CV, feel free to send us a message outlining your background / experience / interests.The company is HQ'd in Cambridge, but (all) the rest of the team is remote.

Our view is that public data reflects more of our everyday lives than most of us realize. Itâ€™s everywhere, from a plane taking off from an airport to a barrel of crude oil flowing through a pipeline to a new drug being approved. These things exist in specific and separate public datasets, but together, they can provide a vast and powerful view of whatâ€™s happening in the world.https://www.enigma.com/

curiosity and the power of discovery.

Its award-winning service eliminates the time and expense of maintaining an in-house testing infrastructure, freeing development teams of any size to innovate and release better software, faster.We are currently looking for:Java Software Engineer (m/f) http://grnh.se/4je3rh1Senior Datacenter Engineer http://grnh.se/pw1q6v1Software Engineer (Cloud Infrastructure) http://grnh.se/ake0iq1Software Engineer (Virtual Desktop Cloud) http://grnh.se/1xk24i1Software Engineer (Web Developer) http://grnh.se/x6v4ye1Software Engineer- Web Frontend (m/f) http://grnh.se/euoswc1If youâ€™re interested in joining Sauce Labs and would like to learn more, please visit: https://saucelabs.com/careers
                      
                  
      What does the (m/f) mean?
                      
                  
      I believe that it means 'male/female', as certain countries require that job postings say which genders the job is open to.
                      
                  
      > as certain countries require that job postings say which genders the job is open toIn what countries is this a thing?
                      
                  
      That's definitely a thing in Germany. Pretty much all job posts there have that.It's there because of anti-discrimination laws. Job titles and occupations in German always have a gender associated with them (it's just the way the language is), but companies aren't allowed to discriminate. So it's shorter and easier to put (m/f) at the end rather than having to always list both gender forms of job titles every time the job title comes up.English still has some of those gender forms for older professions. For example, there's waiter/waitress so instead of always writing "waiter/waitress" they just write "waiter" and then put (m/f) at the end to indicate that they will hire either gender.
                      
                  
      Agreed, but adding that in Dutch a shift was even made to always designate with the male form, regardless of gender. So a "directrice" (Dutch, which would mean something like "directress" in English, a female director) then overnight became a "directeur" ("director"), with no sex change.Myself, I saw the familiar m/f designations here, and wondered whether that is still desirable, given the emerging use of additional designations?
                      
                  
      Ah, thanks! That helps clarify.
                      
                  
      Well that ended up being a lot more interesting that I expected it to be, TIL...
                      
                  
      It's a language thing. Many languages have genders attached to nouns, and the formulation is different for males and females. So in German, for example, a job posting might be for an Engineer (Techniker (m); Technikerin (f)), but instead of saying Techniker oder Technikerin, they will just write Techniker (m/f).Edit: Maultasch beat me to it.
                      
                  
      don't work for free ;)

      I'm pretty excited to see this get off the ground, are you planning on U.S. Market or concentrating on Asia/Australia?I'm you're fighting an uphill battle of 'just another vending machine' but IoT, app integrated, food robot! Automated Micro-Restaurant?
                      
                  
      Indeed, there's a lot of pent-up vending machine assumptions out there. To help segregate from that baggage, we made the decision to call them 'service locations' instead.The US market has many challenges, including but not limited to a famously high degree of food-related regulation and limited urban density. I think in the US we would test alternate formats such as drive-thrus, but frankly by the time we get there we'll already have made it in Asia.After China we will likely test HK, then probably wealthy, dense, nearby markets with high mobile payment penetration, familiarity with automated retail and aging populations such as Japan and Korea.

Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as â€˜adventuresâ€™. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm.

Youâ€™ll work on a customer facing React.js website as well as an Android only React Native app. You donâ€™t have to know our whole tech stack but itâ€™s important that youâ€™re willing to learn. Youâ€™ll collaborate closely with the CTO as we turn our proof of concept into an MVP ready for production. Youâ€™ll build new features, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you.We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually puts you in an unstable spot. Our projects are written in Javascript, React.js, React Native and all use ES6. For this role, Javascript skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education.

You will get to show that you know what youâ€™re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.We see coding as a way of communication, itâ€™s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English. Our intention is to enable remote working and flexible working hours as soon as we can. As this is one of our first hires, we need you full-time on-site in our offices in central Richmond upon Thames.

      Spydermix | https://www.spydermix.org/ | Engineer | Full-Time | RemoteInterested in giving a giant middle finger to repressive regimes? Do you eat DHTs, blockchains & P2P routing algorithms for lunch? Are ridiculously hard problems your idea of fun? Are you the kind of person who could figure out how to create a uni-directional off-chain micro-payment channel with multi-sig support for a verifiable market with order matching and final settlement via smart contract, without trusted parties - taking into account the impossibility of fair exchange without a trusted third party, maybe based on probabilistic payments and/or zero knowledge contingent payments? Did you smile reading that last part? Good, itâ€™s more fun when you have a sense of humor.Weâ€™re working on changing the game with the backing of the worldâ€™s largest VPN service. An unstoppable multi-protocol decentralized onion routing system that is going to weave privacy into the very fabric of the Internet. Like TOR, if TOR was embedded into everything, had sensible economic incentive mechanisms, and was resistant to sybil attacks.# Scale of initial deploymentServers : 100K+ 
Traffic : Exabytes 
Users : Millions# Things you probably already know in and outIP networking, onion routing, VPNs, applied cryptography & blockchains at the protocol level.# Things youâ€™ll wonder when you read the prototype Apache module for fun- Why donâ€™t most HTTP proxies support keep-alives?- Can you add a flag to the HTTP_PIPE contract to specify whether or not to use Global Session Support (GSS)?- Is there a better way to track a single session across separate processes other than keeping track of session state in shared memory?If you think youâ€™re the type of person weâ€™re looking for.
