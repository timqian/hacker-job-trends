      Thank you for being the the only listing with salary information.
                      
                  
      You're welcome. Maybe next month we'll see a salary range on all posts?
                      
                  
      Most people, including myself, won't bother applying to a position unless the salary range is posted.There's no point to doing 2, 3, or even 4 interviews for a job that potentially pays less.Employers should learn that lesson.
                      
                  
      I think there are two reasons not to post the salary range right away.1. There is always flexibility in the budget for the right people.I'm hiring engineers to my team right now and I have a clear number I got from my CEO. I am confident that budget will fit the ideal candidate that I'm trying to hire. But on the other hand, if someone more senior, or junior blows my mind, I'm willing to push for the extra numbers for the more senior, or the extra rack for the junior to get on my team.2. Salary is not everything.I do believe salary is important, but not everything. There are a good number of people who are willing to take a job with less salary if they feel they can grow there more, the culture fits them better and the potential of company is bigger there.I do understand though it is frustrating doing multiple interviews without knowing if the salary range is close to the expectations or not. If a candidate asks me on the initial phone screening about the numbers I am happy to talk about it openly.
                      
                  
      > 1. There is always flexibility in the budget for the right people.Nothing stopping you from tacking on that caveat after offering a range so people can grok you from a distance.> 2. Salary is not everything.
> I do believe salary is important, but not everything. There are a good number of people who are willing to take a job with less salary if they feel they can grow there more, the culture fits them better and the potential of company is bigger there.The only people willing to take that cut are(a) young enough not to be thinking about retirement, and(b) people naive enough to think you having a good culture lets you off the hook for being a cheapskate.Disclaimer: used to think salary wasn't everything after $x quality of living, now I'm a bit older, a bit wiser and looking at retirement. I now think I was a huge idiot in my younger years for not taking every advantage possible. - So take my views with a grain of disillusioned salt.
                      
                  
      It's also signalling. Higher salary both means the company can afford it (i.e. is stronger, healthier, a safer long term bet) and that the position is valued (as the company is willing to invest more in it).
                      
                  
      Couldn't agree with you more. Higher salaries very much represent a company's ability and desire to pay top dollar. I do caution on the long term bet. It's not as solid as may seem. I've come across many companies who throw money at the problem of not being able to attract/retain talent with market rate range salaries. Could be a number of reasons, including politics, lack of interesting projects, unsustainable culture, etc.Another major point to keep in mind is salary today vs growth in coming years. Getting a high salary today may bring with it unrealistic expectations. It may be your future bonus and raises that suffer. Your annual review will roll around and the managerial perception will be that you're already paid more than everyone on the team, so you're not getting a notable slice of the budget.My point is that things aren't always black and while, and long term may be not as advantageous as they seem. If you're looking for a career, hoping jobs every year will not help. Becomes a red flag on the resume.
                      
                  
      Really? Don't go for the maximum salary because you might be disappointed in future raises?Do you know why companies discourage job hopping and sharing your salary with coworkers (even though just mentioning a bias against sharing that information is illegal)? Because it costs them money if employees do it (i.e. it's good for employees)!Sure, throwing money at a problem isn't a way to solve it and companies that think it is are bad news, but the rest of your advise is horrible.
                      
                  
      Your points are valid and I would not disagree with anyone who is prioritizing salary over growing opportunity.But I do believe though that there are people who are in that stage of their lives where they can take the risk of joining a company where they can grow faster, have a bigger potential financial outcome for the price of taking less monthly paycheck in the short term.Personally, probably because I am younger, would take an opportunity for less $$$ where I do believe I can learn more, making me more valuable in the long run so eventually I can make more money. I think about it as an investment of my time that someone either willing to / can do, or not.I do understand that not everyone can take this risk and I think that is perfectly fine.
                      
                  
      > making me more valuable in the long run so eventually I can make more moneySorry to burst your bubble, but the "more money" from experience gained while taking a paycut will pale in comparison to "more money" from the number of years you state on your cv and dollar value of your last salary.In perhaps clearer words, taking a paycut for career growth will most likely just prohibit your potential future salaries regardless of how much technical experience you gained.This of course all changes considerably when you're talking founding/early employee where minimum wage is a real possibility..
                      
                  
      For what it's worth, even though I haven't usually posted a salary range, it's something I try to clear up in the first call. It's true it's a waste of everybody's time otherwise.We'll see if that posting the range this time will make any difference.
                      
                  
      Seems like it would be especially important for jobs where the pay is scaled for a market such as Bloomington, Indiana but remote is okay.As someone who has lived in San Diego for 14 years it is really easy to forget that lots of people can afford to live comfortably* on $60-80k when they don't live here or in the SF Bay Area, etc.(* or, for that matter, extremely well, depending upon where they do actually live).
                      
                  
      Many new job posts now including salary range. I think this is a great start.
                      
                  
      Translation. I have serious problems that need solving. You have the skills to do it. How much I value that is a TOTAL SECRET but almost certainly MUCH LESS THAN YOU DESERVE. Please beg for me to hire you now.
                      
                  
      You're correct about start ups having serious problems that need solving and a good match in a candidate having the skills to do it.The rest is far from it. The value of those skills to the start up is not a secret. Posting a range in a job listing doesn't convey to a potential candidate what his skills are valued at.How much you deserve is determined by the biggest offer you can get. Compensation packages for early stage start ups aren't "cheap" as many on this thread tend to call. If all you care about is the salary, then early stage start ups are simply not for you. This is what I was attempting to convey in my original reply. This isn't a negative thing. If you think equity is worthless (which is how these packages are supplemented for the salary), then instead of getting offended that a start up is trying to rip you off, enjoy working at a bigger company that has the deep pockets for the salary you believe you deserve.An early stage start up has a very limited amount of funds and time to develop their idea into its next stage. For each idea, there is a very unique  combination of time, money, and resources. Paying the salaries benchmarked by companies that have billions at their disposal, will make a start up burn through their small amount of money, without ever having enough resources, in much less time than needed.Reading about companies like Uber, Dropbox, Pinterest, and other big names get fortune-level valuations leads to misconceptions that these companies are still start ups and other start ups have the same capital.Early stage start ups are companies you most likely haven't heard of yet. If you listen to a podcast course from Stanford by Sam Altman, you'll learn that it takes many years to build up a start up.All this leads me back to my original statement: if you're looking for top-level salaries, don't care about equity, and think that believing in the product/vision is a joke, you shouldn't be looking at job postings on Hacker News.
                      
                  
      Ya'll complain about how hard it is to hire and at the same time brag about how it's about the experience, baby, forget the salary!You're basically self-selecting for financially stable people with no dependents which... yeah, that's what the startup world looks like, with its attendant diversity baggage.
                      
                  
      >99% of candidates don't even get into the salary discussion phase.So these are all people who have agreed to undertake your presumably time-consuming interview process without even a hint about financial compensation at the end of the tunnel?If so, it seems extremely likely that you are pre-screening out a huge pool of the most talented and intelligent developers. It takes a special kind of brainwashing to agree to jump through those kinds of hoops for a prize that is kept secret until the end of the process.
                      
                  
      It's far from a secret. Lack of discussions means the compensation package isn't negotiated first.
                      
                  
      Eh, the experience with interviewing can also pay dividends...
                      
                  
      to be blunt as well , I am pretty sure that you primarily want my skills to help you solve your problem , being excited and not capable will not get you far which you can see from 99% of poorly executed startups
go cheap will not get you far and from history we know how drinking kool aid ends up
                      
                  
      I completely agree that being excited and not capable will not get the engineer and the company far. Yet being capable and only interested in the paycheck will not make an engineer understand the customer and what the problem being solved is.In a start up with a team of 10 or less (including all roles), it's critical everyone is excited about what the start up is doing.Actually if you look at the history of success stories, the core team was always filled with those who believed the vision. Start ups that have failed, most likely did not fail due to the team having too much passion for their product.
                      
                  
      Why do you assume that if I care about the money, I only care about the money. You are making money from this business, so I expect you to pay me for my contribution what I think I am worth.This attitude that startups are doing engineers a favor by hiring them is hurting the startups themselves.
                      
                  
      there are couple misconceptions here99% of startups don't solve hard problems (it seem hard to them because they are inexperienced and excited but in all reality not so challenging ) , that doesn't mean they don't have good business idea but technical aspect is mostly easy , challenges usually come with scale which happens laterfinancial upside for 0.2% equity end 100Mil exit is --> 200000 at best and that is not much so where is that upside for somebody taking 80K instead 140k over 4 years ? Not to mention that probability of that happening is low to start within small startup it would be essential to have extremely qualified people , excitement should be secondaryI do what I do because I love it but that doesn't mean I have to do that for free or cheap so correlation between asking for fair price and not being excited (passionate) about what you do is mostly not thereI worked in couple of startups (last one had exit 500Mil) but I was paid market rate and that is mostly a reason why they succeeded (got high quality people knowing exactly what they are doing)
                      
                  
      shortly after A financing , existed 2 years , and 3 years after was exit , I don't know what were salaries before , but it was < 30 people when I joinedanyhow it is just a datapoint and most likely outlier

      Javascript Developer | UtilityAPI.com | Oakland, CA | daniel@utilityapi.com | Solar job==Description==We are a white-label SaaS that is used by solar and energy efficiency companies to collect their customer's utility bill and usage data automatically. You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect utility data from utilities. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. Also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. You will be working in our office at the SfunCube in downtown Oakland. Our current codebase is well organized, documented, and tested.==Experience Required==No years of experience, education, or certification requirements, but you do need to be able to convince me that you know and have experience with:* Javascript (not JQuery, vanilla javascript)* Regular Expressions (we use them heavily)* Python (basic knowledge)* PGP (basic usage)* Other (side projects, hackathons, hobbies, stuff you do for fun)==Compensation==$100k-$120k depending on experience.==How To Apply==Email me a cover letter and a PGP-encrypted pdf resume. Please include links to your github, bitbucket, or personal side project website (for reference, mine is daylightpirates.org).==For Solar Skeptics==In the last few years, the solar industry reached "grid parity", which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That's why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn't some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).
                      
                  
      Sounds really interesting to me, but for Oakland. Big solar fan here. Could you share links to up to date info about solar growth, which companies are big in the space, etc?
                      
                  
      Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems as though you're asking candidates to send you a PGP encrypted resume without posting the location of your public key.
                      
                  
      You can do a search on public PGP key servers such as the MIT key server. His email shows this result:https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=daniel%40utilityapi.co...PGP key here: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xE7F6FAD172EFE...
                      
                  
      Bingo, you passed the first test. This job entails a lot of figuring out what and how to find the things you need to solve a problem. The lack of a public key in the job posting is intentional.
                      
                  
      He did not seem to ask for the encrypted message to be sent to a specific key, challenge him?Someone send an encrypted message with some hint about the priv key and see if they are interested/good enough to decrypt your resume

      Glowforge - Seattle, WA - Full-timeWe're looking for (more) full-stack software engineers, back-end engineers, and front-end engineers.  We could also use an amazing visual design and a mechanical engineer who has injection molding experience.We're well-funded and founded by three technical founders (one YC alumnus) with 7-9-figure exits. We're building an insanely challenging hardware+software product straight from the pages of science-fiction that's aimed at makers and creatives. It's early-- our product team is just 5 folks, but we're growing.You can read our "coming out" article in the New York Times here:

      That "nice to have" list in the software-dev position seems a little over-broad. "Genius with back-end server technologies" plus "familiar with hardware, like drivers" plus 
"some graphics experience" plus "Javascript, CSS, and HTML"...It's hard to tell if it's a "whatever you have we can use" situation versus a "we want an ubermensch"-one.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the feedback!  Yeah, truth be told, there are a ridiculous number of skills/experiences that aren't required but would be really awesome.  We erred on the side of having relatively few "requirements" and all of the nice-to-haves we could think of for what we're building.  You could have any combination of those (or none) and still potentially be someone we'd love to hear from!
                      
                  
      We're a stealth start-up in the cloud/systems market (our target customer is us: engineers). Founded by previously successful YC portfolio alumni with great connections in the industry and the investing community.We're in pre-seed stage talking to engineers who're interested in joining very early on with significant equity upside (but we offer a salary as well).This time we want to build something big. We will be flattered if you'd consider to sit down with us, discuss the vision and possibly pick holes in it and help us fix them.Backend Tech:  - Golang and C
  - Efficient memory management and data processing.
  - Knowledge of Linux systems programming is a huge plus.
  
Frontend:  - Looking for an opinionated front-end UI/UX expert.
  - Teach us how it's done. We're backend people, we need help.

      San Francisco | VISA | REMOTEI'd like to put in a word for the Career Agency team at http://OfferLetter.io - we are building the first true talent agency for tech. We align incentives with individual engineers (and do not take money from companies), help them improve their messaging and polish, intro them directly to CTOs and VPs to help cut past recruiting bullshit, and provide negotiation advice.We want everyone to find "the team", not "a team".I'm an ex-Twitter (Growth) / ex-Amazon (Identity) engineer, and am building what I would have wanted at every step of my career.One of our client profiles [#35 employee at Twitter] is up here, for the curious:
http://offerletter.io/blog/201502-Fifteen-years-of-durabilit...[0] See http://OfferLetter.io for more information[1] We are neither recruiting agency (since we do not take money from companies) nor job board, and as such are compliant with the terms of the post[2] We are located in San Francisco, but have worked with people in Seattle, New York, and Austria, and regularly help folks on visas.
                      
                  
      Are you guys actually hiring? I don't see any jobs listed in this post or on your site.

      Clara Labs (https://claralabs.com/, YC S14) - San Francisco, Engineering, Full-TimeClara is building the simplest possible interface to getting work done.Every person on our team is involved in the thinking that creates their work - full stack in the broadest sense of the term. This means identifying, owning, and driving projects to completion.We believe shipping early and frequently builds better products. An extreme example: we scheduled thousands of meetings entirely manually for our first Clara customers before building any software at all.Accepting human dependency is the fastest way to building useful machine intelligence. The failure of intelligence products to date has fundamentally been a failure to build trust.  It is the consequence of unreliability and lack of focus (think: Siri). Conversely, Clara has delivered a highly reliable, focused, and useful natural language interface from day one.Weâ€™re looking for frontend, backend, and machine learning engineers to join our early team.

      SUSE is hiring for 68 different positions. 36 in Engineering.

You can see where we lead here: https://www.suse.com/promo/suse-leadership.htmlWhat do we offer:- Direct contact with representatives of free/open source software projects worldwide.- Regular hackathons (Hack Weeks) and workshops on the 
company, department, and team levels.- Five weeks vacation. (Â¹)- Contributions to pension insurance or capital life insurance. (Â¹)- Other common employee benefits (food coupons, health care, sports and cultural activities). (Â¹)- Free beverages.

https://attachmatehr.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseac...Â¹ Reference for the example benefits is the office in Germany. They may vary across hiring locations.Â² Please note that not all positions are available for remote workers and still relocation may be preferred.
                      
                  
      As luck would have it, I'm living in Nuremberg and would love to work at SUSE. However, I didn't get any feedback at all of my applications. Any hints on what I could do to improve my chances?
                      
                  
      You should get some feedback. Can you tell me for which positions you applied? I will make sure that it gets fixed for the future (dmacvicar at suse dot com).Speaking only for the positions my team/department: Our positions include a small challenge. You need to add a small feature or improvement via a Pull Request on Github to some code and ping pong with your future team members.The goal not only to see technical skills but also how do you work together with the current team members, how do you handle critics in your code, how do you structure your changes, etc.The challenge is not difficult, but we value the time and courage of the people who took part in it. My team tends to focus its energy in those.If the job description gives you a chance to highlight yourself from the rest, take it!.
                      
                  
      Thanks for getting back to me. I've currently applied only for the OpenSUSE developer/packager position, but I'm curious about several other positions.A general question I have is if it's a problem that I wrote my application in German. Afaik the HR team is located in Nuremberg, but I'm really not sure if English or German is expected. Personally, it's easier for me to write a formal application in German, because it's my native language.I'll take a look at the challenges as well. The benefit is, that many of them include technologies I'm not yet familiar with, so I can at least learn something new from it.
                      
                  
      There are no strict rules about an application...Giving that you want to highlight yourself for an international company doing Open Source, just follow common sense and use English, write a good cover letter, link your Github projects/repos and contributions, and avoid a .doc file :-)

      Udacity (http://udacity.com/jobs) - Mountain View, CA
Openings: Full-Stack Engineer, Backend Engineer, Front-End Engineer, Lead Designer, Product DesignerI recently saw an interactive map of the US[1]. Each state had its most common profession listed over the period of 1978-2014. For 2014, you'll see that truck driving is by far and away and the most common profession. No real surprise there. However, if you look closely, you'll see that in Utah, Virginia, Washington and Colorado that software developer has become that states most common profession. How amazing! I am convinced that within the next 2-8 years, we'll start to see a gargantuan shift where tech skills are in such demand (even more so than now) that Software Developers become the most commonplace profession across the US and world. Udacity will be powering the education behind all of that.If you're world-class in what you do, please get in touch at oliver@udacity.com.1. http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-...
                      
                  
      Keybase is! - https://keybase.io - we're a very small team, currently just 5.Location: NY, SF, or CHI -- preferably you would join us at one of these places. While remote is possible, we like people to be in pairs or more, whenever possible. It's more fun, anyway.We love these people:1. Go developers; crypto experience a big plus2. Those with platform-specific GUI experience: we're currently working on an OSX app and will be expanding to Windows, iOS, and Android soon.3. Very product-oriented engineers. This is the kind of person who'd enjoy wireframing or planning smart notifications just as much as doing either front or back end development (probably not both). Since we're pretty small, this person would do a mix of things: user interface design (very usable, but to be polished by others), actual programming, making sure everything about the site is smooth to use.  I know in a lot of companies this is often a graphic designer or dedicated interface person, but from what I learned at our last project (OkCupid), I think product-sensitive developers can be the best at it.We have yet to take any formal funding.If you're interested: chris@keybase.io

We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.The company just a year old, so early enough for non-trivial equity.

Weâ€™re a small team, growing fast, and already taking a big bite out of Craigslistâ€™s juicy NYC revenues, but weâ€™ve set our sights on much bigger goals.Our team is optimized for developer impact and freedom.* A TRULY REMOTE job. Weâ€™ve taken Jason Friedâ€™s TED talk [1] to heart and built an entirely distributed team, including even our CEO. This isnâ€™t a remote bait-and-switch job, we have no physical office for employees to report to.* Flexible work schedules. Work the times that work best for you. Our team cares about what gets done, not about how many hours you stare at your screen.* No wire frames, pixel perfect designs, or 35 page specs handed down from out of touch product managers. We trust our engineers to help define business needs and shape them.* Engineers get to take an idea from conception all to way to production, coupled with a team support system to get feedback and iterate until youâ€™ve built a something weâ€™re all proud of.* Friendly, funny, energetic co-workers.* Our company is profitable and growing.We want team members we can trust, who not only care deeply about well written and tested code, but our business as well. Be ready to learn, grow, and help the team do great things together.Send us an email, weâ€™d love to hear from you: jobs@nakedapartments.com* http://www.nakedapartments.com* http://www.nakedapartments.com/about/jobs[1] http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen...
                      
                  
      Quick question -Does remote stand for anywhere in the world or anywhere in the country where company is located?
                      
                  
      Mostly the case, but remember that you might end up working during odd hours. I live in Europe and remote for a US company. I pretty much get up/work/eat/sleep PST time.
                      
                  
      The way I see it REMOTE often stands with "compatible timezone remote".I wish there was something like "INTERNATIONAL REMOTE" which would allow us people in totally different timezones understand if the company is globally distributed/remote or not, because you might have issues if their working style is not compatible.
                      
                  
      Remote should mean anywhere in the world but expect that some companies will prefer people who can visit a local or head office regularly, or people who work in a similar timezone or country to make things easier to coordinate.

      HubSpot - Cambridge/Boston, MAhttp://hubs.ly/y0zbwS0HubSpot is a great place to work with a great culture of getting things done and delighting our customers.  HubSpot loves investing in Engineering as a way to build a world-class product.On the front-end, we use technologies like CoffeeScript and React to create a wonderful experience for our users interacting with the system.On the back-end, we use technologies like HBase, Kafka, MySQL, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, and Dropwizard.  If you haven't looked at Dropwizard, it's actually a really nice way to develop web services in Java: you can annotate paths like you would do in Python and Flask and just return a Java object that will be serialised into JSON for you by Jackson.Engineering is organised into small teams (usually around 3 people) where you can have a big impact on the product.  We deploy hundreds of times per day and use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, and an internally developed open-source system built on top of Mesos called Singularity to deploy app instance containers.  Your changes won't be languishing in git waiting for a major release.  Because deploys are so painless, we're able to deploy small changes.If Google's catch-phrase is "Don't be evil" ours is "use good judgement".  Check out our Culture Code for more information: http://www.culturecode.com.  Also take a look at our 2014 Year in Review if you're interested: http://hubs.ly/y0zbyd0.Work schedules are flexible, though most engineers get in around 10am.

That's the best thing about HubSpot: the people are great people that you can rely on, learn from, and have a great time getting things done with.

Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. Weâ€™re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that weâ€™re using: Dropwizard, Swagger, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. Weâ€™re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder). In addition weâ€™re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.---Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local. We offer an integrated social, web, and email marketing solution designed to help merchants get more customers and keep them coming back by spreading word of mouth, extending their customer service, managing their online reputation, and leveraging the Main Street Hubâ€™s merchant network.

We help growing startups hire amazing people across all verticals at a fraction of the cost of traditional recruiting firms. We started underdog.io because we experienced the pain of hiring first-hand, having worked at top startups in NYC.We're currently live in NYC, but we've had serious requests to open in 10 other cities. While the plan is to scale the recruiting piece quickly, the bigger vision is not as focused on recruiting. We're moving towards building a defensible network between companies while building candidate-facing tools.In the interest of full transparency, it's a big job with lots of positives and negatives.The Good:â€¢ Traction (https://medium.com/@joshuagoldstein/our-first-four-months-bu...) after a few months.â€¢ Proven business model - we're making significant money every month. In fact, we're making enough to pay market rate, and we haven't raised money yet.â€¢ Full technical autonomy. We've built our internal CMS and tools with Python/Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, S3, etc. but you're in charge of choosing the technologies going forward.â€¢ Work out of Founder Collective's (a well-known VC) space in SoHo.The Bad:â€¢ Less structure and certainty than a funded startup.â€¢ Only full-time developer until we build an engineering team.Email chris@underdog.io to apply.Sorry, we can't sponsor visa candidates.Keywords: New York, NYC, Developer, Dev, Python, Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, S3, https://www.underdog.io/

      Some more information, since I ran out of space:About Scry Analytics:Scry Analytics (www.scryanalytics.com) provides Big Data Science solutions to do predictive and prescriptive analytics (i.e., to "forecast the future") and our aim is to:    * Codify work-flows in the services industries so that they are well-defined & repeatable.
    
    * Collate and harmonize client's data that is required for such work-flow systems.
    
    * Provide Scry Analytics' proprietary data that improves the key performance indicators and the characteristics of such work-flow systems.
    
    * Use our proprietary Big Data Science platform as well as deep Computer Science & Math algorithms to build decision support systems that improve the metrics related to these work-flows.

Although Scry Analytics provides analytics and Big Data Science services, our aim is to minimize these services by providing automation and software solutions (where we can). We are currently solving problems in the following domains:    * Retail
    
    * Banking and Insurance
    
    * Inventory & Transportation of After Market Parts; Maintenance
    
    * Utilities and Telecom
    
    * Health care

Since most techniques that Scry Analytics is using are taken from cutting-edge research, the kind of solutions that Scry Analytics is building are unlikely to be built by companies that provide data analysts in a staff augmentation mode or those that provide IT professionals. So, we are looking for Bachelors, Masters, and PhDs in computer science, data analytics or math that have a "research" or "advanced development" bent.ï»¿

      Software Engineers - Cardiff, South Wales, UK - Sorenson MediaWe're looking to hire multiple Software Engineers for roles which will be mostly writing Javascript, both server side and client side. You do not need any Javascript experience to apply (we've hired many people without it) we find it easier to teach good engineers Javascript then to teach Javascript developers good software engineering skills.We're hiring developers for 2 products, Spark Enlight: http://www.sorensonmedia.com/spark/enlight/ and Spark Enhance: http://www.sorensonmedia.com/spark/enhance/We work in an Agile environment with daily Scrums, Retrospectives and 2 week sprints (though some teams have been experimenting with Kanban) and a real focus on the Engineering department owning the Engineering processes which means you get to spend your time writing code and have the autonomy to try changes to the processes and see if they work.We're looking for multiple engineers with a range of experience levels (from recent grads to Senior Developers) so I can't specify specific salaries but I think they tend to be higher than most other Cardiff companies.If any of this sounds interesting then feel free to contact me at mgrover@sorensonmedia.com with any questions, CVs, github profiles etc.Thanks - Matt

      Connexity - Camarillo, CA (Los Angeles area)We're seeking a Rails developer with a keen interest in both technical challenges and business opportunity.  We work at a scale where seemingly "small" improvements can have a big impact.We do online display advertising, and run 50 to 100 million impressions each day.  Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day.As you might have guessed, we're not serving that volume through Rails itself.  Our Rails app is used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites.This role is a great way to learn advertising tech as well as other tools.In addition to the conventional Rails work, you'd get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala.  Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C or sophisticated reporting and optimization).  Not really possible to get bored around here unless you're a boring person.Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work. Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.
