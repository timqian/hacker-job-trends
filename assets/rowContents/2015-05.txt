      "We're a dozen engineers building the foundation for Dropbox's first office outside San Francisco." - That reads like you're construction workers. (Maybe you are!)
                      
                  
      It isn't so bad! Making bucks, getting exercise, working outside...

      Silent Circle - Geneva - REMOTE the norm, INTERNs welcomeWe do end-to-end secure communications and a secure mobile platform (Blackphone).  The people who work here are highly interested in ensuring that privacy remains a possibility in the world.We need great engineers who like working on Android (both at the application and the OS layer), iOS applications, back-end infrastructure (e.g. relational and distributed DBs, messaging layers, etc.), and in C, Erlang, Python, and Lua.By working here you'll have the opportunity to work on hard problems with interesting people like PRZ.  We've grown quickly but are still a startup.  We hire great people to whom we can give autonomy to get the job done.  As our main job is protecting our customers in hostile environments, we want people who are exceptionally good and exceptionally careful.We're a distributed team, and we're perfectly happy to hire great people anywhere in the world.Experience with cryptography, protocol implementation, telephony/VoIP, etc. is definitely interesting to us but not required for all positions.  We mainly want people who are demonstrably great engineers in the UNIX mold.  F/OSS work is a great sign to us.  We are very interested in Android experience right now.Please email frank, CC myself (my username), @silentcircle.com.  If you could write a few paragraphs about yourself and what sort of work you like to do, that'd be appreciated.  Links to GitHub and LinkedIn are also good.I look forward to talking with you.(Engineers only; no recruiters please.)
                      
                  
      Incidentally I checked your hiring page a few days ago and found only non-engineering jobs listed. Will definitely send you an e-mail though.I hope you don't mind me saying, the hiring page required me to turn on cookies. For a privacy-focused company I think it would look best to not set cookies at all. (Or use cookies only for personal settings like language selection, like DuckDuckGo does.)Edit: Can't find a public key for Frank nor Travis on pgp.mit.edu, will e-mail JshWright, okay?
                      
                  
      Yeah, you can email me and it'll find its way to the right people. My work email is josh at silentcircle.To be honest, the hiring site is run and used by the business side of the house, as engineering prefers finding folks through other channels (e.g. this one...). I doubt we have any control over whether or not the site requires cookies, as it is a third party solution (other than picking a different provider, but that's well above my pay grade).

      Nava - Washington DCI'm part of a small team of expats from Silicon Valley that came out to DC last year to help fix healthcare.gov. (Mostly Stanford, Google, Y Combinator folks) We've learned a ton, and see an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people - we've started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.
In the last 6 months, we've launched 2 major projects:- App 2.0, the new insurance application for healthcare.gov. It's processing 70% of apps coming through the marketplace, and: converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, is mobile-friendly (20% of apps), sits on robust, scalable infrastructure, etc etc. It was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service) ever hosted on Amazon AWS.- Scalable Login System (SLS), the new identity management system for healthcare.gov. Sadly, the main achievement here is that the system is actually up and available, unlike its predecessor. It's now saving the taxpayer $70M in annual maintenance costs.Here's a Wired article from last summer about us: http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/We're just starting on a few major new projects that have a huge potential to improve our government. We have the technical experience to do things the right way, and the relationships and trust inside government agencies to get things done. Our momentum is strong, the problem is important, and we're looking for good people.If you're the type that would get fired up about reimagining broken government experiences and technology, please drop us a line at jobs@navahq.com, we'd love to hear from you!Specifically, weâ€™re looking for:- a product manager with a technical background- a senior devops engineer- a senior full-stack engineer
                      
                  
      Props to you and everyone else helping to rebuild our government's technology! This is a much sexier problem than it gets credit for. Let's stop complaining about politicians and roll up our sleeves to make this country more kickass. Government agencies everywhere could use some great developers.
                      
                  
      Gabe, This sounds like a really interesting and challenging project. I can't even begin to imagine some of the hurdles that you will be up against with this.We just shot you an email and hope to chat soon!Jake
                      
                  
      I just wanted to say that this sounds totally awesome, and if I didn't have criminal baggage and was willing to relocate to DC, I'd be all over this.Thanks for doing work :)

      Javascript Developer | UtilityAPI.com | Oakland, CA | daniel@utilityapi.com | Solar job==Description==We are a white-label SaaS that is used by solar and energy efficiency companies to collect their customer's utility bill and usage data automatically. You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect utility data from utilities. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. Also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. You will be working in our office at the SfunCube in downtown Oakland. Our current codebase is well organized, documented, and tested.==Experience Required==No years of experience, education, or certification requirements, but you do need to be able to convince me that you know and have experience with:* Javascript (not JQuery, vanilla javascript)* Regular Expressions (we use them heavily)* Python (basic knowledge)* PGP (basic usage)* Other (side projects, hackathons, hobbies, stuff you do for fun)==Compensation==$100k-$120k depending on experience.==How To Apply==Email me a cover letter and a PGP-encrypted pdf resume. Please include links to your github, bitbucket, or personal side project website (for reference, mine is daylightpirates.org).==For Solar Skeptics==In the last few years, the solar industry reached "grid parity", which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That's why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn't some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).

      Yes. "You will be working in our office at the SfunCube in downtown Oakland."

      IBM Watson | Pittsburgh | Front-end, back-end, QA, support, and PMIBM Watson in Pittsburgh has six open positions as of this posting. This is for full time and IBM will do visas for qualified candidates.Iâ€™m the software engineer tech lead on the Watson Explorer connectivity team and former consultant with the product's Professional Services team.http://ibm.biz/watson-pgh-jobs* Watson Technical Product Manager* Watson User Interface (UI) Junior Developer* Watson Software Engineer* Watson User Interface (UI) Developer* Watson Quality Engineer* Watson Support Explorer EngineerWeâ€™re looking for folks versed in Java, Scala, and the Ruby on Rails stack. The UI positions are heavily focused on Angular.js and Bootstrap. We're in new development mode right now, so if you like to start from nothing, you'll like what we're doing.We do things like TDD, real actual pair programmingâ€ , kanban, agile-ish planning (IBM Design Thinking, not some convoluted buzzword bullshit), automated builds, â€œuse the right tool for the job even if itâ€™s not an IBM productâ€�, and daily stand ups that, for the most part, never run past 15 minutes.We like to have fun, too, having regular board game lunches and evenings, hosting meetup events, weekly communal lunch cooked by one or more of our fantastic cooks, and managers that are incredibly full-of-clue and treat us like the adults we all are.We try to keep our interview process as bullshit-free as possible. If we think you look good on paper, weâ€™ll reach out for a phone chat and give you the details on a pretty open-ended code test, where youâ€™ll implement a simple library. If we like your solution, then weâ€™ll invite you for a live culture fit and technical interview, in-person if youâ€™re near or remote if not. This process has given us a ridiculously low turnover.â€  no, really. We shoot for 50%-75% pairing, otherwise known as â€œpair when it makes senseâ€�.

      Hereâ€™s why I responded so badly to your rejection last month:You advertise â€œlots of room for personal growth,â€� and â€œFrontend, backend, junior, senior â€“ if you have talent and passion youâ€™ll fit in.â€�Iâ€™m currently severely underemployed doing IT stuff at a small organization, and Iâ€™m trying to switch to a development role. So, I applied for your company, and got rejected because Iâ€™m doing IT stuff.That was not just a rejection. That was a condemnation. Big organizations donâ€™t want me for IT because I havenâ€™t been doing IT for big organizations. Small organizations canâ€™t afford to pay me a living wage. IT contractor organizations want me to own my own car before hiring me. By pigeonholing me in IT, you were condemning me to underemployment and poverty.I am a developer, and I want a job doing development.
                      
                  
      I understand that your job search has been frustrating, and I'm sorry you felt misled by our careers page. I'd prefer not to comment on our decision in this public forum, but feel free to reach out to me offline (you have my contact information of course) if you'd like to discuss further.
                      
                  
      Then you should change your job description so you can quit wasting everybodyâ€™s time, having to reject candidates who donâ€™t fit your mysterious criteria.Also, â€œgood fitâ€� is one of the reasons our industry is so stuck in white male hegemony. Just saying.
                      
                  
      The nature of your responses suggest you probably weren't rejected solely for your work history.
                      
                  
      I like to think that I was cordial and professional up until the rejection.After that, well, I donâ€™t have much to lose, so I might as well call out what I saw to be systematic bad behavior. It was cathartic, and I believe in the duty of individuals to identify and fix what is broken in society. Itâ€™s also why most companies reject using impersonal form letters sent from no-reply email addresses.I like to think that Steve chose based on his guess about whether I could do the job. Nothing personal. But Steve asked for passion, so he got passion. Seriously, change the job description so it more accurately describes what youâ€™re looking for.
                      
                  
      OK, I'm really reticent to respond, but I've seen a few of your posts and feel weirdly compelled to help you. I love that you have strong opinions on recruiting/hiring, you do have passion, and you're clearly a very principled guy. I have no doubt that you're probably a very nice, decent person in real life.However, you are absolutely going about job-hunting all wrong. You don't want to believe this, and I get itâ€”finding work often really sucks. But you're coming off really badly and only exacerbating the vicious cycle. You need to treat this like a programming problem: you've been trying the same code for months (years?), and it's still buggy as all hell. Instead of continuing to tinker with that code, write something else and attack the problem differently. Spamming Google is not a viable strategy. Lashing out at employers in these threads is not a viable strategy. Constantly talking about how badly you need more money (however true) is not a viable strategy.Look man, you don't know me from Adam. You have no obligation to listen to me. But I'm telling you 100% that a huge reason you're not getting offers is because of your attitude, not your aptitude. You can either read this and fume (I know I would for awhile), or read this and fume and then make a drastic change. When you wake up tomorrow, redo your resume, re-think your cover letters, rejigger your entire approach to job hunting. You may even find this attitude shift pays dividends elsewhere in your life, too.
                      
                  
      Speaking as someone who has been underemployed for years, I can safely say that this advice is a load of crap. Yes, it is true that lashing out won't improve anything (although, there is at least the small chance that someone will listen to the lashing and change a policy, small though it may be). Also, the lashing only constitutes a poor attitude if it is both lashing and also wrong. In this case it looks like correct and well-placed lashing to me. It might not be rational to do it since it won't affect change, but it's not a "bad attitude" to do it either. Trying to label it as a "bad attitude" is, I believe, an alarming form of blame-the-victim mentality.Underemployment can be an absolute career killer in technology. It can drain you of all energy to engage in personal tinkering or self-study to maintain current skills. Despite being intellectual drudgery, the work can still be emotionally and psychologically draining. It fosters burnout.I'd rather see someone on the thread take a kind and caring attitude to a colleague here who is dealing with one of the really gruesome career problems of this field. Rather than some dumb finger-wagging about "just change your attitude."The problem is so widespread & systematic, just like the open-office problem, closed/political allocation of projects problem, macho subordination/willingness to work in Agile/Scrum problem, and a host of others. It's like this because people don't lash out. No one stands up and protects their speciality ... many just embrace mediocrity and a steady pay check and figure who cares what the organization wants me to do. Then, if anyone should be so audacious and arrogant as to desire some bit of intellectual prosperity in life while still earning a living wage, they must have a bad attitude, right?Many employers, especially large bureaucratic ones, actively look to underemploy people. They foolishly model that surplus labor as a latent benefit or an extra assurance that the baseline labor required of the position will be more easily guaranteed. There is almost no effort to model surplus labor as a source of burnout and turnover. Such things are swept under the rug of "bad attitude" or "not a team player" or whatever other subversive codeword that HR-types want to put on it.Often they are willing to pay above market rates specifically to underemploy you. This is the double trap of not being able to build career-affirming skills on the job and also not being able to switch jobs without a pay cut.It seems a lot of people just don't value intellectual prosperity most of the time. It works out for employers and the worker gets what they want and everyone is happy.But if you are oriented internally, possibly at the genetic level, to be incapable of avoiding burnout and extreme, unsustainable job dissatisfaction when you are expected to be willfully underemployed, the system just can't handle you. There is no attitude adjustment that will fix it -- you could have the nicest and most polite disposition of all time, while suavely executing interviews and wooing management -- it won't matter.Your unwillingness to be satisfied with underemployment is, in and of itself, considered toxic to bureaucracy. The bureaucracy system cannot function if intellectual prosperity is something it must actually provide for workers, rather than just merely paying lip service to it.Anyway, I don't have any answers except to say that I totally understand where the lashing out is coming from. It's human. It's coming from an urge to call bullshit on underemployment and to vent frustrations about systematic mistreatment of underemployed workers. It doesn't speak to any attitude malfunction whatsoever, and labeling it as such is just one more of the many tactics that bureaucracy uses to expunge the so-called toxin. I can relate to this person. I feel compassion for them.

      Senior Software Engineer | Austin, TX | OwnLocal (YC W2010)TL;DR: Full-time, local only. Contact hack@ownlocal.com. RoR, Go, ElasticSearch but we think you can learn these things on the job if you're competent. We treat employees like humans. $90k and up depending on experience.We're a Ruby on Rails shop who has recently consolidated a bunch of backend tech into Go and ElasticSearch. We would love a few engineers who would be interested in working in all three and could lend expertise to the latter two.
We're generally interested in gathering information from print ads, so strategies around data entry applications or experience with computer vision is also really exciting for us.Our request volume has been increasing by 10s to 100s of millions each month and we've had to learn a lot of new things to keep up. It's fun and exciting times but we're shorthanded to handle the load!OwnLocal is dedicated to having a quality work environment for everyone. On our engineering team we value collaboration over competition, respect work-life balance and solve problems without blaming people. We have a "no assholes" policy. We have great health insurance. We're big enough to be stable but small enough to still be startupy. We pay market rate for Austin; the lowest salary for this position is around $90k/yr.We believe that someone who is truly a senior software engineer can come from almost any background and pick up a new set of tech in a reasonable amount of time which is why we don't list much about our tech stack in our ads.

      AmazonUI (AUI) team at Amazon - Seattle or San Francisco - Full time - On-site only - Relocation packages availableAUI is the Front-end platform being adopted on Amazon.com. We are modernizing the company's front end code base, while diving deep on latency, performance, API design, user experience, and cross browser/device compatibility. Basically, we need people who can build libraries, not just use them.Our team is incredibly customer centric. For any given situation, we have to make the right choice on behalf of the folks using our platform -- and we have to do it at scale. That may sound cliche, but within the next hour AUI will be used to generate tens of millions of page views. And that's just in the US. Worldwide, we're used on about 90% of requests across all device categories.It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of opportunity. For example, we can run experiments that change almost every page on Amazon.com. We can also impact the page load time for the entire site. Have you ever tried to figure out why your site is 6ms slower? We have.We use these tools (but don't expect you to know all of them):
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Perl, GitAnd to give you an idea of who you will be working with, the folks responsible for these articles are on our team:

      The example you provide on the page: "discover what you should name your kid if you want them to be a US senator" are you actually going to show causal estimates? Names are very endogenous. If you are looking at the likelihood of being a US senator conditioning on someones name, this is very different from the causal effect of the name.

We have a stable client base, offer retirement and health benefits, competitive salary, and a 20-hour work week. Read more about our job philosophy here: http://apsis.io/apsis/blog/2015/04/23/work-sustainably/.Questions, contact: jobs at apsis.io
                      
                  
      Huh, that sounds intriguing.What 'kind' of engineer are you looking for? Any specific platforms, languages or fields of interest? I went through the site and the portfolio consists of multiple (and very different) projects, so I'm just wondering how it works. :)
                      
                  
      We're a pretty small software consulting agency, so we're looking for engineers that are capable of learning new technologies and adopting to best-practices in those technologies.Ideally, we're looking for people that:* bring expertise in at least one framework that we're likely to use[1], and* love to start projects in a software stack that they haven't used before.[1] Rails, django, iOS, Android, Xamarin, WPF, visual design skills
                      
                  
      Makes sense.I mean, I mostly work with C# and F# on the back-end, but I created my fair share of WPF apps which I vastly prefer to web front ends. I also tinker with Scala in my free time, but I don't really know much about the JVM ecosystem.I also readily admit I know next to nothing (neither have a feeling for) the UI/UX design, which is why I usually relied on libraries like MahApps; lately I had my eye on Material Design for WPF.Considering my contract is up soon(ish), what you're offering looks tempting. :)All things considered, I still feel compelled to ask: do you have a salary range or is it discussed individually? Or both, to a degree?
                      
                  
      > All things considered, I still feel compelled to ask: do you have a salary range or is it discussed individually? Or both, to a degree?Both, to a degree. Specific salary offers are going to vary a great-deal with candidate experience. Our salary floor is $65,000 / year, and it ranges up from there. We also offer retirement and health-insurance reimbursement.As a final bonus, you get to sign our confidentiality agreement which says that you'll keep our clients' confidential information secret!
                      
                  
      Any prospective clients for more C++/native stuff? (Thus the type of an engineer).
                      
                  
      Right now we don't have any prospective clients that have projects that would call specifically for C++/native stuff. We have some clients that may have problems that need to be solved with that kind of work in the medium-term future.Ideally we're looking for engineers that have a pretty-broad skill-set, that are happy to pick up new frameworks, languages, and code-bases as necessary.
                      
                  
      Sounds too good to be true!
                      
                  
      We're hoping someday it won't; with the rapid pace of automation, we're going to need to rethink what constitutes a productive adult life. We're quickly moving past the point at which society needs a 40-hour work week, and it's time for business to recognize that fact.
                      
                  
      are you able to consider applicants from Europe?
                      
                  
      We're definitely willing to consider applicants from Europe.The only qualification I would provide is that I don't have experience hiring outside of the US. If we decide to move forward with a hire from Europe, we'll need to work closely with a lawyer to figure out how to get all of our legal-ducks in a row.

      Gradescope - https://gradescope.com
Berkeley, CA | on-site onlyLearning has been assessed in the same way for decades: instructors give out paper-based assignments, tediously grade them by hand, and return them to students. With this process, instructors gain little insight into their studentsâ€™ knowledge. Simply measuring the frequency of a specific mistake requires painstaking tallying. Answering the question â€œWhat concepts are my students struggling with?â€� is practically impossible.Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: for example, we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors get grading done in half the time.Our product has been used to grade over 3 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. Weâ€™ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time hires to join the founding team of two PhDs and professor from Berkeley CS. Over the next few months, weâ€™re looking to expand our user base tenfold, and roll out advanced features including autograding, analytics, and more. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity.Weâ€™re currently hiring for two positions:

      Thats pathetic that 3 years makes you senior wherever you're working at.  You (or your hiring manager) need to up your standards.Although "senior-ness" shouldn't really be counted in years but in skill, no industry should be calling anyone senior without at least 8-10 years exp.

      You certainly get my vote for "most interesting who's hiring of the month"!For what it's worth, I'd advise listing that you're also hiring a fairly technically minded BD person too. There are plenty of technologists on Hacker News who have reached their peak for software contributions and are looking to switch into more business minded areas. In my humble opinion, with the right mentoring, people with the technical background are better suited to learning sales and BD than MBAs are at learning to talk the technical talk.
