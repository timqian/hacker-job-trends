Render (https://render.com) | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineers | Full-time | Visa | Onsite
When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and Postgres, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for people with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.We're serving live applications in production and building out our founding engineering and design teams in SF. The company is backed by top venture funds and former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox.I'm the founder and would love to hear from you at anurag@render.com.

      It seems unusual for a nonprofit to be able to offer what appear to be market-rate salaries for technical positions.  Wonder how they do it.  Couldn't find much info on the site about where, exactly, their funding comes from.I looked at their 2016 Form 990 (most recent available on Guidestar) and it looks like vast majority of funding is from contributions and grants, and revenue exceeds expenses, so that's a good sign.
                      
                  
      Hi, I'm an engineer at Thorn. You're right, it is unusual. It's also a big part of our strategy to attract, and keep, top talent. And that goes for talent across the organization: our fundraising, our marketing, our product managers, and our engineers. We're lucky to have such an amazing team, and a fundraising strategy that attracts brilliant investors and donors alike to fund the technology that we need to move the needle on this issue.Is the US/Canada restriction on remote for financial or time zone reasons (or both?)?> You're right, it is unusual.But its also exceptionally sensible. Its one of those costs that look bad on the book at first but pay for themselves over the long haul by a considerable distance.
                      
                  
      Worth noting that Ashton Kutcher is one of Thorn's co-founders, provided some initial funding, and is likely in a great position to fund-raise for it outside (and within) the usual channels.Why USA & Canada only? You're missing on great candidates (e.g. me :P) that are only slightly to the south.TN Visa stuff is one guess? Unless your'e in Mexico then...no idea.I'm in Mexico. And yes I find that distinction weird and arbitrary. There's a lot of "Remote OK but USA and Canada only" posts in this list. I'm sure there's a very good reason that has nothing to do with discrimination butâ€¦ well, that wouldn't be surprising either.You are doing amazing work in this world. Be encouraged and keep it up!Applied! You guys are doing great work.

      METAMay I ask you to change the leading text to something more useful for remote workers?REMOTE doesn't cover but the most basic possibility and 90 matches on this page make it quite cumbersome to find what suits you.What about deprecating it and requiring posters to use instead:REMOTE_WORLD - for telecommuting from anywhere in the worldREMOTE_US - for telecommuting from anywhere in the USAREMOTE_US_TX - for telecommuting from anywhere in Texas, USAREMOTE_MINUS_6 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC-6 timezone, standard timeREMOTE_PLUS_1 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC+1 timezone, standard timeExample: In the past, I telecommuted to Boston (US-MA) from Barcelona (ES). That job would have been advertised as "REMOTE_MINUS_5, REMOTE_WORLD". In fact I worked 3pm-11pm in ES (i.e. 9am-5pm in US-MA), which was certainly unusual but quite doable nonetheless.
                      
                  
      > REMOTE doesn't cover but the most basic possibility and 90 matches on this page make it quite cumbersome to find what suits you.Agree. Personally I don't care what the format is, but the postings should communicate any country/time zone/geo restrictions. That saves everyone's times.

      is there an email i can reach out to?Ozora Research | Engineers, Linguists | Berkeley, CA | Part-Time | Onsite | EquityMy company, Ozora Research, is developing a next-generation suite of Natural Language Processing tools centered around sentence parsing. We spend our time thinking deeply about the structure of language and then building statistical models that capture the structure. The requirements are: a good background in mathematics and statistics, and a deep interest in language and linguistics. Programming skill is a huge plus, but not an absolute requirement.I believe we are poised to make a huge dent in the world of NLP and linguistics. The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank). In my research I've discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. I've spent the last couple of years validating the approach, and now that I'm confident it works, I'm looking to build up a team.I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won't appeal to everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I can also guarantee that you will get a ton of great experience that you would be tough to get at a big company. I want to especially encourage the following types of people to reach out:- Recent grads in technical fields who want to break into the software engineering industry- People who have had some success in mainstream software engineering careers, but are now bored and want to try something new- People who want are thinking about going to graduate school in CS/ML/AI/NLP and want some experience doing research in that areaI'm happy to talk more about the specifics in person.

Our customers are fine with fewer features, but are not ok with broken features.- Small, accountable and autonomous teams of amazing people, eager to learn, teach and constantly improve our way of working.- We believe that great individual contributors generate as much (or more!) value as engineering managers, and we compensate them accordingly.What you'll bring:- Exceptional technical background.- Strong sense of ownership and accountability for what you're building.  What you build today will be the foundation for dozens of other systems in the future.- Frankness on discussing technical matters. If you disagree with how things are being done, we encourage you to speak up. You can attack an idea without attacking the person behind it.- Passion for code. We love people that take pride in and love programming, especially if they've done so since a very young age.- Experience in Haskell, Scala, Functional Programming, Elixir or F# is a plusDoes Brex sound like home?
