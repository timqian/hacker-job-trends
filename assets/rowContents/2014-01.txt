      Transcriptic: Full-stack developer (emphasis on frontend)Menlo Park, CATranscriptic is "Amazon Web Services" for the life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.We're a small startup (you'd be #10), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.Recent coverage: http://theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcriptic-t...team at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/
                      
                  
      I'm probably not a good candidate for you (if for no other reason than that I'm not willing to relocate), but this sounds amazing. It's not often that I hear about a new startup and think, "That really could change the world."
                      
                  
      I am not applying for a job. I just wanted to say this is a really fascinating business model. I hope you guys do well!
                      
                  
      Excuse me, but what would you say if I sent you a fully-trained biologist who doesn't have so much coding experience, but can easily learn?
                      
                  
      Potentially, but not for this role. A startup isn't a place to learn, unfortunately; it's a place to execute on the skills you already know cold. However, do we have one opening for a PhD-level staff scientist that we could consider your friend for.
                      
                  
      Fair enough.  Unfortunately my friend is MSc-level rather than PhD-level at this time.  Speaking of PhD's, do you know what biological fields look good to do a PhD in?Thanks for the answer.

We're building real-time collaborative tools and a community hub for game developers.We'll shortly be hiring for excellent front-end, back-end or full stack developers.

We're a super small team and you will really be able to leave your mark on the project and on the games industry here. You must have shipped impressive web projects in the past and can wow me with your technical prowess.We're also a TechStars London company.Get in touch at info@playcanvas.com for more information.
                      
                  
      Software developer, Stat.io - Cambridge UK, or REMOTEWe aim to allow users to understand the socio-economics of any location, from the population of a country to the crime rate of a postcode. Organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it's businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, NGOs trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely.The two main technical challenges we face are:* Importing data from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and understanding their structure. For instance, given an Excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.* Designing a UI that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that UI fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)Our technology stack:* Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we've imported* Elasticsearch for... search* Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing)* A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js)Things we like:* Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it's better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests)* Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they're ready, and try to break work down to small pieces.* Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Rather than planning for every possibility up front, we implement something small but useful to start with, and then iterate and refactor as necessary.What we're looking for:We were founded in Cambridge last year, and we're now working towards a product covering public data for the UK.We're looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time for Â£1,000 a month + stock option plan. We're joining Microsoft Ventures in London from February 2013, so you can join us in Cambridge or London, or work remotely.If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: contact@stat.io. If you'd like to apply, please send us a CV and a paragraph describing why you're interested.You can find out more about us on our website: http://www.stat.io/

      Hi all,As you're planning your New Year's resolutions, consider: if you could work anywhere, what would you do?- Wouldn't you want to work towards really making the world a better place?- Wouldn't you want to work with a top-notch team alongside some of the brightest engineers in the industry?- Wouldn't you want to work on solving interesting problems that haven't been solved before?---At Khan Academy, I truly believe that you can find all of those things and more. We're a small, 50-person non-profit tech startup making a big difference in the world. Here's a testimonial we received just last night:December 31, 2013I have recently turned thirteen, and accompanied by your proficient and efficient teaching style, I have successfully advanced into multi-variable calculus. When I was 9 I began Calculus. However when I started these courses, I was capable of grasping these concepts in a deep level of intuition. Now I am advancing into Green's Theorem, Triple Integrals, Divergence, Curl, Gradient, and Partial Derivatives. In essence, I would just like to say thank you for providing this revolutionary interconnected education interface. Hopefully I will be taking the AP Calculus examinations soon!Thank you for everything!How cool is that? Think of how many similar students are born to learn advanced math and science but never get the chance. We're working to change this. This letter is one story; every month we hear about hundreds more lives like this that we've totally transformed.We're starting to do a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs right now. We're totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now you can build large parts of a product that's guaranteed to have millions of users. If you are (or you know) a mobile developer we can build a great team around, please reach out. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of interactive exercises. Our 100,000+ math problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.With this scale, we're able to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how Socratic-style lectures affect engagement. (We're also beginning to release anonymized data to interested researchers.)Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business â€“ though we have "celebrity" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we're a non-profit, we pay well too.---As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us and we're doing everything we can to find great mobile devs.We're hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.Please apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers directly (say you saw us on HN!), but if you have questions, feel free to ask here or to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org.Thanks for reading; have a great 2014![1]: http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...[2]: http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...[3]: http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/ (sorry about the background, but there are dinosaur pictures!)[4]: http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we...[5]: http://life.khanacademy.org/

The actually amount sent in that transaction is highlighted in red. :) About $100 USD in today's BTC/USD rates. The Total input/output is the amount sent/received by that address(1e4yhZqruTy5X7tJtPPLUcrfx9F67xyLL) since the beginning of time. That's not my address btw, that's one of BTC-e.com's internal operations addresses where I purchased and sent the BTC from. coinbase.com(without creditcard on file) will take 4 days to get BTC but I happened to have some USD in BTC-e.com that was handy for a quick BTC purchase. I don't actually hold BTC at the moment, only Litecoin. I only have coinbase.com to buy BTC, to send to BTC-e.com, to exchange for Litecoins.

      Sorry about that, can't edit my post any more.Mountain View, CA, but remote is a possibility for the right candidate.
                      
                  
      Is remote a possibility for an intern? And are internships available for high school students?
                      
                  
      We have given internships to high schoolers in the past -- spicyj here started as an intern right out of high school and now has his hands in everything we do as a full-timer.Remote internships have been done in the past too, but we strongly encourage being in Mountain View both for our sake and yours. The summers are a blast with all interns in-office together and enjoying various team activities.I suggest you apply!
                      
                  
      I find you guys requiring a transcript with the intern application distasteful tbh.

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Learn more at http://amacapital.net/careers.html, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.

      Curious why people downvoted this?
                      
                  
      I guess they're getting tired of the "leading NoSQL database" tripe.  Which, despite its being utterly devoid of meaning (if you understand anything at all about the general database landscape), 10gen just keeps repeating, and repeating, and repeating.
                      
                  
      Secret: HALF-TIME/INTERN/REMOTEHey, HN. One of you is perfect for this idea.I am a serial entrepreneur who is currently trapped in the body of a freelance contractor. I have a relatively stable 40 hour a week project, and incoming projects as well that I generally can't take due to lack of resources (time, the most precious one)So here's the idea.
You. Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.
I would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue/equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.Here is what you get.
Money
Freedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)
Real World Education
Ability to become a killer coder
and whatever else. i'm pretty flexibleLanguages?
Python/Ruby Obj-C Javascript
You name it.
If you can show competency in some language I currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.About me, your 'boss'.
Late 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the 'valley'. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.
I have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.Long story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.You'll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).We'll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.email hn0114@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.
                      
                  
      Sounds like a bad idea to negotiate equity after the project "takes off". Someone is going to be pissed off in that scenario.
                      
                  
      This. You can't wait for the risks to dissolve and then put the guy who made it happen in a severely weakened negotiation position. I mean, you can, but it's unethical.
                      
                  
      Just sent you the request. Let me know if I fit the role!
                      
                  
      Why does this sound too good to be true?

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan  (INTERN yes, REMOTE/H1B no)http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why youâ€™re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

      San Francisco, CAAcademia.edu is trying to improve the way that academic publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, discovering clean energy amongst other things.We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world." Over 6 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 600k plus join up each month.If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

      Mercaris - Chicago, IL - Rails DeveloperMercaris is a data service and trading platform for identity preserved (Organic, non-GMO) agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soybeans, etc.). We are currently raising a series A after closing a seed round and getting early traction. Things are going well and we are excited to be expanding the team! Not only are we a startup (the team went through Excelerate 2011, which is now Techstars Chicago) but we are working on a real problem that should help companies meet the rising consumer demand for healthier food options. What I love about posting this job on HN is it is a community of people who get excited about this kind of thing :)You will be our first engineering hire (outside of myself) and will contribute to the website, the data collection tool, subscription reports and our auction platform. All are currently Rails, with a live trading platform under development that is Erlang/Elixir. The front end relies on jQuery and some graphing libraries. The code is ripe for some refactoring (don't worry, it isn't awful, but we pursued a few directions that we did not end up going in). You will have a large degree of flexibility to add functionality, clean things up, upgrade libraries, etc. with the strong caveat that you must write tests to make sure that you don't break anything and that you test browser compatibility. Ideally you should have enough experience to be able to contribute immediately but not so much as to be bored. Some other potentially interesting projects that will need to be tackled include a more robust testing suite and continuous integration.I work out of a combination of 1871 and from home, so schedule will be flexible. I like to provide a fair degree of autonomy, but that only works with a large degree of communication. We use Asana to track tasks and email/phone/in person meetings to ask questions, discuss features, etc.Salary will be dependent on experience. Options, 401k and health insurance are also part of the compensation package.If this sounds interesting, please send me a note to chris at mercariscompany.com and let's talk. Thanks!

      Hightower, New York NY (REMOTE, H1B)http://www.gethightower.comGround floor opportunity at a commercial real estate software startup :)Commercial real estate (CRE) is one of the largest parts of our economy ($7T in U.S. asset value) but incredibly underserved by technology. We've actually met teams using different color sheets of paper to manage and track their sales pipeline. One of our investors described the opportunity as "finding the proverbial lost tribe in the amazon" [1]. If reimagining this world sounds interesting, come talk to us â€“Â we've got a product in market, just closed a 2.1M seed round, and are hiring engineer #1.Our stack is Rails + AngularJS. We've been using AngularJS since day 1 and love it (and have paid it forward in some pull requests). Our development workflow is simple and robust â€“Â Trello for task management, CircleCI for continuous integration, and deployment to Heroku.The product is a collaboration and workflow platform for CRE leasing teams. Our goals are to dramatically increase their operational efficiency with a purpose built web + mobile experience, and to leverage the underlying data to deliver performance insights to insititutional owners.Hightower is being actively piloted by some of the biggest names in CRE, and we've raised a 2.1M seed round led by BVP and Thrive Capital with participation from a host of amazing angels and VC including Aaron Levie, Lee Linden, David Tisch and Gary Vaynerhuck. Our founding team is Brandon Weber (CEO â€“Â CMU graduate and former VP @ CBRE), Niall Smart (CTO, formerly founder of YC W09 company Echodio, which sold to RealNetworks) and Donald DeSantis (CDO, formerly founder of LIFFFT, early Redfin employee).We're hiring engineer #1. Knowledge of CRE is not a pre-requisite. In fact, possibly the less you know on that front, the better :) You should have deep experience with any or all of: Rails, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Django, Node -- and a strong history of building product at startups. Meaningful equity + cash compensation is on offer for the right person.Drop me a line to learn more â€“ niall.smart (at) gethightower.com.Happy new year![1] http://www.bvp.com/blog/hightower-poised-modernize-commercia...
