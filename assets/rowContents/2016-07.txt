Hey, as usual, a friendly reminder. All positions posted here are available to search on the map.https://whoishiring.io/search/27.859/-37.178/2/Also any feedback welcome here in comments
                      
                  
      I was wondering why there were a whole 5 jobs available in a tiny town in Argentina..http://i.imgur.com/56ScCXT.pnglol, don't think that's the San Francisco you were thinking of :)
                      
                  
      Heh right. Maybe a new it hub? who knows?Thanks for the report. Fixed.

      thanks, fixed.
                      
                  
      Another friendly reminder. I collect some stats over several interesting metrics, like popularity of particular languages or specialities, etc.here http://wih.mdnbar.com/Let me know if you have some more interesting metrics in mind.
                      
                  
      This is great!I was wondering why there was a cluster seemingly not near anything in southwest Oregon; it looks like some of the remote positions are showing up as located in Remote, OR.
                      
                  
      LatLng 0,0 shows 194 jobs, most for Sydney CBD and some for other positions (remote, perth and so on).
                      
                  
      Right, 0, 0 is bad. Especially when I should be able to guess address, in this case Sydney. Let me try to fix it.As for other 0, 0, when address is unknown the decision was to leave it at 0,0. Better to have them on the map then not show them at all.
                      
                  
      Nice!
                      
                  
      Y Combinator is hiring hackers (San Francisco, ONSITE)We have a small team that makes the software that runs YC. Hardly any investors write software, but YC was started by hackers so it's natural for us to solve our problems that way.The YC software is used by a relatively small number of people â€” mostly the YC partners and founders â€” but the users are sufficiently important that through them we are able to have huge leverage. YC has ambitious plans to create more innovation in the world, and the only way to reach that level of impact is to scale through software.We're looking for a couple of great hackers to join us. It's not a job for everyone, but it could be a good fit for someone who likes startups. Working at YC, you'll get a lot of exposure to some of the best people in the startup world.If you're a hacker, have a look at the job description:

Our revamped Healthcare.gov application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to fix, and itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

We are looking to hire a C# lead to help us build out our Microsoft team.* Javascript/Python Developer: Our development environment for editing and publishing legal documents is based on the Atom editor.

      Your salary ranges are too low. In fact you should start with double the max as your low range.This is why there is a mysterious shortage of 'skilled' workers in Spain.Minimum wage low skill jobs pay more than this in the US. Heck, your workers would be better off in the rest of the EU or at least the UK.
                      
                  
      > Minimum wage low skill jobs pay more than this in the US.No, they don't. $7.25 * 40 * 52 = $15,080. Before taxes.(40 hours, assuming you are lucky enough to get full-time, which is often not the case, esp. at fast food places and such. Also 52 weeks, which is more realistic since you're not likely to get paid vacation. The $7.25 is the current minium wage for the US as a whole [1], may differ per state.)[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=minimum+wage+us&oq=minim
                      
                  
      Agreed, unfortunately it's very hard to find jobs paying properly in EU right now. It's amazing what is expected of people for the money offered.
                      
                  
      I don't think many Spaniards would feel exploited on the higher end of the bracket. Salaries in Spain are not in sync with those in SV (neither is the VC scene), and Barcelona does have a lot to offer in quality of life.Thanks for the feedback, though, it's always useful to get a honest reaction. I'll keep it in mind.
                      
                  
      The salary may be monthly. This is common in European job ads.

We find problems, improve customer experiences, and commit code every day.- Lead Software Engineer | C# | Â£30k - Â£55k | up to 0.5% | https://angel.co/openrent/jobs/143003-lead-software-engineer- Front-End Developer | Â£30k - Â£55k | up to 0.5% | https://angel.co/openrent/jobs/143011-front-end-developer- Jobs Page: https://angel.co/openrent/jobsPress Coverage:- https://angel.co/openrent/activityContact via AngelList or email in profile.Look forward to meeting you!
                      
                  
      Excited to see a platform that doesn't charge fees to tenants. The rental industry in the UK, and especially London, is ripe for disruption. No fees is a good first step. Another example, one search criteria that many renters will not compromise on is shared housing, yet many (all?) platforms do not offer this search filter.Gotta admit the salary range for the lead engineer position is worrying. You won't find anyone worth their salt for such an important role in an early stage company starting at Â£30k.
                      
                  
      +1, Â£30k is an <12 week contract in London and you'd get to keep more of it as a contractor too
                      
                  
      > You won't find anyone worth their salt for such an important role in an early stage company starting at Â£30k.Probably not at Â£55k either.
                      
                  
      Let alone "thought leaders", like the ad says they're expecting to recruit at that range.
                      
                  
      Thanks - we've done some incredible work to get where we are, but plenty of challenges ahead, and lots more to be achieved.The salary range is fairly broad, and if anyone with lots of experience comes forward we'll happily negotiate. We want incentived, smart engineers, and hopefully we're approachable enough that there shouldn't be a barrier in terms of salary / benefits. Of course, in London, we might not be able to compete with the hedge funds / banks, but I think we offer something very different.If you want to have a massive impact, and be rewarded for success, we're hopefully a great place to be. Hopefully our remuneration package is comparable / better than other similar roles - and if not, we'll certainly look to change that.Hiring isn't easy, and like with anything, we'll keep learning and developing as we go!If you're motivated and like the sound of what we're doing, don't hesitate to reach out.
                      
                  
      Bear in mind the kind of people you want to hire for a lead engineer role are unlikely to apply in the first place, on the off-chance that you'll make them an offer significantly above the advertised range.Anyway, best of luck - anything to improve the rental situation in London is very welcome!
                      
                  
      LOL. Lead developer @55k? Are you sure you aren't posting from Barcelona? How are you going to even attract anyone with seniority at those rates?
                      
                  
      I agree that most of the "Lead Developer" roles are in 60-75 bracket. Up to 0.5% equity (as opposed to share options) might be a deal-breaker...Another aspect is a "do good" mission and willingness to kick-ass.

      Kash (YC S14) | withkash.com | Full Stack Engineer | ONSITE in San Francisco, CA / Waterloo, ON, Canada / Toronto, ON, CanadaWe're on a mission to build a new payment network as an alternative to credit cards.Why? Credit cards impose a hidden tax on everything. The profit margin of your average neighborhood store is under 2%. A typical grocery storeâ€™s operating margin is around 1.7%. On the other hand, the typical cost of processing all payments is about 2%. As Priceonomics puts it, "Credit card fees are 2% or more of nearly pure profit."There has been many innovations built on top of the existing credit card network, but none of those fundamentally changes the equation. Kash is changing the equation.With the former CEO of Visa leading our board, and all the momentum we're seeing, we're confident that a new network can be built. Come chat with us to learn more if you think this is a worthy cause.We currently use: GCE/AWS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Docker, Kubernetes,

On the other hand, Trentino-Alto Adige is one of the happiest places in Italy to both live and work, but that wage isn't going to go far in the North.The additional question, not answered by the career page, would be is this a contratto a tempo indeterminato or something else?

      The Karr Lab at the Institute for Genomics & Multiscale Biology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is seeking talented, ambitious researchers to develop cutting-edge whole-cell computational models of individual cells, as well as new technologies to enable larger and more accurate whole-cell models.Despite the explosion of experimental data, we do not understand the details of how phenotype arises from genotype and the environment. We are developing whole-cell computational models which comprehensively predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by representing all of the biochemical activity inside cells. Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. For example, we believe that whole-cell models could enable bioengineers to design microbial genomes for a variety of industrial applications, as well as enable physicians to tailor medical therapy to individual patients. Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving systems biology, genomics, bioinformatics, data integration, parallel simulation, optimization, software engineering, and data visualization, and highly team-oriented.More information: Please see our website (http://www.karrlab.org/join) or contact Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).How to apply: Please send a cover letter outlining your research interests and a CV to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).
                      
                  
      Virtru | Washington, DC or REMOTE (within America) | Fulltime | JavaScript fullstack, nodejs, devops== Who we are ==https://virtru.com/how-it-worksEveryone has a right to keep their digital content private and secure. Virtru was founded with the belief that exercising that right should be easy and convenient. Virtru allows you to send end-to-end encrypted email using your existing email address and existing email provider with the flip of a switch.We have browser extensions for Chrome/Firefox, apps for iPhone and Android, and a plugin for Outlook desktop.Our full time team of ~30 is currently 50% engineers and with ~50% of the team working remotely across the US. We value automated testing, readable/maintainable code, documentation, and code reviews. We run in 2 week sprints and dedicate about 20% of total capacity to things the dev team thinks are important (technical debt, refactoring, exploring a new technology, etc), while the rest goes to feature development and addressing bugs.== Current positions ==1) Full stack NodeJS/Javascript developer (full details http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/99104/full-stack-javascript-de...)2) DevOps (I don't believe we have the a job post up yet for this, but they currently use (in no order): - AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, Lambda, CloudWatch, etc) - PagerDuty - Terraform - Ansible - Python - NodeJS - New Relic - DataDog - ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)== Get in touch ==If you care about privacy and are interested in creating security products at a company which thinks that user experience is a first class citizen, please get in touch! Send an email to jobs@virtru.com with subject â€œHN who is hiring responseâ€� and tell us what interests you about Virtru. It would be great if you can provide some sample code that we can check out (github, bitbucket, etc).
                      
                  
      == Real Talk ==I'm posting this on behalf of my company and wanted to personalize why you might want to check us out as I think copy/paste non-personalized job ads on HN are boring and don't deserve a place here.I started back with Virtru as a Senior Software Engineer in July of 2015 and work remotely. I have never once felt left out because I am remote. This is my first remote job and I cannot see how anyone would ever want to work any other way now. We currently use Slack, Google Hangouts, and Screenhero, so you won't be cut off to fend for yourself in the wild. Most of the developers are on the east coast, but we have a few people on the west coast & central.One of the more interesting things about Virtru is that a lot of work is around browser extensions, which is fairly atypical for software products, so you'll get to learn something new.
So what's working there like for a remote person? We have a stand up for the feature team at 10AM EST, and one for our DevOps. After that your day is usually in your court outside of the regular sprint end/begin activities (retro, review, planning). If you like going heads down with no/minimal distractions you can often achieve that. You won't be micromanaged to get your work done and getting your work done is the most important measure. You'll get the freedom to experience what it is to worry about only your work and not if you're showing your face for enough hours. If that means you bust ass 3 days a week and keep yourself available for the other two for stand up, possible reviews and questions, and maybe a meeting no one should care.Rather than write a novel, if you have any questions please contact me via running this JS snippet to get my info:    [103, 114, 101, 103, 43, 104, 110, 64, 118, 105, 114, 116, 114, 117, 46, 99, 111, 109].map(x => String.fromCharCode(x)).join('')
                      
                  
      I applied via the contact email and specified the DevOps position. Is there anything else you guys would like me to do as a Ops person to better evaluate my abilities as a person and expedite the process. This company sounds like a great fit for me.

      That would be illegal in the U.S. Uber shouldn't even do this for international office.
                      
                  
      I'm not certain but it appears that it is not illegal to discriminate based on the school's ranking in the hiring process. It would, however, be illegal if it were based on a demographic stereotype a school is associated with.That said, it still might not be a good idea to reject people just based on their school's rank.

With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer.

      Bangalore, India. Many Positions. Full time.I have taken up a role to build a payment network from scratch, out of Bangalore, India. It is funded by a big corporation, but will be arms-distance from their central business.It is a large, complex and fascinating problem to crack. The potential to bring banking to 600 million un/underbanked Indians is what excited me to work on this.We are looking to hire a good core team of full time math, physics and CS majors, UI UX and product managers, who will work of Bangalore, India.We are open to hiring people from around the world but they will need to work out of Bangalore.Looking for full time and in exceptional cases, consultants, welcome.I have posted and have hired a few good candidates from Who's Hiring threads.Since my first post, we have now released a product and also secured a payment bank license.We also have our payment network baked into banks and mass transit.In the past I have built both fast-data and big-data companies and have a few patents in this space.If you are interested, please email me at google's email service - takenottie.Thanks for reading.
