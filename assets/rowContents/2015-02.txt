      Sorry if this is a bit off-topic, but I was wondering where you get the National Rail train data from. Is it based on the open data from ATOC/RSP or do you have your own agreement from them?I ask as I was thinking about writing a lib to parse and use the ATOC 'fares data', and just wanted to know if anyone has had any success with it. The format is well documented but a bit massive (80 page specification), before getting started would be nice to know if the data is actually useful. Their site says it is updated infrequently which made me a bit hesitant, and I don't think I've seen any projects where it's been used. Love your app by the way!

      FYI, if you interview with these guys, be prepared to be left hanging. I did a coding interview with them and heard absolutely nothing back afterwards. Whether or not a company wants to hire you, it's common courtesy to at least respond with "we've decided to consider other candidates" or whatever. Saying nothing is poor form.
                      
                  
      Not condoning what they did, but saying nothing seems to be par for the course, based on limited personal experience, and a lot of chatter from colleagues the past few years.  Sad, but true.
                      
                  
      Just because behavior is common doesn't mean it's acceptable or should be tolerated. Companies expect candidates to be professional and can't send a simple email? What else would they be cutting corners on?
                      
                  
      Agreed, behavior like this should be shared.I wonder if any companies know/care how much this kind of behavior negatively impacts people's perception of them.
                      
                  
      How do you "not tolerate" it?  Send them a nasty email?  Create a 'wall of shame'?One thing I've heard from larger companies is they often do  not say anything because almost anything can be construed in to a lawsuit.  I think this is a bit of a copout, and I think in most cases, it's just easier to do nothing, but the lawsuit thing probably isn't a total non-issue for some companies either."Thank you for your time and interest.  We were faced with a tough choice with a lot of candidates, and we ultimately went with another candidate for this position" seems as inoffensive and bland as could be - why these aren't sent out it, I don't know.
                      
                  
      Job poster here. I definitely do try to let the candidates know of the outcome once they make it past the coding interview phase. throwawaybcporn completed his interview fairly recently and a decision on that round of interviews had not been made yet. The candidates will hear back this week.As with any startup, we are a small team doing a million things, and sometimes things (such as interview rounds) may take longer than they should because a critical need for the business was prioritized.
                      
                  
      > We use Grails, Groovy,> be prepared to be left hangingIf you work on these technologies, the future's a bit iffy for now whoever you work for. I'm guessing though, based on Graeme Rocher's comments a week ago [1], that he'll roll Groovy into Grails to make a single project, and get funding for both as a rump team under one project management, himself.[1] http://jaxenter.com/grails-future-113958.html
                      
                  
      Thanks for the interview. Since I only interviewed very few people from my post last month, I have a good idea of who you are.The reason you haven't heard back yet is because the most recent interview round is still on-going and a decision has not been reached yet. You should expect to hear back this week.

      Collective Health, ( http://collectivehealth.com/#careers ), San Mateo, CA (Full time, on-site only)We're a startup looking to replace health insurance with a system where incentives are aligned for the benefit of both employees as well as employers.In the long term, we think we can bend the cost of health care across the country.  Or in another way of saying it, we can lower both the first and second derivative of the rising health care cost curve, nationwide.  We've got some compelling evidence for it as well if you'd like to chat.Our tech stack is an SOA/microservices mix of Go and Java with an Angular front end.  We're strong believers in transparency, trust and balance.  We believe good code is easy to read and should have a short "time to understanding".  We also believe that shipping is important and there are appropriate times to leverage technical debt.Some of our company-wide values are transparency and a superior customer experience, from the way we design our products and over-indexing on customer support.Our eng team is around 9 and we're well funded, but still just a year old, so early enough for non-trivial equity.  We've got a ton of interesting problems to solve.  We expect all of our engineers to teach as well as learn.We're looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack, front end, back end, data, dev ops, test, generalist, etc.  Full list of available positions: https://jobs.lever.co/collectivehealthWe're super proud of the company mission, engineering culture and tech stack we've put together and would love a chance to explain it all in detail!

      Spatch - London, UK - Full Time (CAN OFFER VISA / RELOCATION SPONSORSHIP) - DevOps, Front-end, and Back-endWeâ€™re creating a new form of communication. Email is over 40 years old and doesnâ€™t support many modern use-cases. Most messaging alternatives arenâ€™t decentralized or federated. We think thereâ€™s an opportunity to create a modern, federated messaging platform with mutable, collaborative objects being at the heart of it (i.e. tasks, events, etc -- but the objects could be anything). What would happen if you took the best components of email (IMAP/SMTP), chat (IRC/XMPP) and collaboration (Wave)... and created a federated platform and new set of open protocols around it? Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re building. Spatch is backed by some of the top US and European venture capital investors. Spatch is an equal opportunity employer.We'd love to get to know you fellow HN'ers.Email: jobs@spatch.co

      Core Engineer at VC-funded open-source project, Weaveworks, LondonWeaveworks is a start-up founded by the team that created RabbitMQ and backed by one of the worldâ€™s leading tech investors. Headquartered in London, we are hiring engineers to work on our open source software product, Weave.The purpose of Weave is to enable all developers, no matter what their background, to take advantage of container technologies such as Docker and build better software applications. We believe that containers will lead to much more software being built at greater speed and scale than ever before, so much so that many existing approaches will need to be reimagined.We have an experienced team and welcome newcomers who want to progress fast, as well as domain experts in relevant technologies. Currently Weave is a set of network services written in Go, packaged to make distributed Docker applications much easier to construct. But we have considerable ambitions, and the space is evolving rapidly, so we especially seek developers with the right outlook and ability to adapt.Ideally you have real world experience of building and running systems with a focus on resilience and uptime. You are as comfortable designing or debugging a distributed protocol as you are talking to customers building a web app or scaling a data service.We hope to meet developers who share our values:- Complete focus on the simplest possible user experience- A real desire to innovate, and then measure success by happy customers not kudos from purists- Relish being held accountable for work quality, but want to own how that work is done- Want to participate in shaping the culture and technology of a fast moving company- We communicate clearly and we respect everyone who uses our softwareIn short, you would be working on a highly visible and ambitious open source project with all the opportunities and responsibilities that come with that. We aim to be a market leader and want people who really feel they could be a big part of the team making that happen.More info and application form at: http://weave.works/jobs/
                      
                  
      What would you do?You will write code in Go to create flexible, easy-to-use tools for containers in development and in production. You will design and implement new tools for monitoring and managing container networks. You will help shape our vision of containerized software development. You will solve customer issues, write blogs to describe what you've done and participate in conferences and hackathons to grow your skills and reputation.

      Search Product Manager - New York, San Francisco, London, BerlinAt Mapzen we take a different approach to the core components of mapping: open source, open data, open access. We make modular tools for building better maps because we believe that healthy mapping ecosystems are ones that are diverse, sustainable, and accessible to all.We're building a geocoder on top of entirely open data. We're providing it for use as a hosted service and designed it for modular use and improvement by developers. Geocoding and search are among the most complex problems in open source mapping today, and we believe that the best way to solve those problems is to build open services, software, and community around better search and better data.As product manager, you will help and guide a team of developers toward our feature, quality, and community goals. You'll have an understanding of current open datasets (and be on the lookout for new ones) and an interest in figuring out how they can fit together for geocoding. Your perspective is global, with an appreciation for diverse addressing systems and ideas about how to build software that works for everyone. You know how to assess quality search results, and how to investigate and improve results that fall short of user expectations.More info here: https://mapzen.com/jobs/search-product-manager

Our community of over 4 million teachers connects and shares knowledge on the site every day, and has generated almost $150 million in sales of some of the best, original, most creative classroom resources.Now, for you.  Do you love what Github has done for software?  Can you imagine having to write a web server from scratch every time you build a website? Do you love being a developer that's standing on the shoulders of giants?  That's what we're doing for teachers at TpT - creating a culture and marketplace to empower teachers.  Every teacher out there knows what it's like to work a full day in the classroom and then work all night putting together lesson plans for the next day.  TpT is where they can find other teachers who've dealt with the same problem and are putting up their crafted resources for sale.I'm putting together a 'dream team' so to speak of engineers who will be the core of our NYC team.  The site is currently PHP with NGINX and MySQL on either end.  However, we're playing with Ruby quite a bit and tend to be polyglots.* Software Engineer - http://grnh.se/l56nvo

      That was fun. But systemd? Talk about controversial.
                      
                  
      I think they're referring to this one:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_D"System D (in French, SystÃ¨me D) is a shorthand term that refers to a manner of responding to challenges that requires one to have the ability to think fast, to adapt, and to improvise when getting a job done. The letter D refers back to either of the French nouns "dÃ©brouille",[1] dÃ©brouillardise[2] or dÃ©merde (French slang). The verbs se dÃ©brouiller and se dÃ©merder mean to make do, to manage, especially in an adverse situation."

      New York (or remote)Unique opportunity to create a niche SaaS startup based on a fully functioning market-leading product.A thriving New York-based multi-location dog daycare/boarding company is seeking the right person (or team of two people) to spin-off its internal webapp system into a startup SaaS business and lead and build the resulting venture.There is an attractive opportunity to productize and sell this webapp service to other daycare/boarding companies nationwide (and beyond?) for a monthly subscription.The webapp was built by former a Google/MIT guy (who co-owns the dog daycare business) with some collaborators along the way. It's a reasonably-sized Python/Django/Javascript app and has been in daily use and continuing improvement for over two years.We created this webapp because available services for dog daycare/boarding companies were clunky and limited, as typical for software for niche industries. We're confident that whoever takes on this challenge will be able to hit the ground running with a market-leading service.The right person (or pair) should have exceptional technical skills, a combination of product development and customer discovery skills, and the hunger to create and run a thriving niche SaaS business. And a true love for dogs!If interested, get in touch with Ien at ien@alum.mit.edu.

      Your https://www.societyofgrownups.com/careers is 500 Server Error. Couldn't get any additional info
                      
                  
      Could you clarify how the front-end developers are using Node.js? It seems pretty exlusively a back-end tool.
                      
                  
      Good catch! I said "front-end developer" but really we're just looking for smart full-stack developers or Javascript developers who are comfortable working across the stack. I've updated my post to reflect that.
                      
                  
      Not that it applies to this post, but even though most of the projects I work on don't have nodejs on the server, the dev machine is running nodejs for build management. I probably wouldn't ask for a nodejs developer just to run grunt/gulp but I do like for all my front-end devs to play with nodejs so they at least know how their tools work a bit. After all, I wouldn't really want someone who spends their days writing javascript for the browser but isn't interested in using nodejs to customize their cli tools, at least.
                      
                  
      My guess is that Node is responsible for serving the HTML/CSS/JS that's used by the front-end, and probably providing an isomorphic Ember endpoint down the road. So probably in the realm of knowledge that a front-end dev would need, but not a front-end tool in that it doesn't run in the browser.
                      
                  
      Yeah, we're definitely interested in seeing what's possible with isomorphic Ember or React code. We don't necessarily require Javascript developers to come in with Node.js knowledge, but they should be interested in learning and a desire to holistically understand the web stack they're building on.

      Clara Labs (https://claralabs.com/, YC S14) - San Francisco, Engineering, Full-TimeClara is building the simplest possible interface to getting work done.Every person on our team is involved in the thinking that creates their work - full stack in the broadest sense of the term. This means identifying, owning, and driving projects to completion.We believe shipping early and frequently builds better products. An extreme example: we scheduled thousands of meetings entirely manually for our first Clara customers before building any software at all.Accepting human dependency is the fastest way to building useful machine intelligence. The failure of intelligence products to date has fundamentally been a failure to build trust.  It is the consequence of unreliability and lack of focus (think: Siri).

But we're coming up with a new name and an entirely new brand (something more befitting of a tech company), and we've got a really awesome product that is already used by several $1B+ companies and is changing the way they think about S&OP.Our tech stack is quite exciting: AngularJS on the frontend (which is most relevant to this job posting), Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and Elasticsearch on the backend.We pay quite well, fully pay for health insurance on a low deductible plan (no monthly premiums for you), and have a great vacation/time off policy. Our team is smart and fun to be around.Please get in touch at tech@operationalresults.com if you'd like more info!

      Optimizely -- San FranciscoWe're especially looking to hire an experienced Dev Ops engineer, but we're always hiring and we'd love to talk to anyone who's at all technical to see if we can find a fit. Check us out! https://www.optimizely.com/jobs?gh_src=fuvi7pAnd here's our blurb:
Optimizely was founded by two former Google product managers, Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen. Dan served as the Director of Analytics during the Obama 2008 presidential campaign. While there, his team relied on the use of A/B and multivariate testing to maximize e-mail sign-ups, volunteers, and donations to raise more than $100 million in additional revenue for the campaign.But optimization was hard â€” you needed technical skills and know-how to run even the simplest of tests. After the campaign, Siroker teamed up with Koomen to create a world-class optimization platform that was easy to use in an effort to provide a platform for businesses to be able to conceive and run experiments that helped them make better data-driven decisions.Since completing YCombinator in the winter of 2010, Optimizely has seen strong and growing demand.
