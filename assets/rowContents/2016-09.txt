      Please don't list an arduous application process and then say "if you don't feel qualified for the position." It's rude and feeds imposter syndrome.
                      
                  
      I apologize and I'll remove that bit. It was not my intention to feed impostor syndrome and we try to do the opposite by being supportive and encouraging of current and potential contributors.
                      
                  
      WalmartLabs | Portland, Oregon | iOS Engineer | Onsite - Relocation Expenses Provided | $100k-160k + bonus + stockI'm an architect at WalmartLabs and am looking for a few good iOS engineers to help us build our iPhone app.  If working at scale in a small, startup-like environment gets you out of bed in the morning, you'll probably enjoy this gig - we're one of the most downloaded apps of all time, and we serve tens of millions of users a month.We have a nice office in the heart of downtown Portland, and serve up the usual Silicon Valley style benefits: flexible hours, four weeks of PTO plus holidays, 401k, health care, free drinks and snacks, etc.  Salary is highly competitive with Bay Area salaries, and you'll get to live in Portland, which has considerably lower overhead.  If you're a good fit, we'll make it work for you.Interested?https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/123996/ios-engineer-walmartla... or email me (Spencer Miles) directly at smiles@walmartlabs.com
                      
                  
      You might spell out 'Oregon' for anyone searching more broadly than Portland.  OR, or even ", OR" generally turn up a lot of false positives.
                      
                  
      Small, start-up like environment. At Wal-Mart, a Fortune-1 company. Think about it. (Also, having worked there ... um ... no. The place is worse than Oracle.)
                      
                  
      Sorry you had a bad experience. I work in the Portland office and that hasn't been my experience at all. We have maybe 20-30 people and wide latitude over the projects we work on. Prior to this I had only worked in startups of 15 people or less. This experience has not been all that different for me, except that we're not constrained by resources. Our managers are former startup guys. It's honestly been great for me, to my initial surprise.
                      
                  
      I've actually heard really positive things about Walmart Labs from the Node community.They've even built and open sourced the popular framework hapi (http://hapijs.com).
                      
                  
      Nearly every single one of those guys has left, and for very good reason. Ask around.
                      
                  
      As usual, upvoting all the posts the list the salary range in the heading. I encourage others to do the same. #TalkPay ;)
                      
                  
      Your email address is awesome. :)

      David | San Francisco, CA | https://www.senddavid.com | FullÂ­time | Onsite
David is a San Francisco-Â­based software startup that combines technology and legal research to help customers resolve disputes with their cable, internet, or wireless service provider.The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.We currently have a MVP (https://www.senddavid.com) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80Â­-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-Â­4.0% | https://angel.co/david-174/jobs/72943-engineerContact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com

      Credit Karma | San Francisco | Full Time, OnsiteCredit Karma's mission is to make financial progress possible for everyone. We have over 60 million US members and are a true mission-oriented business, a rare case where our incentives are aligned with our users - we succeed by helping our members attain financial progress.We've been growing rapidly over the past few years (hypergrowth) and are hiring across a wide range of positions. On the backend side, we are moving to Scala-based microservices using finagle and Thrift, and as well as GraphQL on node.js. Our native iOS and Android apps are #1 in finance (with a 5 star rating on the App Store) and we're rebuilding our website in React + Redux. Our data science team uses Kafka, Spark and BigQuery among other technologies.If you're motivated by growth and impact Credit Karma is probably the best place to work in tech today. We have solved product / market fit and distribution, but compared to our peer unicorns there is still so much work to do. If you look at the gap between our product today and what we are well-positioned to become - the main touchpoint for consumer finance - there is tons of opportunity for people joining now to take on responsibility and ownership and have a meaningful impact.Feel free to reach out to me personally (scott.shumaker at creditkarma dot com) or visit:

We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal.Weâ€™re still a relatively small company with only 10 people in the backend engineering team and 50 people in total.

Broadly, the work weâ€™re doing covers these areas:*  Distributed platform: We aim to be the first bank without a single point of failure*  Banking and payments: We write code that moves money*  Product engineering: We help our customers by hiding the boring parts of money management*  Financial crime: We need to stay ahead of criminals trying to steal data and money*  Internal tooling: We automate everything so the rest of the team can work smarterOur backend architecture is composed of hundreds of distributed Go microservices running in the cloud. They are managed by Kubernetes, store data in Cassandra, do RPC with linkerd/Finagle, and use Kafka for asynchronous queueing.Lots more detail is on our website : https://boards.greenhouse.io/mondo/jobs/244898

      > [...] and we're open to remote working as long as you can spend around 20% of your time in London.Is there any flexibility on that requirement?
                      
                  
      Potentially; we don't have many remote employees yet (but we'd love to in the future) so we're still finding our way with it.
                      
                  
      Hey, I know you occasionally take interns. Are you still open to that?
                      
                  
      Absolutely. We don't have an ad up for internships specifically (we probably should!), but you can fill out the backend application and mention you're looking for an internship :)
                      
                  
      What kind of salary you would offer to these interns?
                      
                  
      Could the internship be remote?
                      
                  
      I'd say it's unlikely, but anything is possible.

https://tubitv.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk068xc/- Android Engineers($120k-$175k): We are hiring both Jr and Sr Android Engineers to work on our very popular app that has over 8M installs and close to 2M monthly active users.If you'd like to chat more first, shoot me an email and mention HN (marios at tubitv dot com).
                      
                  
      Why is the iOS salary lower than Android?
                      
                  
      Same question, seems they are either looking for a junior dev or they just don't know market rate for an iOS dev.

      I'd be really interested in this, but in reading the description, it sounds like you want German and English.  Could you live with English and Italian, provided that everything else is there?
                      
                  
      Wouldn't it be illegal to discriminate against Italian speakers in the Confederazione svizzera?
                      
                  
      I don't know, but I'm not even concerned with that.  For one, I'm not a Swiss citizen - I'd have work rights through my EU citizenship.  Second, with any work that I do, I want to be successful.  If everyone is speaking German, I'm not going to be too productive.  If they can handle my English or Italian, then we're in business.I live in the US, and it's common to want certain language(s) for our various roles.  We don't have a national language ourselves.

Engineers: We have always maintained a small, but high-caliber engineering team, and we are now looking to make a couple of additions.We are tech stack agnostic.

      Your career page mentions housing as a perk. That's a first for me. 
I do not match any profile but I'd recommend friends.
                      
                  
      Thank you! What is your craft?
                      
                  
      Being tech stack agnostic is fair, but it'd be good to mention your current (or preferred) tech stack.
                      
                  
      Backend: Java

      You mention you're hiring a backend engineer. Are you looking for mid-level/senior engineers as well? What is the compensation band you guys are offering?
                      
                  
      Yes, mid-level/senior engineers are welcome!I'm just a geek at this place who hangs out at HN. The folks over at careers@locus.sh would do a better job with questions about compensation. I do know that the payscale (salary, perks, ESOPs) here is pretty good by Indian standards, given that we have Series-A funding, and that compensation is often kept on low priority during hiring decisions.

      Kaggle | San Francisco | Full Time | ONSITE or REMOTE | Software EngineeringTechnologies: C#; ASP.NET MVC; React; TypeScript; Docker; Azure.You can read the job req and apply here: 
http://kaggle.applytojob.com/apply/GjSjOi/Backend-EngineerKaggle is best known as a platform for machine learning competitions. We have a community of over 600K data scientists. Now also building a sharing-and-collaboration platform (closest analogy is Github for data science: https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)Particularly interesting opportunity for software engineers looking for exposure to data science/machine learning. Three of our engineers have come via HN posts, so we take HN referrals very seriously.
                      
                  
      This is the third month in a row I've seen this posting. I finally worked up the courage to apply and I got shot down immediately. The posting reads to be liberal with the experience levels sought and how much a candidate is willing to learn, so I figured if you're still looking then I would surely have a shot; I have 10 years of C# experience and experience with TypeScript/Angular2 in an enterprise application. 
I think I was judged purely off the fact that I don't have any open-source contributions. As a family-man with a full-time commitment to my work, there's not enough time to contribute to OS projects, i'm sorry. If you're excluding people just for the lack of public contributions, then you're missing out on a lot of great experienced talent.
                      
                  
      Seems like we're in a similar boat :)10+ years c# experience trying to get a remote job. Limited open source b/c family and company policy. Also interviewed with Kaggle.If you think misery loves company, contact <username>@gmailMaybe we can trade tips.
                      
                  
      Before moving down to the bay area and working at YourMechanic I interviewed with them as well. I had one phone and one take home project before getting to talk to an engineer. The guy honestly seemed more interested in my oil and gas projects and what connections I had to the industry than actually hiring anyone. He didn't ask any technical or software related questions. I got the vibe they're a little disorganized and in search of diversifying their product.This was close to two years ago, so it might be different now.
                      
                  
      Did you get any feedback. Might just be they want high volume public facing experience rather than enterprise. Given what you said you should have got a bit further though IMO.

      Converge | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineers | Onsite | Full-time | Drones / Mobile / Web App* We're an enterprise software startup (seed stage) that makes it easy for skilled professionals (think construction, insurance, real estate, etc) to use drones everyday in their job through a combination of incredible AI and HRI. We're generating revenue and among our customers, count a Fortune 50 company.
* Looking for junior or senior software engineers, and (paid) interns. We're less concerned with your skill set and more about what you would find motivating to work on every day. We do work that spans everything from Drones to AI to Data Viz to IOT.About Converge:
* Started in 2015, our founders were some of the first people to work on drones in the world, worked on the unmanned Blackhawk helicopter, and created the first mobile app ever for flying a drone (way back in 2008 at MIT...)
* We like people who have excelled at something outside of work, and are just downright interesting to have a conversation with.
* We like diamonds in the rough, but like to keep high expectations for each other.
* If you are looking for a keg, ping pong table or bro culture, we're not going to be a good fit for each other. We actually do fly drones for our job, so I guess that's a culture benefit?
* Our team is small, we're very deliberate about hiring- you would be in the first 10 employees.To get started, please go to this page to get ahold of us: http://www.cvg.io/careers/If you come from an underrepresented group in tech, please get in touch w/ me (@edave) directly via my HackerNews portfolio.Some buzzwords for you keyword searchers: iOS, Android, Fullstack, Rails, Python, Ruby, React, ES6, Angular, Machine Learning

      Company sounds really cool and I am very interested - what's with the email address? is it that string you posted "aXRzYXVuaXhzeXN0ZW0raG5AaXRlcmFibGUuY29t" @ iterable.com?
                      
                  
      I don't mean to antagonize, since any more detail would give away the answer -- but a qualified candidate should recognize various encoding outputs, even if they can't immediately identify the specific encoding scheme."It's a unix system, I know this."
                      
                  
      Woops got it thanks.

      Hi Luke,I tried applying through the link you shared.However, upon reaching this page: https://precisionnutrition.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=5The 'Apply for this job' button fails to send a request back to the server. I noticed you guys are using Bamboo Hr to process incoming applications, and I believe the bug resides inside Bamboo's JQuery, as two events listening to the button appear to be called by Bamboo Hr.As '...jobs/view.php' plus the job id(which is 5 for this one) as a GET parameter is your websites way of exposing job applications, I took a guess that the button was meant to request '.../jobs/apply?id=5'. Loading that page in my browser was very promising as an application form was rendered!But now this page appears to be either deprecated or is an artifact: https://precisionnutrition.bamboohr.com/jobs/apply.php?id=5As you can see, the styling is suspiciously bare-bone and there is no submit button.Now I could try to craft a POST request by using the form field names and appending my information manually, and perhaps get lucky, but then I still wouldn't know for sure that my application reached anyone at your company.So here I give up my quest to force my resume onto your server, and am making this account to make this request:Please advise how I may send you guys my resume to apply for this position.

Any info on your tech stack? Can you define "Competitive salary"? Otherwise looks really interesting :) Will keep an eye on and send my CV if you can answer some of the questions above.

      don't go here, they will give you a task for 2 weeks, and when you did everything right, they will never reply back to you. You'll have no chance to proof you're right, they just ignore you. They also don't understand CS fundamentals
