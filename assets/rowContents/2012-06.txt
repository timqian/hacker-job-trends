      Amsterdam, The Netherlands. H1B[1]Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a developer there currently working on search and relocated over there about a year and a half ago, and have been very happy with it.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it.
We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and a few CPAN modules.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it.You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a couple of times before and have already helped get one person hired, many others have had or are having interviews, and I've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent.

      SF - Rails - HALF-TIME-ISH :)I've mentioned before that we have a couple of engineers who work half-time-ish (and do their own things the rest of the time) and it got some positive feedback: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3850480We're ready to hire a couple more in this vein, so if it sounds interesting let me know!=========Advantages for you:- you get 2-3 extra weekend days for fun and profit- we provide health insurance and all that jazz- if some weeks you don't have lots to do and want to work more, and other weeks you have lots to do and want to work less, we can be flexible- we're profitable and growing! so if you decide "wow I really love Verba and want to spend every waking moment there" we can make that dream come trueAdvantages for us:- you have more time to learn new things, meet new people and generally be a friendlier, happier, more knowledgeable person in our workplace- we can hire faster with less anxiety (instead of the "gulp i just committed $100k/yr" feeling, we have the "smaller gulp i just committed $50k/yr" feeling :)- you get to be a part of what we're doing, we get to hear about all the cool stuff you're doing, and that can only lead to good things for both of usAnyway, I've included our spiel and "what we're looking for" summary below, so shoot me an email if you're interested (ragalie@verbasoftware.com).========The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.We're a B2B company working with just about 200 colleges and universities, and we're looking for people familiar with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck. The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.Be sure to check out our website (http://www.verbasoftware.com) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us.

      New York, NY - Software Engineer - FulltimeCanvas Networks (USV Funded) is looking for engineers #3 and #4 to join a small close team building the rich-media community platform of the future.The job title says "Software Engineer" but really we're looking for "Software Entrepreneur" or a "Startup Engineer". Yes, your day job will be writing code. But that's the only similarity to a big company software job. You'll be challenged to take big ideas and turn them into concrete testable hypotheses. Shipping a great feature is important, but positively changing user behavior is the ultimate success criteria. Built-to-spec takes a backseat to moves-the-metrics.More details and how to apply: http://canv.as/jobs

      Upvoted for the well written post, but a quick question:Why are you guys using Ruby? Is it the better libraries for client side JS libraries like Ember? It seems that you may eventually need some of the tools that Numpy or Scipy provide and the difference between Rails and Django (or Pylons or Flask) don't seem like a big enough gap. Of course you could use ZeroMQ (or whatever) to communicate between the two, but unless there is a big reason, why divide up your back end?

We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers.

      San Francisco, IOS Developer. Full Time.Weâ€™re inventing a new kind of photography for when photos just arenâ€™t enough. Close your eyes and imagine your favourite memory - say christmas morning as a kid. Youâ€™re probably not thinking of a rectangle in a void (i.e. a picture), nor are you thinking of a moving rectangle in a void (i.e. a movie), youâ€™re probably thinking of an entire world that youâ€™re standing in the center of. We make an IOS app that allows you to save this entire moment into a seamless spherical photograph called a bubble that you can save and share with others.Weâ€™re a small, three person team - the intern who made Yelpâ€™s Monocle, a designer from Cooper Union and a computer vision genius. We raised $2 million in a heavily oversubscribed round of funding from August Capital. We spoke at TED (sorry, no video!), have offices on union square in San Francisco and have an app that has an unparalleled ability to induce uncontrolled smiles of glee when people first see it.Weâ€™re looking for someone to be our point person for IOS development. We actually all have IOS experience (and really cool app in progress), but weâ€™re looking for someone to grab the bull by the horns and focus on IOS full time (as the two engineers are focused on computer vision and â€˜all the other boring engineeringâ€™ respectively). Youâ€™ll be a pretty big deal at our company. Weâ€™re pretty lucky in that our technology spans everywhere from advanced computer vision to WebGL and HTML5 to Python, PostgreSQL and Memcached to low-level run-loop optimizations for UI responsiveness and Core Animation magic.  It's a lot of fun.Send me an e-mail at ben@bubb.li

      San Francisco, CA (Mission District) - awe.smWe're looking for front-end, back-end, and full-stack engineers. (H1B okay)We're building conversion tracking for social media -- "SendGrid for sharing", if you like.Most sites and apps are currently doing a really poor job of measuring where social traffic comes from, and how valuable it is in terms of page views, signups and sales. We save people from reinventing the wheel by providing a set of APIs to integrate into their application that make it easy to generate shares and track the performance of different networks and campaigns. The APIs are written in Ruby and PHP right now, sitting on top of a mixture of MySQL and Redis, but we are pretty language-agnostic and pick the right tool for the job. The back-end challenges are all about taking lots of data and processing it scalably, as fast as possible.We also have a GUI, a modern Javascript single-page app written using Backbone that sits on top of our APIs. It's all about allowing custmers to explore their data and find what's important.http://totally.awe.sm/jobsWe're currently 13 people, with a goal of 14-16, of which 8 will be engineers. We have a great location in an awesome neighbourhood with an amazing view ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) and have catered lunches, full health, vision and dental coverage.We use an internal IRC server for team communication. If that makes you say "yay!" then you will definitely fit in.

Our pre-pregnancy genomic test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 1% of all births in the United States.As you might imagine, handling this kind of volume puts us in terra incognita. Our situation is similar to the one faced by Amazon in the 90s, before anyone knew how to scale an operation with such highly interconnected physical and informational components.To solve the problems associated with scaling the medical genome, we hire generalists rather than specialists. Our engineers are pragmatists who know when to use machine learning and when to use a simple regex, and understand in what sense those approaches are at different ends of a continuum. Many did not have a bioinformatics background before they joined, but all had strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms.Experience in general means little to us as genomics is a young field; working code means quite a lot more. If this sounds like your kind of company, we invite you to apply.About youYou should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science (or equivalent) and significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by Github account, personal web page, or prior employment.You should also be a generalist, interested in rotating through the engineering team and working in one or more of these areas:- Genomics: design, validate, and optimize clinical genomic assays for rare Mendelian variants- Machine Learning and Data Science: extract meaning out of one of the largest clinical genomic datasets in the world- Robotics: automate and scale our backend to do more clinical sequencing and genotyping than anyone has ever done before- UI/UX: design the first widely adopted user interface for the medical genome- Clinical Integration: solve the wide variety of practical issues associated with translating genomics into a clinical context- Infrastructure: build and deploy the hardware and software systems that support secure, large-scale computations on genomic datasetsFrom a skills perspective, you should have familiarity with several of the following technologies. We obviously donâ€™t expect you to know everything on the list, but you should be nodding to yourself by the end of it.- Python: Django, Numpy, Scipy, Cython- HTML/CSS/JS: Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap 2, HTML5 APIs, Chrome Web Inspector- C++: STL, gcc/g++, Boost, C++11- Functional Programming: Haskell, underscore.js, functional reactive programming- Data Science and Visualization: GNU GSL, CUDA, Netlib/LAPACK, graphviz, R, Matlab, Matplotlib, Numerical Recipes- DevOps/System Administration: Amazon Web Services, Puppet, nginx, nagios, Apache, Fabric- APIs: REST, JSON, SOA, and all that jazz- Biological Databases: NCBI, UCSC, 1000 Genomes, Hapmap, UK10K- Sequencing/Computational Biology: OLB, samtools/pysam, pygr, galaxy/bxpython, kent utilities- Unix/Linux: bash/zsh, emacs/vim, git, GNU toolchain- PostgreSQL: psycopg2, hstore, replication- Security: skipfish, SSL, fuzz testing, preventing XSS & SQL injectionsAgain, please consider these guidelines, not absolutes. For example, if you know Chef, we figure you can learn Puppet, and if you know Ruby, we figure you can learn Python.In general, you should enjoy taking care of the practical last mile problems needed to actually achieve a societal ROI on the world's multibillion dollar investment in the Human Genome Project.What you'll do:- Move fast without breaking things :)
- Start in the areas you're familiar with, and grow to work on the full stack
- Work closely with a small, tight-knit team
- Develop algorithms and code for all aspects of clinical genomics, from machine learning to supply chain optimization to insurance billing

      Sonian (Newton, MA) - Full time, local or remoteWe're a funded (recently closed Series C) email archiving startup with many large corporate customers. We are looking for an additional engineer for our operations (or "devops" if you prefer) team, to take us from merely using configuration management and automated deploys to delivering our internal services as dependable, multi-IaaS-portable tools that empower everyone from support engineers to Clojure backend developers to solve customer issues without paging us and use our monitoring API to automatically spin up instances to process work.We have offices outside of Boston (Newton), but our dev and ops teams are mostly remote, and we meet over VOIP and pair-program in tmux.Some highlights of what we do:  +   We manage hundreds of compute instances across multiple clouds, including over a petabyte of data.
  +   We write the code to help facilitate deploying our application to new public clouds.
  +   We automate everything we possibly can
  +   We build up awesome applications, and then opensource them (Perhaps you've heard of our monitoring framework Sensu - https://github.com/sensu )
  +   We build applications to manage every aspect of our compute and storage infrastructure, from deploying code, to provisioning systems on multiple clouds, to securing access control.  For every problem - there is a code solution.
  +   We have an awesome time working together on technologies that very few (if any) other companies are doing today.
  +   We have days where all we do is hack on a specific project (http://blog.petecheslock.com/2012/02/13/why-your-company-should-have-internal-hackdays/) - leave the day-to-day tasks for the next day.
  +   We meet up 2-3 times a year in Boston - with the rest of the company.

What are we looking for in a new member of our team?  +   Excitement, energy and a willingness to learn something new.
  +   The ability to take a task from idea to code to testing to deploy (all within a short amount of time).
  +   Bring new ideas around project or processes to the team - if we like it - we'll do it.
  +   You can work from home, from our Newton, MA headquarters, or your local coffee shop.  Anywhere with Internet access.
  +   You'll be part of an on-call rotation with the rest of our team.
  +   Flexible person who can work by themselves or pair with their team to teach or learn.

What are some things you should know or have worked with before? (Some, many or all)  +   Ruby (must know or want to learn)
  +   Not required, but pluses: Python (used by some parts of our infrastructure), Clojure (used by our backend team)
  +   Chef (or other configuration management systems), Fog
  +   Rails, Sinatra (both also used by our front-end team)
  +   Git or other DVCS
  +   System administration with Ubuntu (includes security, logging, monitoring, web/SQL admin, etc, etc)
  +   Knowledge of Openstack (especially Swift) is a plus
  +   A love for making complex configuration and systems simple via automation
  +   Continuous Deployment, Agile Development/Kanban
  +   Contributing to open source

Interested? - Contact pete.cheslock@sonian.com or https://twitter.com/petecheslock, and let him know you saw this post. Please include a short summary of why you think you would be a good fit, resume/blog/etc, and a link to a Github account or other code samples.

      San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Almost every technological and medical innovation in the world has its roots in a scientific paper. Science drives much of the worldâ€™s innovation. The faster science moves, the faster the world moves.It's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. We are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate. The stakes are high. If the inefficiencies in science can be removed, we may be able to accelerate science by a factor of 2, leading to a huge impact for humanity.For more on the problem Academia.edu is solving, see the guest post on TechCrunch last Sunday on 'The Future of Science' by Academia.edu's founder, Richard Price http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/
Academia.edu has over 1.3 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.We recently raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We need talented engineers to come and help us with the mission. We have a strong engineering culture. We're an 11 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:â˜… tools for scientists to share their work faster and more openlyâ˜… algorithms to mine our data, and to find out what research is trending in real timeâ˜… back-end infrastructure to scale the site on AWSWhat we're looking for are:â˜€ 2+ years of web development experienceâ˜€ Experience with the full engineering stackâ˜€ Passion for engineeringAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture.There is more information here http://academia.edu/hiring. H1B candidates are very welcome. We will take care of the visa process.If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu
                      
                  
      Berlin (Germany), CTO/ lead developerWe are a funded (seed) startup working on a customer analytics tool for online retailers.We are two people looking for a head of development / CTO. We have offices in Berlin, funding for one year and the package includes very generous shares for the right candidate. We use lean startup methods, and can systematically test hypotheses on any market. Hundreds of customer interviews already done. Our approach is the â€˜startup of startupsâ€™, that is, iterate fast and discard what doesnâ€™t work, even if the new product looks like a completely new application (and startup!).What we do:-----------Customer Lifefitime Value (CLV) is the mythical â€˜magic numberâ€™, the amount of money a particular customer will ever bring in. Knowing your CLV makes it trivial to:
- optimize marketing spend for different inbound channels.
- identify your highest value customers, 
- identify those in danger of never coming back.Most shops have a â€˜gut feelingâ€™ of what their CLV is, but no way of knowing for sure. Yet this is the number that would make the largest impact to their bottom line, if only it was possible to have it. Ah! Predicting the future is hard, right?It turns out CLV can be computed with surprising accuracy (10% error) at the individual level. At Fluidshopping, we use sophisticated bayesian models to estimate CLV. We look beyond what has happened in the past (which you get with say google analytics). CLV changes often, due to your marketing actions, season, or changes in the market. We retrain our models weekly to reflect those changes, and then suggest the actions that would make the largest impact (email campaigns, popups with offers triggered by user behavior on your site, etc).Requirements:-------------You can apply with any language. But we need code samples. Let us see something you build; please explain what it does and how to run it if itâ€™s not obvious. We prefer github projects. Do not send code samples that do not make sense out of context. We are looking for a difficult problem you solved, or a common problem that you solved in a novel way.You need to be within 5 years of your last academic appointment, or graduation. That is, if you graduated from university more than 5 years ago, you are not eligible. You can also apply if you had a job in research settings within the last 5 years. We do not care about you having a title, but we are funded by the government, and they do. They want to see someone with a compSci-related title. We are really sorry in advance if the requirement excludes you, a great hacker who doesnâ€™t have a title.Responsibilities:-----------------Your responsibilities will be to work on new key features, help us scale, contribute to the product and optimize performance. Youâ€™ll be the CTO in an agile development environment. Customer interviews tell us our solution attacks a very obvious pain point for online retailers, a large market that is ripe for disruption. As a CTO, you will make decisions to make sure our solution â€˜just worksâ€™ for clients. We have excellent talent for both front-end and back-end development, so you are free to concentrate on the problems that matter most (architecture, models, etc). But of course, in a small team you will need to write production-quality code yourself.Nice to have:------------Mongo or similar NoSQL db
JavaScript, Backbone.js, node if you have used it in production
python/django, ruby/rails or any other web framework
Familiarity with HTML5 (websockets)
R or any other data-friendly language with lots of libraries
Familiarity with probability theory and modelingPerks:------Work from home (optional)
Stock options in two-digit range
Dog
Terrace with barbecue
In the center of the Berlin startup ecosystem
Continuous deployment, strong testing culturecontact: jobs@fluidshopping.com
