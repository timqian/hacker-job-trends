      I think this space of email has so much upside potential. I really hope you guys can solve it. Especially in the enterprise space, with so much CC-ing, keeping everyone in the loop, etc. It's so counterproductive.I also think a great product with a good UX, can really coach better behavior in creating more productive emails. Best of luck!
                      
                  
      Thank, we think so too :)
                      
                  
      I only just learned about your product and am already hyped out to try it. 
So i just signed up, but is there GA date?
                      
                  
      A lot of companies do, otherwise have a look on Glassdoor
                      
                  
      It looks so cool! Just a bummer for potential users, I've been on the waiting list to try it since Nov '16.

      We're building on web for the desktop platforms, so it works across all systems already!iOS will be out before Android, but we will support both

We're looking for the most tenacious designers, software engineers, product managers, and more, who are committed to untangling, rewiring and redesigning critical government services. You'll join a team of the most talented technologists from across the private sector and government. No government resume required! We work on some of the biggest issues affecting the American people there are, immigration, veterans service, students, health care, and more. We're especially looking for talented senior engineers to join us to help shift move government tech in the right direction.

      I can provide 100% assurance of that. We choose projects based on "Doing the most good, for the most people, in the most need". It could be easily argued that the vast majority of our work, focuses on helping vulnerable populations. I've been here 10 Months and never had a single ethical concern. Furthermore, I firmly believe this is the kind of organization that would be fully supportive of anyone vocalizing any ethical concerns they personally had, in fact this would be encouraged.
                      
                  
      What's the interview process like?
                      
                  
      There are probably many on HN who can answer this better than me, and it of course depends on what role you are interviewing for . But IIRC, for Engineers the process involves a technical phone screen, followed by a second technical interview plus a behavioral/EQ interview. After that, your application goes before a hiring committee.
                      
                  
      Thank you for answering my question.
                      
                  
      Please excuse the aside but of all the posts here that I wish were marked REMOTE this one tops the bill. We (Americans) need this org to succeed, but DC is simply not an option for many people.
                      
                  
      You could look into Ad Hoc. They are a remote firm that builds government solutions. Worked on many popular apps.
                      
                  
      I worked in DC while living in the suburbs of Maryland. The DC metro is far from perfect, but it's really not a terrible option. The bus system is also decent.Obviously a strong remote program is even better, but very unlikely for government work.
                      
                  
      I donâ€™t think your parent comment was saying DC was bad. He/she was just saying that itâ€™s not an option for everyone to uproot and move and he/she wishes the listing was remote friendly.
                      
                  
      Lots of YC companies | Software engineers of all kinds | Everywhere, though mostly in the US | Mostly on-site, but some remote too | Full-time and internA few months ago, a team of us at Y Combinator started working on a "common app", so that people could apply to all Y Combinator companies at the same time. It seemed silly to us that even though so many companies are struggling to hire people, it still requires O(n) effort to apply to n companies.So, we built workatastartup.com. It's a simple way to apply to all YC companies at the same time. It's only for software engineers & data scientists for now (we hope to open it more broadly later). If a company is interested, you'll get an email from them.It seems to be working pretty well - many of the people who posted a profile have gotten more than a dozen company founders reaching out to them, and some people have gotten jobs through it already. We'd love if you filled out a profile and let us know what you think (workatastartup@ycombinator.com) : https://www.workatastartup.com
                      
                  
      Applied. Got zero responses though. Would be nice to show on the website, how many potential companies out there itâ€™s going to reach.
                      
                  
      When did you apply?  We have a couple of hundred companies using it now.
                      
                  
      I applied the day it was posted. My only communications from the site are a few emails from the site itself asking if I'm still looking for a job.It appears to be entirely useless if you're not in one of the hot spots so I've turned off notifications.
                      
                  
      Thanks for letting us know.  I had a look at your profile to see what the issue was.  I think in your case that the biggest issue is location.  Currently most of the roles are for people who either live in or are willing to move to one of the major tech cities.We do have some companies that are hiring for remote employees, but currently the supply/demand is imbalanced there.Sorry that it didn't work better for you.
                      
                  
      It doesn't work for me either. I had only one contact from your site. I'm in the Bay Area and response from Hired from local companies is an order of magnitude better than from Work@startup. Dunno why.
                      
                  
      Seattle is a major Tech hub with a ton of talented engineers so Iâ€™m really surprised.
                      
                  
      I've also gotten 0 responses unfortunately :(
                      
                  
      How is it different than angellist
                      
                  
      AngelList definitely has a great recruiting platform! One of the main differences right now is that Work at a Startup is a great way to get exposure to startups working on a vast array of problems in different industries. Right now we're working on making it more of a two-way marketplace where job-seekers will be able to browse all the YC companies that are currently hiring to find the ones who's goal/product really resonates with them.Stepping back a bit, hiring is the most ubiquitous problem our portfolio companies report to us in the years after going through YC. Given that, building a hiring platform for our companies that YC doesn't need to directly monetize can add a lot of value and accelerate their progress post-batch.
                      
                  
      I'm sorry I still doesn't get it, it would be helpful to provide a couple of bullet points
                      
                  
      currently, it looks more like Hired than angellist. as in you don't contact companies, they contact you,

      Tweag.io | Paris, France | REMOTE + ONSITE | Software Engineer | Formal methods, PL designhttp://tweag.ioWe are a research and development laboratory at the heart of Europe, applying functional programming techniques to tame the complexity of distributed systems and scale predictably. Most of our existing folks have a PL research and/or formal methods background and enjoy demonstrating the correctness of their solutions with gusto: randomized test case generation, model checking in SPIN/Promela or interactive theorem proving using Coq. We're very active in the Haskell community - contributing new language extenions (linear types, static pointers) to GHC, publishing and maintaining HaskellR, inline-java, sparkle, rules_haskell and many others. We hit the HN front page just yesterday with our Haskell support in Bazel.Tweag.io are organized as a distributed team of experts around three main areas of focus: distributed systems engineering, functional programming based devops (Nix, Haskell etc) and mathematical modelling / machine learning. We are looking for formal engineers and PL designers to join our distributed systems team, to help us apply interactive theorem proving techniques to industrial scale projects and work on tools to make this cost effective for the masses.If you'd love the opportunity and the space to solve the hard problems of science's large dataset infrastructure, by systematically decomposing them into simple, orthogonal solutions that compose and commute like in algebra, shoot us an email at jobs@tweag.io.

      Do you get applications from HN with that offered salary range? I've heard COL of Toronto is similar to SF; if so, this would be very low wages
                      
                  
      I've been seeing a lot of this lately with many companies near the great lakes, just awful salaries that even with a lower cost of living would be a net loss, it's a real bummer.
                      
                  
      Tell me about it. I love the Midwest (went to school there) and have considered moving to Canada but the salaries just don't come close to what I make now.
                      
                  
      The Canadian tech industry doesn't give you the same opportunity and quality of life as the American tech industry can, unfortunately. COL in Toronto is high, pay is middling, transit is limited, and the jobs are comparatively anemic. It's no wonder so many engineers leave. Canada has a lot of other things going for it, though.
                      
                  
      Right, I guess I was wondering if they realized that...
                      
                  
      I don't think they are that similar:
https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?cou...
                      
                  
      Yes, we get a very manageable amount of applicants.And we get that 70-80K doesn't get you Rosedale, but if you live in the Hammer it goes a lot further eh?
                      
                  
      If you're serious about attracting top talent, why not offer  a better wage? I'm not even talking about Bay area level salaries: the salary range that you're offering was my starting salary 5 years ago in Austin, Texas. Being in one of Canada's major cities; I would have expected a lot more.
                      
                  
      When I read "REMOTE (Toronto preferred)", I think to myself: "If I get this gig, I'm going to be the remote guy.. the unpreferred remote guy".Just sayin.
                      
                  
      Point taken, and is what I wanted to avoid.  If it puts people in a bad mood before they hit line 2 then shame on me.  Thanks for the feedback.

      In German, it's necessary to clarify in some way that job positions are open to both men and women, since most job titles are gendered. In English, Engineer and Developer, and almost all other job titles are not (waiter/waitress and actor/actress are the only exception that comes to mind). Therefore the German habit of placing "(m/w)" after advertised positions is at the least weird and very possibly off-putting when translated to English. Please don't do that: just leave it off.
                      
                  
      I find the tone of your response at the least weird and very possibly off-putting. Please don't do that: be a bit nicer.

      Note to applicants: see the very last item in bullet-list about their definition of "remote". I was told that I am not eligible because I'm 4 hours away from Louisville instead of 3 hours away.I would have assumed in the context of HN (and StackOverflow, where I first saw the listing) that "remote" means anywhere with an internet connection, not just "working from home but in our city".I did receive a relatively prompt reply though, so that was appreciated (and it was fun answering their questions).
                      
                  
      Yeah that seems odd. What's an extra hour if it's your own car with your own gas on your time? On the flipside, would have it been possible to work out an arrangement for you to move an hour or two closer? The whole thing seems like a wasted opportunity over an hour drive.
                      
                  
      This limitation is also clearly stated in the job description itself.
                      
                  
      "Remote" means to most people that the work can be done from anywhere in the world. Consider rewording it to something like "work from home possible" or similar.
                      
                  
      I never got the yay/nay (Iâ€™m assuming nay) best of luck !
                      
                  
      Please make sure you applied as instructed in the job description.  If you did, please email hrteam@level12.io with your name and the email address you applied with and I'll get back to you.
                      
                  
      That is an excellent job description page. I'm not interested in applying, but I'd love to steal^H^H^H^H^Hcopy the page for the next time I'm hiring someone!

      GitLab | Engineering and Non-Engineering Roles | Remote Only | Full-time | https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/We're currently hiring product managers, marketing roles, developers, sales reps, managers, director level positions, and more; see https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/.We're a remote only company so everyone can participate and contribute equally. GitLab Community Edition is an open-source Ruby on Rails project with over 1000 contributors.
                      
                  
      Gitlab's compensation calculator produces some uncompetitive results if you want to live in small towns :(
                      
                  
      Where did you even find it? The compensation page has a section heading for it but I couldn't find an actual calculator anywhere, just a big formula.
                      
                  
      https://about.gitlab.com/roles/engineering/developerIf you scroll down about 2/3 of the way, you'll see it.It's not competitive for me at all. I'm right beside Vancouver (Canada) where living costs are about 95% the same as Vancouver, but if I enter that, It says my salary range would be considerably less than I earn now. This seems like a really cool opportunity and I want to apply, but my family can't afford the hit (I'm the only source of income we've got and this place is crazy expensive). Kind of a bummer - it's hard to find jobs doing cool things and also earning decent money.
                      
                  
      Gitlab also will not negotiate on salary at all. I got through to the final round of interviews (round 6 of 7) and then HR let me know they'd changed how they calculated salary for my location, it dropped by $10k. I had wasted my time because at that point the salary was just too far below what I needed, even though I badly wanted to work there.
                      
                  
      I was really interested in applying recently, until I saw what their interview process entails, and laughed.  I can understand "hire slow", but 7 rounds of interviews is way too much to ask of candidates, and indicates a navel gazing culture I want no part of.
                      
                  
      Yep. Just reading that in the prior comment was off-putting.
                      
                  
      7 round of interviews for a junior dev position? Sign me on. Heck, even big 4 do not do that many rounds.
                      
                  
      I am a python/ML/Data science kind of person who likes to learn a lot. Is there anything for such a profile?
                      
                  
      GitLab is filled with people who like to learn a lot! Most of our engineering roles require Ruby, but definitely feel free to review our current vacancies to see if there are any that interest you, and remember to avoid the confidence gap :)

      If you have an EU entity, you should be able to hire anyone in the whole EU (EEA).
                      
                  
      That's sadly not the case: EU citizens can work everywhere in Europe, but employing people across Euro countries is not easy at all. You need legal advice to comply with both your country's and the employee's country's laws, some countries require an actual registered office/entity, the employee protections e.g. in Italy and France make it very hard too.This is for employment, of course. You can contract someone from anywhere, regardless of EU or not.
                      
                  
      Seems like I've been wrong then, sorry. This was the impression I got from our HR office (it is true that we require relocation).

      Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; now also Downtown LA, California)We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, Erlang (being replaced with C++) and Javascript for React, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.We are looking for engineering talent in the following roles:    * Front-end Software Engineer - React (London, LA)
    * Senior Front-end Software Engineer - React (London, LA)
    * Senior Security Engineer (London)
    * Senior Infrastructure Engineer (London)
    * Mobile Developer - React Native (London)
    * Senior Mobile Developer (LA)
    * Senior Backend Engineer, Erlang/C++/Python (London)
    * Software Engineer (London, LA)

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers/ .
                      
                  
      > Erlang (being replaced with C++)Interesting. Any back-story about this? Also, what libraries do you use as processes (and OTP) alternative (if any)?
                      
                  
      I'll provide the short version, and will encourage the exchange team to do a proper write-up once they feel ready for it. But to provide proper context, keep in mind that everything below is considered with a trading exchange in mind.Distilled down to bullet point material, the change is driven by:- language ecosystem; support libraries for Erlang are, regrettably, not that well maintained- familiarity; the team maintaining and improving the exchange stack are not Erlang experts but know C++ pretty well- hiring pool; finding good engineers who know Erlang is impressively hard. Intersection with engineers who have been exposed to financial exchanges is ... well.- performance; as I've been explained to, the underlying data structures in Erlang are designed for maximum concurrency and share-nothing model (the Actor pattern in its pure form). These impose constraints that happen to hit the hot paths pretty hard. And related to that...- memory model properties; exchanges rely on data structures whose critical paths cannot avoid invasive operations. Routinely working around your runtime's central assumptions is not exactly a best practice, regardless of the language used.I will let our exchange team tell the complete back story, in their own style and with their view from the trenches. Known interest probably helps.
                      
                  
      Thanks! It seems Erlang was not a best choice in the first place, for your project. Yes, please share the complete story when it's written.
                      
                  
      curious too

We're a remote, all engineering team, building both the front-end application, as well as the various integrations we support.We don't set you yearly goals, review your performance against some arbitary scale every 6 months, or even set deadlines. Work is ready when it's implemented at production quality.We're looking for an experienced software engineer (read as 10+ years commercial experience) and recent experience working on complex JavaScript applications. Proven ability to work remotely a plus.You will need to demonstrate high attention to detail. You'll be left alone to manage yourself, in return you need to deliver to the necessary quality level without being heavily managed.We're very fussy, but if you are self-motivated, have the skills and you're bored of the politics that many companies bring, you can own and develop complex systems from start to end without them being cancelled.Please follow the instructions at https://about.draw.io/draw-io-jobs/

      Flute Mail | Toronto | REMOTE OK (US/UK/Canada only) | Full-time | Full Stack Web Engineer | 15% equity + stipendAt Flute our team of 2 engineers has built a new kind of email API which I think will disrupt a multi-billion $ industry (think SendGrid/Mailgun/Postmark and other transactional APIs). We decouple your email API from from your servers or providers in a load-balanced, failover-native, hot-swappable fashion with full-text Elasticsearch for your data. See flutemail.comWe are very, very new: our website literally went live this week. Still havenâ€™t launched publicly, and the app is buggy (though we have a few customers on our waiting list). However, the company is profitable, due to my previous consulting contracts.My CTO is leaving to join Google in a couple months, so I need a new CTO/product-engineer to help me deploy and grow this thing.  Iâ€™m a full stack dev myself and the founder, with strong product management experience.Iâ€™m looking for someone who deeply understands the value of our core idea and is committed to joining a startup in the early stages for significant equity + a small stipend to cover living expenses. Iâ€™m a slow, methodical, code-reviewing engineer who loves to create issues and design UI/UX mockups, while youâ€™re the hackathon-move-fast-and-break-things engineer who enjoys crashing through a list of issues, and is excited to learn anything. Be prepared to do everything from DevOps to frontend hotfixes. I prefer that you have real big-company experience (since I donâ€™t).Stack: NodeJS, Angular 4, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Python integration testingHow to apply: Send me an email (see HN profile) and tell me why you think you might be a fit for this role.

      Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | OnsiteAcademia.edu is addressing two problems:- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paperâ€™s claims and findings are.It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisisâ€�. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsite
Right now the market for educational software is a mess. Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing. Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. Weâ€™ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform. Our goals are much bigger than that, though. We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of about 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React. More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs !

We find groups of startups with similar technical security challenges, and then automate and systematize.

      Kentik | Software Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite/Remote | Full-Time | kentik.comKentik is a database company masquerading as a network BI tool: https://www.kentik.com/inside-the-kentik-data-engine-part-1. We wrote a custom database in go, which at its heart works by taking a time range, storing all events by time-slice and then at query time querying each time segment in parallel. This is hidden behind a Postgres front end using the foreign data wrapper interface PG provides. Then we tried to sell this product and quickly realized that we need a data-visualization layer.We're hiring someone primarily to work on our network anomaly detection product -- https://www.kentik.com/ddos-detection/. This would be kinda a split role, working in a React framework on the client side, node, and then a go codebase which processes traffic data, checks if there's anything to alert on, and then if so does some set of actions.https://www.kentik.com/careers if you are interested.
