      Do you consider non-US citizens?
                      
                  
      If you are a non-citizen national of the U.S. or have been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and hold a valid green card then you can work at 18F.
                      
                  
      Bummer.Looks like there aren't too many software engineering positions open. Would be an amazing fit for this veteran.
                      
                  
      18F is awesome. If anyone has questions, Im happy to answer at rememberlenny at gmail.
                      
                  
      If the teams are distributed do you get your choice of geographic location?
                      
                  
      You can work from wherever you are, and you can change locations while working for 18F. But we don't provide money for relocation.Another note that the federal pay scale is determined in part by your location. More details here https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries...
                      
                  
      For example, the absolute maximum they pay anyone in SF is 160k.What "grade" would candidates for "Software Developer" have? What determines the "step" ?
                      
                  
      As I recall, they tend to start the senior folks at grade 15.  They have to get approval for starting at any step above step 1, and I don't know how often that approval is granted.They are very open about all this during the process.
                      
                  
      That's right. There's no set grade or step for engineers, but most of our senior engineers start at a 15. Your grade and step (and therefore your pay) are determined by previous experience and previous pay.
                      
                  
      that sounds bad, different location different pay
                      
                  
      But note that they can make exceptions to the pay scale (at least, move you around under the overall cap).
                      
                  
      When you change locations, your pay rate is also changed, correct?
                      
                  
      Correct.
                      
                  
      What's the working level grade for engineers?
                      
                  
      There isn't a set grade level for engineers, but most of our staff starts at a GS 14 or 15.
                      
                  
      What about for entry-level candidates?
                      
                  
      What should a junior-level Dev out of DC make? Say they currently make 80k. Solid OOP, modern web framework usage, solid JS. Pay raise/cut/stay the same?
                      
                  
      If you stop calling yourself a junior developer you will be making 130k in DC.
                      
                  
      This depends on a lot of things. 18f is government so expect lower. Feel free to email me if its a bridge you end up crossing (I'm a lifetime DC native)
                      
                  
      I love how transparent/well documented 18f is with the hiring process. The golden standard from an applicants perspective.

      All web positions. I hope this doesn't imply that the government avoids native mobile!
                      
                  
      I hope they do avoid native mobile!The government should be making services that work with every kind of device, out of the box.Given the kind of services the government is likely to build, a website is way, way more cost effective. And Googleable!Plus, accessibility requirements mandate services that can be read by the blind, hearing impaired, etc, all of which is possible with the web and much harder with native mobile.

      wow, this is pretty great.  How old is this project? Is it open source?
                      
                  
      thanks.The project was crated summer last year. As an idea to put Who is hiring thread on a map.The codebase is not opensource, although it might at some point, haven't made that decision yet.

      Y Combinator is hiring hackers (San Francisco, ONSITE)We have a small team that makes the software that runs YC. Hardly any investors write software, but YC was started by hackers so it's natural for us to solve our problems that way.The YC software is used by a relatively small number of peopleâ€”mostly the YC partners and foundersâ€”but the users are sufficiently important that through them we are able to have huge leverage. YC has ambitious plans to create more innovation in the world, and the only way to reach that level of impact is to scale through software.We're looking for a couple of great hackers to join us. It's not a job for everyone, but it could be a good fit for someone who likes startups.  If you're a hacker, have a look at the job description: https://jobs.lever.co/ycombinator/8703c1d9-af67-4826-90e4-74....

      Compose (IBM) | REMOTE (US, UK, CA)Developing software appeals to those who love to solve puzzles and apply their brain power -- and also to those, in our experience, who like working from home in their pyjamas. If you're looking to join a forward-thinking industry with a stable outlook (databases-as-a-service), we have a tremendous challenge for you and a terrific team willing and able to support you through it.Here are a few things that's great about our team:* Work from anywhere!

      great hiring process and response from the team, even though I didn't get the job I enjoyed my application process
                      
                  
      You can _work_ from anywhere, but we can only employ people who are legally able to work in the US, Canada and the UK. We don't like this restriction, but it's a side effect of being part of a very large organization with processes for hiring in every country already in effect.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the clarification. Big companies are usually able to hire contractors - i.e. not a regular employee within some country, but just an independent service provider. Companies just pay invoices. No [health] insurance, no [paid] vacations, no work-permit sponsorship needed, etc... It would be great if this is possible for Compose "department" as well.
                      
                  
      Trust me, we haven't missed an easy workaround for this. Big companies also have processes for getting contractors in place, and in many cases it's harder than hiring someone on full time.
                      
                  
      So what if I were, say, a US citizen living abroad? I am legally able to work in the US and in my home country, but of course since I'm not actually living in the US some companies might find that problematic. Do you?
                      
                  
      > What's wrong with working from mainland Europe assuming one can work within UK hours?People from mainland Europe (EU) are legally able to work in UK.
                      
                  
      They are but it's rather difficult to get national insurance number and open a bank account if you don't live there (and have proof for it, of course).
                      
                  
      I mean, I could be a UK citizen working from a beach in Thailand but I'd still be a UK citizen...

      Katasi - Boulder, CO - Full time - ONSITEKatasi is hiring a senior software developer in Boulder, CO.The company's goal is to stop distracted driving via software that knows when your phone is in the car and disables texting and data.We're building a high performance back end system (Java8, Camel, RabbitMQ, Mongo, Node) and corresponding mobile applications (Android, iOS).Small team, interesting problem.  Feel free to review the job posting below or add comments/send me an email with questions.http://katasi.com/company/#link-jobs
                      
                  
      I'm not sure if you're trolling me, but looking through your other comments seems like you are a serious commenter :), so I'll treat your query as bona fide.The main problems are:
* transmission of data in a reliable fashion (both from the phone and the module which plugs into your car) to the decision system
* making decisions quickly and accurately based on incomplete data (due to dead zones, time shifts, etc)
* displaying decisions (building a UI both for the end user and for administration)
* integrating with telcos (since it is a carrier level solution)Now, this problem isn't the same level of difficulty as say, "scaling AWS" or "inventing Google Maps", but I've found it to be an interesting problem.  It certainly is more than a phone only solution, which you imply.That said, maybe I'm missing something obvious that would make the solution simple--I'd be happy talk to the hiring manager about paying you for an hour of your time to chat about your proposed solution if you'd be interested.  My contact info is in my profile, so feel free to ping me with your rate and availability.Finally, more on the solution being built here: http://katasi.com/distracted-driving-solution-products/

      Thanks for the algorithm.  But...How do you know they aren't on the bus?  Or a passenger in a car?  What if they have GPS turned off?
                      
                  
      There is no way to know whether someone is driver or passenger without them volunteering that info. If they are willing to tap a button that says they are driving they could just easily press a button that disables talk/text.

   - Open Document filename (if any)
   - Active URL if Edge, IE, Chrome, or Firefox browsers

I'm primarily a backend developer, but have recently picked up enough C#/.NET to be dangerous, I'm just having trouble fully wrapping my head around the UI Automation framework. I think it'll be more effective to have someone with experience do this and let me focus on other pieces.This won't be for malware/scammy stuff, it's user-voluntary to collect some context for a time tracking app similar to RescueTime.I'm near Charlotte, NC, so someone I can meet in person would be preferred, but remote is perfectly fine. If you're actually reading this, include the word "DrPepper" in your email otherwise I'll just delete it - I got too much spam last time and very few actual code samples. This particular project is small but there is plenty more available for the right person.Email a link to your github profile or a short C# .NET code sample to jobs at stridatum.com.

Over the past couple of years, we've worked hard to migrate our entire web application stack to Node and powerful client-side apps and we're looking to turn the dial towards product experimentation and innovation. We need your engineering ability and your desire to be a part of the whole product!I personally lead the Online Checkout (exactly what it sounds like, "Pay with PayPal") engineering team and I'm happy to talk with you directly. You can reach out to me at my HN username at paypal.com or nodejs@paypal.com.We're looking for experienced JavaScript developers. My team is currently working primarily with Angular on the client and Kraken on Node. If you've got experience with React, we're actively exploring doing an inside-out migration of our application and could use your expertise. As most Node shops go, we're leveraging a whole lot of other open source tools as well and we're very supportive of open source activities for our people.We have several openings within my team as well as within other teams--so drop me a line even if my particular opening doesn't sound interesting and I'll help you find the right place!
