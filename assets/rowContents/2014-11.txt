Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard - Cambridge, MA - Full timeMy group within the Broad, Computational Innovation Lab is hiring a coder to develop a new software/pipeline for genome assembly, annotation and analysis. The tech stack will be a mix of Python, Scala and various JS MVC framework. What's special about the position, IMHO is that our team has a direct working relationship with scientists in the lab (no biz-analysts in between), specifically supporting one lab where the mission is to develop novel genome sequencing techniques (e.g., pac-bio, nanopore sequencing) and another lab whose purpose is to sequence and analyze genomes of infectious disease pathogens (e.g., tuberculosis). So think no morning standup's, "tyranny of agile" but more an ad-hoc academic environment where you'll communicate & work with biologists, have an opportunity to learn both the wet-lab and in silico process of genome sequencing/assembly/annotation, go to all the talks and workshops for different research groups, have ownership over the architecting, coding and dev-ops.So if you're interested in writing software without the management overhead of a traditional software org, be involved in Bioinformatics research, it might be a good opportunity for you to consider.Organization-wise, the Broad is not a tech startup, but a genomics research institute that's half-way between industry and academia; computational biology is a big deal here and background of a lot the scientist-users.https://www2.apply2jobs.com/BroadInstitute/ProfExt/index.cfm...
                      
                  
      Has anyone had success with this lately? I once posted a description of the company I work for, stating interested users should apply online. I also offered to answer any questions people had via email, which was a mistake. I probably got a dozen resumes from users unable to follow simple directions, mostly from kids in India that were going to finish school in 1-2 years. I also got spam from a few firms looking to fill our positions.
                      
                  
      As an applicant, I landed an interview with Khan Academy and some other companies from these ads.Although, the Khan Academy process involved many hours of mid-day Skype interviews, phone calls, and a relatively time-consuming take-home assignment followed by a curt thanks-but-no-thanks form letter and an encouragement that I volunteer for them. So ultimately not a success.To be fair to Khan Academy, they seem to be part of a bigger trend towards increasingly time-consuming interview processes that span weeks or months. Start-up companies are in the enviable position of asking for higher investment from applicants, while not offering a higher return (perhaps the idea is that the possibility of landing the job should be its own reward -- but wouldn't this be mutually beneficial for both the applicant and the company?).Or perhaps this is the logical extension of a community built on the idea of work-hard-first and (possibly-)get-compensated-later, or "long-term compensation" [0].Not to say any of this is necessarily wrong or bad. Supply and demand will dictate what the job market can bear, and if a company is receiving a glut of talented applicants, it's their job to thin the herd the best way they know how.[0] http://blog.samaltman.com/why-silicon-valley-works
                      
                  
      Honestly, I doubt anyone who posts a generic jobs@ or online resume black holes will have any more success than any other recruitment platform. It's a real shame, because the density of smart people on HN is much greater.The key is probably knowing your audience. Personally, I gave up after I shot a few e-mails to jobs@ from here and never got a response. I imagine better hackers simply don't have the patience.

Job Title: Application Security ConsultantHave you ever seen the 1992 film Sneakers?  Near the start, we see Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) close out a bank account, and take the proceeds to the managers.  He pretty tersely says something like:"Gentlemen, your communication lines are vulnerable. 
	Fire exits need to be monitored. 
	Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained. 
	Outside of that, everything seems to be fine. 
	You'll get our full report in a few days. But first, who's got my check?""Cut to a bank secretary, writing Martin a check."So, people hire you to break into their places...
              ...to make sure no one can break into their places?"Whenever I'm asked to explain what we do at Matasano, this scene comes to mind.  Our work is the digital equivalent; breaking applications so they can be made stronger and more resilient to attack, inoculating the world's software like a binary flu shot.Modern applications are a lot like the bank in the movie.  Authentication protects the front door, much like the bank's cameras and guards.  Encryption often protects sensitive data, similar to how steel lined walls protect a bank vault.  Communication protocols convey information in and out, like armored cars ferrying cash to and fro.  Finding the application's 'communication lines', 'fire exits', and 'rent-a-cops' is our goal.  As Application Security Consultants we seek the overlooked, the neglected, the unexpected flaws in an application's code.  Like Martin, we show how these weaknesses can lead to overall failure of the application, and we do this so it can be improved.Later in the movie, Cosmo (Ben Kingsley), a villainous ex-con says:
	"The world isn't run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It's run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It's all just electrons."
In 1992, that might've been hyperbolic but it's becoming more true every day.If being part of ensuring the systems we all rely on continue to function safely and reliably, we should talk.  If working with smart people on the cutting edge of technology excites you, we should talk.  If diving deeply into a wide variety of technologies and facing new challenges daily appeals to you, we should talk.  If tearing apart application code and making it do things that its creators didn't intend is fun for you, we should talk.You can get a taste for the sorts of things we do at www.microcorruption.com and www.cryptopals.com.Reach out to us at careers@matasano.com or by visiting our web site.

      I was in talks with Rusty about scheduling an interview, but unfortunately would only hear from him about once a week and then he stopped emailing back. I think this is something that needs to change, because he would ask for interviews within 3 hours of the email and then repeat the next week. This is a company I really want to work for, but it's impossible to talk to anyone.

We have a few open positions in the SW team:- I manage the preprocessor group here and we're looking to add a developer to help implement the next generation preprocessor (C++ development of a GUI product with 3D graphics using Qt on Windows & Linux). The job description lists a senior role with 5-7 years experience required, but I'd definitely be open to considering a more junior candidate:http://exa.com/senior-software-engineer---graphical-preproce...- Another manager here is putting together a team to build a new product to serve as a single high-level entry point that will help users manage the workflow involved with our various engineering software products. At the moment, I believe he's looking at more senior candidates who would be able to play a key role in architecture decisions and help to build the team moving forward.http://exa.com/senior-sotware-engineerssoftware-engineers---...We have other software positions listed on our website but these are the two that we're recruiting aggressively at the moment.
                      
                  
      Regarding H1B - are you sponsoring new ones, which probably means waiting for some months/year before first working day? (Not sure how is it going now with quotas...)Also, how does the public data about H1B salaries at Exa correspond to present reality? (those numbers are quite low I mean, especially for someone to consider a relocation).
                      
                  
      Are you considering remote consultants for these positions?
                      
                  
      No, I'm afraid not -- sorry.
                      
                  
      As a data point; I interviewed with these folks a while back and I was impressed with how nice everyone I spoke to was.

      Placemeter, New York City - http://www.placemeter.comWe are looking for Full-Stack Engineers (Python/Django) and Computer Vision Engineers (C++).At Placemeter we use computer vision at a massive scale, on a large number of video feeds, to understand what is going in in the physical world in real time. We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.At the core we are a bunch of PhDs developing proprietary computer vision algorithms. Come join us if you're tired of product-driven social media and advertising startups and instead want to work in a truly technology-driven environment.Full-Stack Engineers (https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter/0c7862ed-9a83-4c50-ba16-74b...): Build web apps, services and APIs on a Python/Django/MySQL/Cassandra stack. We have hard challenges both in the frontend (think data visualization) and in the backend (we are generating a LOT of data).Computer Vision Engineers (https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter/70be8dcf-e48e-4b9f-8c81-a06...): Develop the next generation of our real-time video processing algorithms which work at a scale that you'll encounter in few other places.

      Transcriptic: Full-stack developer (emphasis on frontend)Menlo Park, CA; https://www.transcriptic.com/Transcriptic is "Amazon Web Services" for the life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, CoffeeScript, and React today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.We're a rapidly growing startup (you'd be #19), well funded ($6M: Google Ventures, IA Ventures, Data Collective, AME Cloud, Founders Fund) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.Recent coverage:- http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcript...- http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4...team at transcriptic.com
                      
                  
      The service being offered at this company looks pretty interesting. The quick start example looks very reasonable (I didn't sign up to run, but I guess it must all work out). I was kind of confused though about finding and/or registering reagents and cell strains. How do you do this? It would be nice if there were another quick start example that completes some kind of standard growth assay for a verified bacterial strain (does Transcriptic have a strain library?) in one or two different media types. As a potential customer this is the sort of proof of concept example that I would want to see before pursuing anything further.
                      
                  
      We do not have a strain library that's generally available across customers. That's organization-specific IP. Strains (which we'd call a type of "resource") are usually sent in by the customer, created from scratch (eg buy TOP10 cells and transform), or bought from a commercial vendor through us.  Send us an email and we'd be happy to talk more!  team@transcriptic will go to me and a few other people who can answer these questions.

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software. We're hiring for full time positions as software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - We aren't limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I've worked with Python, Objective-C
    (and Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and
    of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software developer on this awesome team. If you're interested, get in touch with me:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

Why is that interesting? Turns out the corporate bond market is a 10 Trillion dollar market that still works like it did in 1978, with traders calling each other up on the phone. Modernization that happened in equities never made it to the bond market. All the biggest players are calling for new solutions (http://bit.ly/1tLXFZq) and that's exactly what we're building. The incumbents in this space are big, slow moving, enterprises with six to twelve month release cycles and a fear of Open Source software. We push out updates and new features within days and are releasing our own tools back to the community.Want to solve amazingly exciting problems with a small team of very experienced engineers?

      > Our long term goal is to build machines that exceed human intelligence.I remember reading back in 2012 (or was it 2011?) that you projected to have a human-level vision system by 2015 and a strong AI by 2018. How far along are you?I think it would be much easier for you to recruit world-class ML/AI people if there was a public window into what you are doing and what results you are getting. Similar to the very impressive papers that DeepMind has been releasing.A single paper showing impressive research would do much more for your ability to recruit top talent than grand mission statements and PR hype.
                      
                  
      Don't take it in a wrong way, but I checked your web page, and while it looks very impressive, I have no idea how you guys are making money. Would it be OK for you to explain a bit?
                      
                  
      Look, I want to kill all humans and grind civilization beneath my hoard of paperclips as much as the next computer scientist, but you've got to actually publish research results or the only people you'll keep fooling are venture capitalists.

Whereas other analytics tools require you to define events upfront, Heap lets you run instant, retroactive analytics without writing code.=== The Role ===Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack. We're eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day.Weâ€™d like to get to know you if:* You enjoy teaching yourself whatever is necessary to build something.* You plow through obstacles.* Youâ€™ve written 10,000 lines of code that look really embarrassing in retrospect.* Youâ€™ve written 10,000 lines of good code since then.* You communicate ideas with clarity and precision.* You make decisions with a preference for empiricism and measurement.* You like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes.Our stack is Node + Redis + Postgres + Backbone + D3. Some things we're working on:* Data capture. Weâ€™re integrating with more clients and frameworks, including Android, AngularJS, and Backbone.js, all with virtually no performance overhead or integration cost.* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice the data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data.* Data visualization. Simple pre-generated graphs just don't cut it. There's an enormous number of ways to organize the data. Existing tools only scratch the surface.Heap was in Y Combinatorâ€™s W13 batch. Soon after, we raised a $2M seed round from Ron Conway, Ram Shriram, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, and others.We work in SF but are absolutely open to remote engineers.

      Rentify | London | Visa possibleRentify is always hiring talented software engineers to join our team.We're c. 50 people based across two sites in the UK, and we believe that estate agents don't have a right to exist in 2014. We also believe fees should be lower for landlords and tenants alike, and that technology should improve the lives of everyone in the rental sector.So far we've transacted with over 160,000 landlords and just over a million tenants.We are a Rails shop and we believe in TDD + the best solution winning the day, rather than the loudest voice. We favour engineers who focus on shipping and who have a track record of simplifying, cutting corners, and knowing when it's a good thing to accrue some technical debt.Our office in London is right next door to Barbican tube station. It's dual facing so there's lots of natural sunlight, and we have a bar, soft drinks and snacks, a bunch of breakout spaces, video games, and all that sort of thing. We pay market + stock options, and have a strong culture, which I'd broadly characterise as hard-working, fun, and informal.We're recruiting for all experience levels: some combination of Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript is required, but mainly we want a strong work ethic and a winning personality. We're especially keen to hear from women who are in the junior - midweight bracket.If you've had a bad experience using an estate agent, then come and help us create a future without them. Email me on george@rentify.com or our CTO, David, on david@rentify.com.

      Blend Labs | https://blendlabs.com/ | San Francisco | Software EngineerThe last 10 years saw a massive boom in the US real estate market fueled by troubled loans buyers couldnâ€™t afford. An even larger, chaotic bust followed, with losses of $2.8 trillion, along with the homes of more than 14 million Americans. While the economy has since improved, many processes within the mortgage industry have not. Gains have been made primarily in paperwork and manpower, not technology. Operations remain manual and slow and consumers are not happy.At Blend, we're fixing these problems by replacing the archaic software and manual processes currently used for home lending.  We're applying modern data analysis tools and consumer-grade UI/UX to streamline home lending for both borrowers and banks and make the entire process more transparent.Our team of 20 includes engineers formerly at Palantir, Google, Stanford, CMU, and Caltech. We're backed by Peter Thiel, Formation 8, Andreessen Horowitz, Max Levchin, Lightspeed Ventures, and other prominent investors. Our stack includes NodeJS, Spark, AngularJS, ElasticSearch, and Golang.https://blendlabs.com/jobs/

      Tableau Software - Palo Alto and Seattle
Helping people see and understand their data.Tableau Software is growing like crazy and looking for talent: front end, back end, mobile; developers and managers.  If you can name a software challenge, we are addressing it to solve our customers' problems.We are the fastest growing BI software company, and headed to being the fastest growing enterprise software company...but we're really doing that by being an any-knowledge-worker software company in disguise. Better yet, we are an open, collaborative, fast-growing software company with a data visualization product people describe using the words "fast, easy, beautiful."This is a great company.  I started there earlier this year.  The development team is top notch, the sales team knows how to treat customers, and HR knows how to take care of us.http://careers.tableausoftware.com/BTW, if you're near Palo Alto, we've having a happy hour next week (5-Nov-2014, see the invitation at https://tableaudevhh.eventbrite.com).

      Sorry to hear about this, please feel free to contact me directly.If you have ever contacted Tableau regarding employment and didn't hear back, please let me know (even if you are no longer interested in us).  We are growing fast but that's no excuse.  I'm a developer, not a recruiter, but I will take personal responsibility to follow through on issues like this.The best way to apply for a job at Tableau is via the careers web page (mentioned above), rather than calling or emailing.  If you want to make a connection with someone inside the company, you can mail me (the email address in my profile is "spam-protected" but it should get through).

We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers.

Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 / Backbone.js / Django / Python / Postgres / Heroku / Ubuntu, but we're a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.We're also hiring for a "Special Operations Associate" which is someone who may not have unique technical ability, but who has great aptitude and a willingness to work hard to improve our business.  Analytical capability and attention to detail are important skills for this person.  Bonus points for someone with an Industrial Engineering or Process Engineering background.

      Smarkets, London, UK. Sorry, no remote.We're always looking for generalist, python-happy software engineers. If you know, or want to learn erlang, even better.Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We're a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over Â£600 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too high, spelling for opportunity to do better.We're building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

      Centervue - http://www.centervue.com - Padova, ItalyWe're looking for* A Rails backend person.  Postgres, Rails 3.1.  Knowledge of AWS is a big plus.* An Android person, with deep knowledge of Android, including the whole OS (Cyanogen mod).  Some design skills along with this would be nice.Other stuff that's nice: Erlang, C++ (Qt).It's a good company, doing something that helps people in the real world.  The wages are good by Italian standards (at least 1600 net, and willing to discuss working with a Partita IVA), but Italian wages are in general not that high .Pure remote work is probably not something that would work well, since you need to be able to interact with the machines we work on.  Some remote work might be ok if you're able to come in often.Contact: davidw@dedasys.com
                      
                  
      Let's see:* It's not mine to decide - I work there, and don't decide who gets what.* The cost of living is lower than in other places, and the economy is pretty bad, so locally, at least, they pay pretty well and have less competition.* Jobs are not global: pay in Des Moines Iowa is probably different from that in San Francisco.  A company in San Francisco cannot easily hire Europeans due to the US' terrible immigration bureaucracy, whereas anyone from Helsinki to Lisbon can come work in Italy without too much hassle.* I don't know too much about the financial side of the company, but operating in Italy is not exactly easy on a business: http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings* Once again, I'm not privy to the financial details, but being involved with technology that helps people with vision problems does not carry the same kind of valuation that something really beneficial to the world like Instagram or WhatsApp does.
                      
                  
      Just to clarify, when I say US-level salary - I do NOT mean Bay Area/SF - which is an extreme, yes...But since you mentioned - I doubt you'll find an experienced software engineer in Iowa working for 2K USD per month... AFAIK living costs in Iowa is much much lower than in any place in Italy.
                      
                  
      Cost of living.
                      
                  
      What makes you say so?http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_resul...Italy is one of those high-prices low-wages places which is not uncommon in southern Europe.
