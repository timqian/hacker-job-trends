Hey, a friendly reminder. I'm parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map onhttps://whoishiring.ioPlease read the below if you are planning to post here and would like to have your offer looking good on the map.I've been doing this since August last year, both parsing the thread and adding this comment here. But this time I would like to only slightly improve one thing: the format.First, I would like to say that I really like that this thread is one of the few places where hard format for jobs isn't required. The format change that I'm asking for is minimal and a lot of people already post their posts in similar or exactly the same format.What Iâ€™d like to ask is for the format of the first line to be like this:  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, company url}
  Google | Software Developer | SF | VISA https://google.com
  DuckDuckGo | Software Developer | Paoli PA | REMOTE, VISA
or  2) {company} | {job title} | {locations}
  Google | Site Reliability Engineer | London, Zurich, Sydney
  Facebook | Web-developer | London, Zurich

I will be using this regex to test the firstline.  \s*(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s*(?:\|\s*(?P<attrs>.+))?$

You can test it in Python or here https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/3 (for match look right). What if you do not comply? Absolutely nothing. I will continue to do my best to parse your job post as it is.To HN moderators. Apologies for highjacking the thread. I'm getting really positive feedback about what I'm doing here. I just want to improve this one thing.Feedback welcome.
                      
                  
      Thanks for your work!Gonna jump on this meta thread to say I just finished upvoting every submission with a salary range, and encourage everyone to do the same.(Searching for $1 was enough to find most of them.)
                      
                  
      But then you won't find the high paying ones starting with $2!
                      
                  
      You're not allowed to do jokes on HN.  You have to save those for Reddit.
                      
                  
      Seconded :). Also upvoted every post I found that shown a salary range. Let's make it more appealing for announcers to disclose the offered salary. Please upvote the posts where a salary or salary range is advertised.
                      
                  
      That's a wonderful site/service.  I find the UI very clean and attractive but of course that's subjective.  I really enjoy map-based data visualizations.  It's particularly interesting to me to pick out the middle-of-nowhere companies and try to imagine why they were founded where they were, given the hiring, logistics and (I would imagine) the funding hurdles that would have resulted from the decision. In my experience talking to a few such founders, it's often a matter of "dammit, I love it here, this is where I'm going to start my business, and let the chips fall where they may" ... an attitude I find admirable.Who'd have thought there'd be so many gigs in Remote, Oregon? :)https://whoishiring.io/search/43.022/-123.921/10/http://tinyurl.com/zn8hoev
                      
                  
      Thanks for putting this together!I was surprised by the number of jobs near where I live - until I realized they were all in the town of Remote, OR. Sorry that my state abbreviation is also a word.
                      
                  
      Xando, I propose adding a SALARY keyword if the post includes salary, just in case the amount is in Euro or whatever.
                      
                  
      I'm not handling a salary right now. But it looks like I should. I will try to do something about it.Just a note. To have the search enabled on a salary, values have to be normalised to something, dollars sound good to me.As for the keyword. This is something probably HN crew could decide on. In my opinion isn't needed as long salary is in first row with $xxx or $xxx-$xxx format. But since many people seems to be interested here. Maybe would be good idea to mention something about salary in the thread description.
                      
                  
      perhaps call it 'compensation'?  It could be in a variety of forms, either $/yr, $/hr, per-project, etc.
                      
                  
      What would we do with multiple job offerings? It gets pretty unreadable quickly if we have more than one or two jobs on offer, if we follow that spec.
What if we added a regex test against the post body?
                      
                  
      True. But the HN comments have char limits as well. The post can't be too long and eventually you will have to split it anyway.The other option is just to add something that some people here do already "Multiple positions" / "Many positions".
                      
                  
      > It gets pretty unreadable quickly 
Yep. That and the Regex also breaks down very quickly / easily. I tested 5 jobs listed in this thread after OP's post with Regex. Only 1 got it right (20% success rate)Here's the one from the Binti job listing in this thread. The regex determined that title` is `San Francisco, CA` and the `locations`	 is `Software Engineer`https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/4
                      
                  
      Feature requests:- On back-nav, grab the query from the URL.- Use window.location.replace() until the text box loses focus, or the list is scrolled, or for a bit of time, or something to indicate that the user has finished typing out a query, and then use window.location.assign()?Navigating back immediately replaces the query in the url with what's in the textbox making back useless, and the history has a ton of entries (one for each character typed).  Without those changes, navigating back is a painful experience, but with them it should be significantly easier.
                      
                  
      Yes, the broken back behaviour is the really serious negative with this map.  I had to abandon my browser tab to go back to hacker news to complain about this!  Please fix it! :)
                      
                  
      Thanks for the report. I will create a todo item for this.
                      
                  
      Wow, didnâ€™t expect that my comment will have this amount of attention. Thanks for the comments here and all the emails.As for the format. Many people actually used used the format. 182 posts matched the format. As a result those post are displayed on https://whoishiring.io with correct company name, location and thanks to ClearBit Logo API even logos. As for the rest I was doing my best to get them in the proper form as well.
                      
                  
      Seems not to work on my iPad. I hit enter after filling the location field and the page just reloads. Also, e second input field shows something like {{placeholder}}.
                      
                  
      > Also, e second input field shows something like {{placeholder}}Yep. That's angular.js
                      
                  
      Love the site. One thing I'd love is the ability to filter out 3rd party recruiters like Toptal.
                      
                  
      My feedback is: Great Job!  Site looks amazing! Really wish more career sites had this kind of layout.
                      
                  
      Very cool! I should've used a better call to action as <myhackernewsusername> @reddit.com doesn't really make sense when you can't see my username.
                      
                  
      Not a big deal (as there aren't many listings for Birmingham, AL) but it looks like many are UK rather than US based.
                      
                  
      Thanks. It geo-services fault, I gives priority for US locations before anything else. A "fun" fact it happens for Richmond and Melbourne as well.Said that, I will do my best to do something about it.
                      
                  
      Where's the source code? :)
Is Hacker News the only source of the offers?
                      
                  
      From the site's <META> tag, it looks like they are scraping ( i.e. "aggregating") other sites also.> <meta name="description" content="The map with the collection of jobs for Software Engineers, Software developers, Programmers, Designers and remote.

      Yammer (Microsoft) | Software Engineer | San Francisco, Seattle | VISA https://careers.microsoft.com/yammerHiring all roles (mobile, front end, java services, infrastructure) in San Francisco and Seattle.Yammer's mission has always been to connect people with information to enable better, faster decisions. We believe effective communication involves more than chat rooms (though we use those too!). A big part of the mission I enjoy is that we are sparking cultural changes in our customers; to become transparent workplaces, with fewer silos and greater connections across the org chart from left to right and bottom to top.Since winning TechCrunch in 2008 our growth has been exponential year over year. Over the last 4 years as a part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite, we've been quietly tying our systems together with the O365 fabric while continuing to improve the experience using our tried-and-true data-driven methods. We know everything we ship has an impact, and precisely how much.We create with vim, SublimeText, IntelliJ, and GitHub; run on Macs and Ubuntu; write Swift & ObjC, Java (Dropwizard), Python, and Ruby on Rails; manage PostgreSQL, HBase, RabbitMQ, Memcache, HAProxy, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Storm, Kibana, and Vertica clusters at scale; and automate using Puppet, Docker, Mesos, Marathon and Azure across physical data center & cloud environments.We have two floors in the "Twitter building" at 10th and Market in San Francisco, where we work next to the Outlook Mobile, MileIQ, Volumetrix, and other acquired startup teams. It's a fantastic, open, creative space.If San Francisco isn't your thing, we have a large sibling team in Seattle (Redmond). We're hiring for all roles in both locations!Microsoft pays very competitively, invests in employees, and is highly supportive of a diverse and respectful workplace. It's a startup atmosphere with the stability and maturity of a large company, which makes it a perfect balance for me.If you have questions about a role I'd be happy to talk over email or in person. (I've been at Yammer for 7 years.)

      Hello! Any recommendations for highlighting the fact that we're applying from a HN Who's Hiring post? Like a keyword in the email subject line or body, etc. Thanks for your time!
                      
                  
      Doesn't really matter one way or the other. We have hired some great folks in the past who found out about us from HN. Looking forward to seeing your application. Cheers!
                      
                  
      Not with the parents' company, but I've hired and been hired through HN. I don't recommend mentioning HN at all unless it's in passing. It will not help your resume get attention and may contribute to it getting unfairly ignored.HN posts often get a large number of respondents. Stand out by bit by not mentioning it. Alone, it's not a good indicator of your quality as a candidate.
                      
                  
      Interesting, thanks for your perspective!

      I applied to CoreOS when they posted here a few months ago. Their recruiter called me and we had a nice talk. He said that he wanted to move me to the next step and meet with their technical lead. They never scheduled that phone call, and when I followed up, he wrote that things are "hectic" and then stopped answering my emails.
                      
                  
      Similar experience but I had a talk with the recruiter, technical phone interview, and then 3 hour onsite. I thought the interview went OK but they never got back after that - even when I emailed.
                      
                  
      This is one the reasons that I tend to prefer to just not talk with so-called internal recruiters, period.

      Recursion Pharmaceuticals | SLC, Utah | Onsite, full-timeRecursion is a startup with about 25 people, but we generate rich biological data at a pace comparable to the biggest institutions anywhere doing biology and disease research. â€‹We have literally millions of images from experiments we conducted in our lab, and we generate terabytes more each week. Weâ€™ve gotten more than $2M in multiple grants from the NIH, and last month closed a $13M series A led by Lux Capital. Weâ€™re using imaging experiments to turn human cell experiments into massive amounts of rich biological data so we can find treatments for many diseases as fast as possible.Hiring:* Software engineering: Full-stack Software Engineer - Front-end Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineer* Data science: Growing fast and looking for great people, but applications are offline this month while we improve hiring infrastructure.http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers for more details and to apply. Applications go to me (CTO) and our lead engineers.Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it's half an hour to 5 ski resorts. Competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor/extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we canâ€™t handle the lottery at this stage.Tech: Data science: python scientific stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, bokeh, etc). Software engineering: go, python, angular.js, react, javascript on aws and gce. Deep learning (e.g. convolutional networks) we're mainly using the python frameworks (keras, theano, tensorflow, etc).Our team of ~30: http://www.recursionpharma.com/team
                      
                  
      I applied only to be turned down for not finishing all the aspects of the "code challenge" within 2 hours.I don't think the challenge is a fair representation of the competence of prospective hires. I was really hoping to get involved with what you guys are doing. I hope that improving your "hiring infrastructure" involves a reconsideration of this filter.

      Salaries for Montreal office seem quite low (70-80K). No chance for 6-figures in Canada?
                      
                  
      NOt really. From my experience six figures needs senior/lead experience, an uncommon tech stack, and being in Toronto.If you want six figures and are a Canadian developer, you usually look to moving too or working remotely for an American company.
                      
                  
      Are you part of that team?

      4 links, and the second one is to careers page :)About skills and salary, it depends on the person. We are a small (7 right now) company. We are more concerned about having colleagues who can contribute, and who would find interest in working with us.And thats why I wanted to explain our company. Otherwise it gives an impression of just another Indian consulting sweat shop.I guess, I am not looking for agreement, just explaining. If moderators find the job post to be against guidelines of 'Ask HN: Who is hiring?', I will delete the current post, and be careful about future posts.

      Just had a look at http://altvr.com/team - that's how you feel about HR's role in a company? That's a pretty bad look.
                      
                  
      Hi, so thatâ€™s my pic, yes. Let me share context. First, frankly, I do think that is how HR (in some cases rightly so, sadly) is often seen, but I wasnâ€™t the source of the pic. The origin is, the pic was created as a joke by our head of Engineering to reflect the fact that the ceiling light above my desk never went off. I used to tease the team that it was the all-seeing Eye of Sauron. When he created that pic as a lark on a Friday afternoon, we all just found it really funny as it is so not who I am as an HR head (my half-pink hair is somewhat muted by the volcano glow around my head in the picâ€”Iâ€™m not one for false gravitas!)Yet I actually feel the responsibility of my role so deeply that it is a relief to sometimes have a good laugh at it/myselfâ€”thatâ€™s all this pic was intended to be. And laughing at oneself is something a Sauron wouldnâ€™t ever be able to do. :-)

      I had 2 phone screens with Tower and then a scheduled onsite.  2 days before the onsite was supposed to happen they cancelled and then ghosted me.The whole experience was a frustrating waste of time.
                      
                  
      I'm extremely sorry about that. This was completely unprofessional on our part. Could I request you to email me your interview and onsite dates, so I can track down exactly where we dropped the ball?
