Amsterdam, The Netherlands. H1B[1]Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, team leads,
DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a
developer there working on infrastructure tasks and relocated there
just over two years ago and have been very happy with it.We're currently looking to fill 25 developer positions (which matches
our growth curve), and are also looking for senior team leads.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and
are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the
people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with
bringing people in. All our internal communication is done in English
so there's no need to learn Dutch.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for
development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your
code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing
it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain
any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a
few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and
a few CPAN modules.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or
forward your resume, You can also apply directly at
http://booking.com/jobs if you'd prefer.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent. If you
   are not from the EU we will apply for a work & residence permit for
   you and your family if needed.
                      
                  
      Transcriptic: Core DeveloperMenlo Park, CATranscriptic is the "Amazon Web Services" for life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development. Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.We're a very small startup (you'd be #5), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.max at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/

      Factual is currently hiring engineers and data lovers of all levels in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai.Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US ('exceptional' meaning you are a great engineer and have lots of machine learning/data extraction/NLP/etc. experience that is relevant to what we do).Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.You can email me personally at leo@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:Palo Alto Software Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Software engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Data Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews

      Knewton (Union Square, NYC, full-time) is hiring for the following:-> Software Engineer-> Infrastructure Software Engineer-> Data Scientist-> Adaptive Instruction Analysthttp://www.knewton.com/jobs/=====Knewton is building the world's most powerful adaptive learning engine, with the goal of making personalized and engaging education available to all. Knewton has been recognized as a Technology Pioneer for 2011 by the World Economic Forum in Davos and one of the top 25 best places to work by Crainâ€™s New York Business.
This is an outstanding opportunity to work with and learn from the world's best engineers and data scientists.=====On a personal note: working for us means you'll get free dinner, drinks, coffee, the benefits you'd expect from a mature company (health/dental/vision, group deals on gym memberships, 401(k)), and the great perks you'd expect from a small company (our ping-pong tournament starts next week, our happy hours start every Friday at 5:01pm, and our vacation policy is limitless).We're also pretty flexible about getting work done. We all work remotely to some degree (I work from Miami every other month, and we have devs in Hawaii and Colorado), and those on our team who weren't impacted by Sandy are working at coffee shops, libraries, and apartments across the five boroughs.Feel free to ask me any questions @achompas on Twitter.
                      
                  
      "our vacation policy is limitless"I think policies like this would cause more tension and worry than they relieve. Kind of like "pick your salary". Surely different people have different expectations? Do Europeans take 5 weeks a year and Americans take 2?I've never been employed under a policy like this and I'm genuinely curious as to how well you think it's helping morale.
                      
                  
      I'm happy with it. At my last job I felt miserable negotiating paid time off past my limit:"I'd like to take a week off.""Well you only have 4 days left, and we need at least one person in the office the day before Christmas, so I could turn this down...""But I'm only short by one day!"(I end up delaying my Christmas vacation by 3 days as a result, and I resent my boss for it)---This doesn't happen at Knewton. If I need time off, and my work is done, I take it.Hurricane Sandy is actually a perfect example. I've had no power since Monday night in Soho, and today is my first full day online. An unlimited vacation policy means I don't have to take a shorter Christmas break because an act of God swept through and pwnd my neighborhood.
                      
                  
      My previous employer had such a policy (5 year old company with less than 100 employees, total, though we all worked in groups of 10-ish). While it sounded nice, if was difficult to get time off as needed. There was always trouble making sure work was done and things were covered (it was a fairly fast-paced schedule). In the end, very few people took much vacation.While I have no problem with the general premise of that policy, I would rather have had an additional stipulation that all employees are required^ to take, say, 3 weeks of vacation annually (or, pick a number). That way, it was expected you would be out of the office for a portion of time.^ I guess you can't force people to do that, but it would have made things so much less confusing or difficult to me if I could point to such a "rule."[Edit: I realize some of this problem probably rested on the shoulders of management, but that wouldn't have solved all the issues of the policy.]
                      
                  
      What Alex said. Noticeably less friction. There's no HR time tracking. No flex time. No BS.It stops you from worrying that you've eaten into your vacation time when you take a day here or there for appointments, long weekends, family events, child sickness, etc.In  fits with our general focus on productivity over seat time.
                      
                  
      It basically means an undefined vacation policy.  It's good for employers they don't have to pay out stored up PTO days and they can keep whatever real soft limit they want in their heads that they set culturally as the management.You don't want to look like your taking too much time off and be abusing the policy.It is good although that sick days tend not to count for these limits.
                      
                  
      It's good for employers they don't have to pay out stored up PTO days and they can keep whatever real soft limit they want in their heads that they set culturally as the management.It's also good for employees in that I don't have to haggle over PTO whenever I want to take a vacation.Haggling with your employer over time off is terrible. It's a poor experience--I shouldn't lose 3 days off of Christmas vacation just because my butt wasn't in my chair an additional 8 hours during the previous 11.5 months.

      San Francisco, CA. Full time. H1B okay.Sharing over social media is driving an ever-increasing percentage of web traffic. But with mobile clients and HTTPS, traditional web analytics isn't working anymore. We know we can do better, so awe.sm is building full-featured social media conversion tracking and analytics. We tell our customers the value of their social traffic in a metric that's meaningful to them, whether it's page views, signups or dollars of sales. Our APIs allow app developers to integrate social data into their products, without building their own data collection and processing infrastructure.We're an engineering-driven team building products primarily for other developers, so we're passionate about providing an amazing experience for developers. To help us get there, we're looking for a Developer Experience Lead. By that we mean somebody who will really own that experience: somebody who understands deeply how to get the most out of awe.sm, and has the communication skills to get that information to developers. That will mean representing awe.sm at hackathons and other developer events, and being the primary point of contact for developers building on our platform. We want you to find the pain points before our customers do, and feed that information back to the engineering team, so we can adapt our product to real-world needs. We also want you to do anything else you can think of that will help: building demos, writing client libraries, expanding our documentation, or working one-on-one with clients who have novel problems, to see how we can expand the platform to meet their needs.We want you to eliminate friction from integrating awe.sm with our customers' systems. You need to be an engineer first, but also a puzzle-solver, a pattern-finder, and a great communicator. There's no role more critical to our growth right now. (We are also hiring back-end and full-stack engineers.)http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernewsWe're 13 people right now. We have a cool new office with awesome views ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) in the heart of the Mission. We have catered lunches, and full health, vision and dental coverage. We use an IRC server for team communication and are agile in the sense that we move quickly and react fast, not in the sense of having attended an overpriced training course.

      We're hiring engineers to work on classification, systems, and core engineering for automated classification of online video. We use Python, linux, and make extensive use of AWS (do you like to play with MASSIVE data sets?).Our product technology is a bit different than anyone else's right now; it uses machine learning and computer vision to watch and classify internet video, frame by frame, at large scale. 
To put this in context, letâ€™s say that the average video is three minutes long and there are 50 million videos put online every month. Thatâ€™s 150 million minutes of online video published monthly. If you hired people to watch and categorize every single one of them, youâ€™d need 3,422 people working 24/7 to do what SET technology does. Whatâ€™s more, we donâ€™t just know that a given video contains sports, we know itâ€™s soccer, hockey, or basketball. And we know whether itâ€™s safe or not fit for a customer's brand."Our API provides extremely low latency responses to clients asking questions about page- and video-level. Our Dashboard provides reports generated from large amounts of raw data.lars at set dot tv

Every single person who's installed ithas gotten mad when our testflights expire.Â This is, verbatim, what one of our investors had to say after running it for a week:"Just wow. It's so magical. So easy. In fact, almost too easy. I'd insert something in the first time user experience that is whimsical and funny like: "making the magic happen..." And then boom suddenly your whole life shows up as an archive. I just can't get over this. So stunning. You've achieved what few could."We are well funded by a long list of top tier investors: http://angel.co/herelabsWe're looking for a select few product designers (technical people with a portfolio of mobile work) and mobile engineers (who know iOS inside and out and have good taste in design) who can come in and contribute at speed on day one and who are world class at more than one thing.Ideal candidates are brilliant, fearless, and passionate individuals who are uncompromising in their pursuit of building an incredible product that will positively affect the lives of every human being every day.Â As teammates we value commitment and accountability; honing our craft; building tools to create leverage; and seeking to learn from and understand each other.We are offering founding team equity and competitive salaries. Office space in the heart of the SoMa in beautiful San Francisco. $10K budget for equipment ready the day you start. Exec budgets, gym memberships, team lunches. Willing to relocate. Willing to fly you in for interviews. Willing to tell you our stealthy secrets.We are not your typical San Francisco stealth startup. We are NOT another me-too-social-local-sharing app. We DON'T sell condoms by subscription. We are NOT the place to share photos of your dog taking a leak. There will be NO gamification.Life is short. Build stuff that matters. Email siqi at herelabs.com.
                      
                  
      Just a bit of feedback: the part where you get somewhere close to describing what your company actually does[1] is very well buried. And the rest is incredibly vague and sounds very much like the stereotypical startup pitch you parody in your opening sentence. Your pitch has all the points of a stereotypical SF startup: vague platitudes about the future, a list of â€œtop investors,â€� â€œbuilding something that mattersâ€�, stealth mode, claiming you're not like all the other startups. Frankly, your whole comment is one of the best pieces of satire I've seen on this board.Not only that, but a service that archives my life sounds likeâ€¦ Facebook timeline.I realize you guys are stealth, but if you want to attract people by claiming that you're building something that matters, you might want to actually tell us what you're building.[1]:  â€�And then boom suddenly your whole life shows up as an archive. I just can't get over this. So stunning. You've achieved what few could.â€œ
                      
                  
      Well this is painful, but fair.Recruiting while trying to stay stealth is like voluntarily punching yourself in the face. We're always happy to give demos to anyone who's interested in talking to us - we're just not ready to have it all down in a public forum yet.I can understand where you're coming from and I agree, but we're going to just have to live with this until we're closer to launch.
                      
                  
      I've read this advertisement in the last 2-3 "Who's hiring" posts. I finally understand what they do after you highlighted that sentence.
                      
                  
      They have a CollegeHumor sketch (on startup stereotypes) as their introduction on AngelList. I'm confused.
                      
                  
      I'm a beta tester for the product and I USE IT EVERY DAY.I'll let @blader talk about the product specifics, but if I were to describe it in a few words -> "It just works like magic"
                      
                  
      What are companies like yours thoughts on people who don't have much "portfolio" work, but have been working on a side project that seems to at least superficially match your goals and mission?I have been working on a project (web and iOS based) with a couple of friends and we would describe ourselves similarly. We've put a lot of work into it, but that is pretty much the only public work I could show you.
                      
                  
      Let's talk! Email me at siqi@herelabs.com - happy tp show you what we're doing too.

The company is very small but generating material and predictable revenue; net revenue growth has exploded in the last quarter.We also just launched with a $5.1M Series A in the press w/ TechCrunch, AllThingsD, GigaOm and VentureBeat (press links below).Talk to us?

      Afar Media | Full Time | San FranciscoAfar Media is a collaborative travel guide as well as a printed travel magazine. I'm the lead engineer for a three-person team, and we're looking to add a front-end developer. We use Rails 3, Slim and all the attendant technologies (jQuery, CoffeeScript, drinking lots of coffee). Lately, we've been using Ember.js, which is awesome.
I'll paste below our official post, but let me say up front why I think this is a great job.
- We work reasonable hours and we're paid well for our time. (No nebulous promises of worthless equity for infinite hours at the desk.)
- We believe in travel so strongly that we pay you to do it. That is, each employee gets a yearly travel stipend and three weeks vacation to use it. The only caveat is it must be international travel and it must be to a city you've never visited before. (Note: this is an awesome caveat.)
- Live somewhere else in the US? Maybe we could work something out about working remotely transition into working in the office. (Maybe. Tell us what's up. I started working remotely from Chicago before moving to SF.)---- Begin Official Description ----
AFAR Media is a well-funded travel media start-up spanning print and web. We have big monitors, stand-up desks, and fancy new laptops. Your coworkers will be be developers, designers, project mangers, and (this is the cool part) magazine editors, meaning you'll work with a wider ranger of personalities than the standard developer scrum.
This job is ideal for someone who loves to travel for fun (the position does not require travel, but a fulfilling life does, and one of our great perks is a yearly travel stipend). No arbitrary requirements here, if you are an expert or a least have a hacking willingness to learn and have a good attitude, we want you. Our team is small, and all opinions are considered (and frankly, needed) from product design through delivery.
Check out our site: http://www.afar.com If you are interested, please send an email to jobs@afar.com, including relevant experience and work.

      London UK: Junior test automation engineer. Permanent, full-time, on-site.At YouView we are automating the testing of our product (a set-top box) using stb-tester[1], a tool that we developed and open-sourced which captures video from the set-top box and analyses it in real time.These are early days for the project, so you can have a large impact on its direction and success. One week you might be writing a python module to control a network-controllable power supply; another week it might be a script to generate comprehensive test coverage of a menu tree. There will be tedious work too, but we want the kind of person who hates tedious work so much that they automate it away.Unix shell scripting and administration experience is highly desirable.

Are you tired of commuting to DC or Northern Virginia? Swift Software is a growing product-centered technology company seeking talented developers to join our development and proserv teams in Frederick, MD. Our flagship product is JobTraQ, a task management and workflow system that offers vastly more flexibility and power than any other product in our market segment, and is significantly less expensive and easier to configure than big "BPM" suites like MetaStorm and Lombardi.

Our implementation and customization projects are usually one week to two months long, so youâ€™ll enjoy a wide range of work on interesting problems for clients in many regions and industries. Recent projects have included a touchscreen system for warehouse tracking, integration with accounting systems, complex custom finance and billing reports, and automatic data synchronization.Both teams have an enjoyable and collaborative culture in a creative environment. We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base. Our environment is relaxed and fun, we play everything from Total Annihilation to Alien Swarm at our game nights, and we equip everyone with new quad-core Thinkpads with SSDs and dual monitors.

  +   We meet up 2-3 times a year in Boston with the rest of the company.

What are we looking for in a new member of our team?  +   Excitement, energy and a willingness to learn something new.
  +   The ability to take a task from idea to code to testing to deploy (all within a short amount of time).
  +   Bring new ideas around project or processes to the team - if we like it - we'll do it.
  +   You can work from home, from our Newton, MA headquarters, or your local coffee shop.  Anywhere with Internet access.
  +   You'll be part of an on-call rotation with the rest of our team.
  +   Flexible person who can work by themselves or pair with their team to teach or learn.

What are some things you should know or have worked with before? (Some, many or all)  +   Ruby 
  +   Chef (comfortable writing cookbooks, LWRP's, etc), Fog
  +   Rails, Sinatra
  +   Git or other DVCS
  +   Strong System administration with Ubuntu (includes security, logging, monitoring, web/SQL admin, etc, etc)
  +   Contributing to open source

We were last valued at 20 million, and expect to be valued at 50 million during 2013.Technology
We use node.js for most of our backend services. We use MongoDB as our database. We create rich clients with JS/HTML, iOS and Android. We expect you to be proficient in at least one of these technologies, and to be able to learn more. We're looking for great devs over a specific skillset.For the DevOps position, we're looking for someone who can focus on scaling, removing deploy friction, uptime and security, but we want someone who is constantly inventing and automating to solve the problem, rather than resorting to manual labor.Some cool problems we are working on:
1. There are 800,000 unique channel lineups with up to 1000 channels each, with millions of unique events. How can you massage the programming information to make TV guide APIs fast?
2. We create software that watches TV to extract thumbnails every second, and analyze the caption and audio data. How can we make this faster and more scalable?
3. How can we create really compelling web applications on custom hardware?
4. How do you implement really custom, unique but simple designs and keep it maintainable?
5. How do we get a mobile device to control a TV?
6. How can we show users the content they will care about most?
7. How can we use data about sports or TV programs to create engaging visualizations?
8. How can we help users interact with each other while watching tv?Email jamison@i.tv for more info. Visit http://i.tv to see the promo stuff.
