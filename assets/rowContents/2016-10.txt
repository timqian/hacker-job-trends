      I like the 24 jobs in 'Remote Oregon'.
                      
                  
      Right, this is an issue. It's need to be decided what to do when there is no location.Said that. I think that the physical location is important (obviously for whoishiring.io is) even if the position is purely REMOTE. Some companies will avoid to add location even in this thread.The company location answers few question. The timezone that the work is going on, the shape of the business / work agreement that could be enforced, money (obviously). Often remote work will require you to buy a ticket and visit the office from time to time.
                      
                  
      If you can't find a job title, why not put the whole first line of the original posting. Better to have that than a sea of "no job title found", imho.
                      
                  
      How did you do that?:)

      Nice site!I was wondering, it seem ski-slopes and -lifts are shown on the map (given a sufficient zoom-factor). Is this on purpose? :)If I had to guess, I would say it is because you public transport is included?
                      
                  
      Hah good one. It's a google maps feature. I think there is a way to disable it. But I could say that ski slopes are there to make a job position even more attractive :)
                      
                  
      Just for everyone's benefit, I've found http://hnhiring.me/ to be simpler to use, as they have a regex filter.
                      
                  
      Very nice site! As some feedback it broke my back button on Firefox though and I couldn't return to HN.
                      
                  
      That's a neat website. What technologies / frameworks were used to create the front-end?
                      
                  
      Thanks.It's Python down under with Elasticsearch, and the UI is AngularJS 1.
                      
                  
      Wicked site, thanks!

      Amazon New Product Demand Forecasting | Seattle | Full-Time | On-Site ($130-$250+ depending on experience)Amazon's New Product Demand Forecasting team is responsible for one of the most challenging problems in supply chain optimization: predicting sales for products that have no sales history. This is a uniquely creative space in Forecasting requiring our machine learning models to capture both the nuances of the global consumer marketplace as well as customer behavior on Amazon. Our team works closely with research scientists to invent new ways to make use of novel data, solve hard engineering problems around scaling and performance in predicting for tens of millions of products, and iterates quickly in order to stay on the cutting edge.
We're looking for an experienced, data-science-leaning software developer that is comfortable with big data and can:* Design systems that provide a stable base for innovation in a rapidly changing business* Improve Forecasting algorithms through data-driven analysis and experimentation in our Scala/Spark environment* Optimize for scalability and performance of both distributed computations and near-metal C++ code* Communicate their ideas clearly with all members of a diverse teamIf this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat or buy you coffee. Email me (Stefan) at smai@ (amazon.com) with your resume and a brief introduction. (Interview process is 1 phone screen and onsite interview with whiteboard coding and behavioral questions about your experience.)
                      
                  
      I have a running bet they offshore or hire in Indian work to replace whoever gets hired for this, and they'll chase the dude out within a year.
                      
                  
      If you could find someone offshore that is smart enough to improve a predictive algorithm by even 0.01%, you should hire them as well.Consider that the holy grail is finding out if customers actually want a product.Break that product down into features, and run a regression. Historically, how well does that do?But these are new products. They have new features. How do you solve that?In a sense this is "the" problem. Anyone who is genuinely additive would be fought over by any company that produces a new product.
                      
                  
      You clearly don't understand the value that engineers in this role are able to create.
                      
                  
      As do most companies / hiring managers in favor of (indiscriminate) offshoring.  Because foreign workers are, you know, "cheaper".

      Not exactly related to the job posting, but I am immensely curious what ISPs you use in Gaza and what their ipv4/ipv6 netblocks, ASNs and upstreams are. The OSI layer 1/2/3 topology of how traffic gets in and out of an embargoed semi-nation-state and the Israel question must be a huge complication.
                      
                  
      Is it actually possible for foreigners to relocate to Gaza to work?
                      
                  
      It is! You'd be commuting into Gaza weekly and spending the weekends in Jerusalem. It does depend on nationality of course but is possible for foreigners to work in Gaza.

      Hi,I sent you e-mail on 09/27 with no reply from your end. So here is a ping. :)
                      
                  
      Hi!Thanks for the ping, your email hasn't been lost! :) Sorry for the delay, my fault, was at a conference at the end of last week, and unfortunately caught a cold after :(Check your inbox - cheers!
                      
                  
      Did, and am impressed at the alacrity of the reply. Replied in turn, let's see what we can do. :)
                      
                  
      I'll post to this thread because this is very relevant for the hiring companies. Hunter and Schmidt did a meta-study of 85 years of research on hiring criteria. [1]
There are three attributes you need to select for to identify performing employees in intellectual fields.  - General mental ability (Are they generally smart)
    Use WAIS or if there are artifacts of GMA(Complex work they've done themselves) available use them as proxies. 
    Using IQ is mostly illegal[2] in the US, so you'll have to find a test that acts as a good proxy.

  - Work sample test. NOT HAZING! As close as possible to the actual work they'd be doing. Try to make it apples-to-apples comparison across candidates. Also, try and make accomidations for candidates not knowing your company shibboleth.

  - Integrity. The first two won't matter if you hire  a sociopath.

     There are existing tests available for this, you can purchase for < $50 per use.
This alone will get you > 65% hit rate [1], and can be done inside of three hours. There's no need for day long (or multi-day) gladiator style gauntlets.[1] http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...[2] The illegality comes from IQ tests disadvantaging certain minority groups.[3] Yes, I'm currently taking freelance work.
                      
                  
      > Using IQ is mostly illegal[2] in the USNo, its not.Like any input that statistically creates a disadvantage for any group defined by a protected criteria, it will, if challenged as discriminatory, require the user to demonstrate that there is sufficient evidence establishing that it is a reasonable predictor of job performance.There is a pervasive myth that IQ tests specifically are "mostly illegal" in the US stemming from an early employment discrimination case in which the particular use was determined to be illegal, but its worth noting that in that case the IQ test was applied widely, it was part of a set of policies that were direct replacements for a policy of explicit racial discrimination (adopted once the company was subjected to nondiscrimination rules), and there was no evidence that could be offered linking it to performance in the jobs for which it was used. [0](It's perhaps worth noting that the case also addressed educational requirements -- the specific one at issue was a high-school diploma requirement -- which was found illegal in the particular use for the same reason as the particular use of the IQ test was, but for some reason no one has gone from that to adopting the idea that specific educational attainment requirements are generally illegal.)[0] Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971)
                      
                  
      Fine, I'll let you apply an IQ test to your hiring process first.Quibble about my word choice all you'd like, but use a direct IQ test at your own peril.
                      
                  
      > Quibble about my word choice all you'd like, but use a direct IQ test at your own peril.Insofar as its true that such a peril exists, the same peril applies for any "test that acts as a good proxy" for an IQ test, since if it does so it will have the same unequal racial impact (because if it didn't, it wouldn't be a good proxy) and, therefore, require the exact same evidence of predictive power with regard to job performance as a "direct IQ test". So the substitution you suggest achieves nothing.Protecting against the "peril" associated with a "direct IQ test" isn't a matter of choosing a "good proxy" instead (since that does nothing to reduce the "peril"), its a matter of documenting the business justification -- the evidence that the test is a good predictor of job performance.
                      
                  
      Upvoted.This is a sound strategy to take. I wish I could convince people to take it.If you can document the business justification then by all means use an IQ test directly in hiring decisions.
                      
                  
      yikes.There are existing tests available to test for being a sociopath...this is super dehumanizing.how about, do the work sample test and a few phone calls with somebody smart. You're going to scare off a lot of very picky people if you seem like you're going to be an irritating test focused person - yes lots of us do well on tests, I really don't want to talk about it every day.
                      
                  
      The employees' attitude is the most important factor to consider in my opinion.
                      
                  
      Yes I'd certainly add attitude and openness. Except I don't have any quantitative research to back that up, so you're just winging it at that point. Which ends us back exactly where we started.GMA, work sample and integrity however DO have quantitative research to back them up.
                      
                  
      Flawed and stupid why? You can't just say non-obvious things like that without backing them up at all.
                      
                  
      Amazon | AmazonUI (AUI) | Seattle; San Francisco | Onsite | Full-TimeAUI is the Front-end platform being adopted on Amazon.com. We are modernizing the company's front end code base, while diving deep on latency, performance, API design, user experience, and cross browser/device compatibility. Basically, we need people who can build libraries, not just use them.Our team is incredibly customer-centric. For any given situation, we have to make the right choice on behalf of the folks using our platform -- and we have to do it at scale. That may sound cliche, but within the next hour AUI will be used to generate tens of millions of page views. And that's just in the US. Worldwide, we're used on more than 95% of requests across all device categories.It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of opportunity. For example, we can run experiments that change almost every page on Amazon.com. We can also impact the page load time for the entire site. We use these tools (but don't expect you to know all of them): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Perl, GitIf you're interested in engineering or technical program manager roles, drop us an email: aui-hn (@) amazon (.) com

      Karr Lab (http://www.karrlab.org) @ Mount Sinai Medical School | New York, NY 10029 | Full-Time | ONSITEThe Karr Lab at the Institute for Genomics & Multiscale Biology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is seeking talented, ambitious engineers to develop technology for building, simulating, and applying cutting-edge whole-cell computational models of individual cells.We are developing whole-cell computational models which comprehensively predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by representing all of the biochemical activity inside cells. Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. Our work is highly interdisciplinary, involving systems biology, genomics, bioinformatics, data integration, parallel simulation, optimization, software engineering, and data visualization, and highly team-oriented.We are looking for software engineers to develop several technologies, including a domain-specific language for describing whole-cell models, a parallel multi-algorithmic simulator, scalable tools for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional simulation results, and tools for handling personal `omics data.More information: http://www.karrlab.org/join or Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu)How to apply: Send a cover letter and a CV to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu)
                      
                  
      I saw Dr. Karr present the Whole-Cell Computational Models a few months ago and I believe it's truly transformative work.  Once you wrap your head around what they do, you'll understand the limitless potential this software could have.  If you're interested, I think these two articles can give you a good idea of what Whole-Cell Modeling is: http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(12)00776-3 https://covert.stanford.edu/publicationpdfs/DMacklin2014.pdf.I applied to work with them at the time but they were low on funding.  I would apply today if I weren't already happily employed.  Good luck Karr Lab!

Backend engineers - Resin's backend is composed of ~10 node.js microservices, each with unique challenges.
UI/Front-end engineers - We're passionate about UX, and have a lot of cool features to build. Most of our UI is in AngularJS but knowledge of other frameworks a plus.
Sales engineers - (ideally in the bay area) - End-to-end understanding of resin.io, ability to work with customers to both teach and guide them to use resin.io effectively. You may need to spend time on-site with customers.
Workflow engineers - Looking for full-stack developers passionate about optimising the way a remote team works.

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsiteRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after four years, almost half of all schools in the US (64,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, weâ€™re looking for senior engineers and engineering managers: empathetic leaders who are excited about teaching, coaching and professional development.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out our newest product release here: https://clever.com/products/badges

We believe weâ€™re on to something big, but to get there weâ€™re working through end-to-end complex problems in a complex and old-fashioned domain. Weâ€™re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.Because of this complexity, we're limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow, or those applicants who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don't apply unless you can demonstrate one of these somehow.Back-end stack: Migrating from C# to Scala. Also a bit of postgres, some simple mongo for non-critical functions, and ASP.NET.

      maybe you wouldn't have to filter such a large number of applicants if you provided any hint more specific than 'engineer' as to the kind of domains you're hiring in.
                      
                  
      Seeing their reply, I suspect they don't actually get a "high volume of applications", it's probably a scare tactic to get people thinking there's many competitor-applicants, and thus induce a scarcity mentality.

      Wellframe | Healthcare | Boston, Ma | Onsite/FulltimeAt Wellframe, we are building an intelligent care-management platform that allows health plans and care-delivery organizations to better manage large populations of complex patients. Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patientsâ€™ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We're currently looking for several mid/senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra/platform) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you're in the area I'd love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you're actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products. We're currently running most of our API on Rails but heavily migrating toward Scala for most of our backend/data services.

      Walmart Technologies East | Reston, VA | Software Engineer - Junior/Mid/Senior On-site - Full-timeThis is a (semi) new branch of Walmart Technologies (not to be confused with Walmartlabs that focuses on the .com site) that is focused on modernizing the stores systems and everything else that is not .com really. This is a great opportunity to work with very smart people in very challenging problems (I actually mean this, I am a software engineer who just started last November and I am astonished at the projects I have been able to work on so far and the technologies I have used). We are a new team, the oldest member has been here a bit over a year, and we are trying to find the best software engineers to grow our team even more. We need them as the scale of the problems we are trying to solve is huge and we put a lot of focus on creating elegant solutions for those problems. One big plus also is that we encourage continuous learning (we have workshops and tech talks often) and we love it when you contribute (or have contributed) to an open source project. We want to give back to the community in different ways too (we volunteer, and do meetups frequently). So if you are super smart, like to be surrounded by smart people and solve difficult distributed problems, and you want to help define and build our office culture, you should contact us!
Just a note. For Junior devs, fresh out of school, we don't care what language you code in (even though we use Java here for the most part so at least you should be willing to learn it).

      David | San Francisco, CA | https://www.senddavid.com | FullÂ­time | Onsite David is a San Francisco-Â­based software startup that combines technology and legal research to help customers resolve disputes with their cable, internet, or wireless service provider.
The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.We currently have a MVP (https://www.senddavid.com) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80Â­-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-Â­4.0% | https://angel.co/david-174/jobs/72943-engineerContact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com

      Shopify | Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Waterloo and now San Francisco!) | Full-time | Onsite | Remote | VISA
Shopify is a platform that allows entrepreneurs to easily setup an online store.
We build solutions that empower merchants at every step of their journey. Our product help merchants who are just starting as well as established brands that need a solution that can scale with their traffic.
We're always working on products that make it easier for entrepreneurs to reach their audience and help them make data driven decisions. Shopify is built in Ruby on Rails running on a stack composed of Docker, Golang, Python, Mysql, Kafka, HDFS and Apache Spark.
If you're interested in building tools that empower Entrepreneurs come take a look at who we are and what we're doing https://jobs.lever.co/shopify?lever-via=XBuWsYM_Q2 https://github.com/Shopify.
                      
                  
      Heads up: developer interviews with Shopify are a sitdown with 2-3 HR people who do not have an ounce of experience in development. You will not meet the CTO, the local office's technical director, or even a team lead developer. The interviewers will not be impressed one iota with your experience, as your interview is purely designed to judge you on a first impression culture fit.If you are not a smooth-talking, 18 year old, ass-kissing fake personality, skip this interview and go to any other company where you will find an interview judging you on merit rather than whether the interviewers want to go to the club with you at midnight on a Friday night.Source: my own 25+ interviews over the years, with 4 employers over a span of 13 years; in addition to two truly senior developer friends who found themselves in the same situation with them. Shopify is 95th percentile worst interview process for software developers and engineers in Canada.
                      
                  
      Iâ€™m a technical recruiter at Shopify (focused on R&D roles), and we work hard to make sure everyone who meets our team feels like theyâ€™ve had an opportunity to express their abilities.Our talent acquisition team is not interested in making hiring decisions for a multi-billion dollar company based on age or whether you want to go clubbing.We base our hiring decisions on some of these things:
a) impact at previous companies/projects and ability to get shit done
b) complexity of projects youâ€™ve tackled
c) potential for growth
d) domain knowledge/technical expertise for the project we think you would be a match for
e) and yes, values alignmentWe value people who have had a big impact in their previous companies or roles, who have been super engaged in past projects, and who can reflect on past experiences to learn what worked, and even more, what didnâ€™t work. These are all positive signals for us and are important to being successful here.Hopefully this clears some misconceptions up, even if your experience wasnâ€™t great.
                      
                  
      So is it true that the screening interview is with 2-3 non-technical HR people?If so, that's completely incompatible with the procedure you've outlined. Non-technical people are by definition not capable of evaluating points a), b), c), or d) on your list.
                      
                  
      That is deeply discouraging.
                      
                  
      I sent in an application last month and did an initial interview.  It was my understanding that I'd be scheduled for two more interviews, at least one of them technical.  Maybe I misunderstood, but in any case no one ever got back to me to say they weren't moving forward with my application.
