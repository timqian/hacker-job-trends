Worldwide, REMOTE, Full time, $100k-$170k. Senior software engineer on https://www.draw.ioWe're a small, all engineering team looking for a strong developer with experience building complex web apps in Vanilla JS.You will need to be a strong starter and able to work effectively in a remote team (no offices here).Everything you produce will be open source, https://www.github.com/jgraph/draw.io. We're 7 digit annual revenue from licensing the tech (much of this is profit) and have no external investment or debt.There's no real hierarchy in the team, no performance reviews and the rest of the crap that bored commercial folks invent. But you will be expected to deliver high quality code, well tested with heavy attention to detail.We don't do roadmaps, either, it's ready when it's ready. Timezone-wise, we're all central and Western Europe. The majority of your working day needs to overlap ours. We're not saying what time difference is the limit, but as you go past +/- 4 GMT, you'd need to be thinking about moving your working day hours to work here.Apply with CV to jobs@jgraph.com
                      
                  
      We've had 320 applications so far. We'll try to respond to everyone, but there's a ton of applications that simply haven't read what I wrote above. You need to address the time-zone issue if you're in the US or Asia, and you need to show strong, recent, professional JS experience.
                      
                  
      congrats ahead of time to whomever lands this gig... :)
                      
                  
      Yes, this sounds like paradise
                      
                  
      One of the best diagramming tools. Love your product. Thanks for the awesome free tool.
                      
                  
      I know a lot of software engineering students here in Denmark who use your product frequently. It's a good product; thank you!
                      
                  
      That is impressive, it's like rational rose or visio on the web.. one to bookmark for sure.
I like the idea of a recipe layer on top of this, so you can remix diagrams.Great work
                      
                  
      Commenting just to say had this is a great startup story.
                      
                  
      I love bootstrapped startups! Is most of your revenue from Confluence plugin licensing? I couldn't find a price for the product anywhere.
                      
                  
      It's 100% from licensing the tech to another company that sells the Confluence plugin.We don't "sell" anything, thus no non-commercial functions in company.But, we've also 90k unique users using the free online version daily. You can be part of getting that to 1M :)
                      
                  
      Is draw.io actually Gliffy or is it a clone of Gliffy?
                      
                  
      Neither, our tech stack pre-dates Gliffy.
                      
                  
      I have used draw.io a few times for creating flow charts and some architectural diagrams. I should say, I really loved it.
                      
                  
      I'm one of your users! Great software and experience btw;)
                      
                  
      one more from your fanclub. Great product. love from INDIA :)

      This seems really neat! What sorts of background and skills do you look for in candidates? I've enjoyed working on simple/toy lexers and parser in the past, but I'm not sure that'd be enough to get started with the kind of work your website describes.
                      
                  
      We are looking for experienced Java Developers (currently we have devs in UK, Portugal, Canada and USA).
                      
                  
      Curious why you didn't choose OCaml or Haskell
                      
                  
      it would be even harder to find OCaml/Haskell developers :)
                      
                  
      what about clojure?
                      
                  
      We are a Java shop .. there is a long history to the initial decision and the implications. Currently we have about 500,000 lines of code to maintain per developer.With that said we have worked with developers proficient in other languages. Those experiences have taught us to avoid "religious" arguments about our development environment. We have made the practical decision to hire only those who follow the same religion. Does that make us biased? I guess so!

      No offense intended, but isn't that a huge salary for a startup? Your burn rate must be massive!
                      
                  
      Weâ€™re one year in the market and already profitable. Believe it or not, many engineers are earning much bigger salaries in financial companies, and our software has similar security and reliability requirements as a financial app.These are our first hires. We want the best we can afford.
                      
                  
      If you've been on the market for a year and are already profitable why are you still in stealth mode?
                      
                  
      This guy gets it.  Congrats, and best of luck!
                      
                  
      - One year in the market and already profitable- In stealth mode- Making first hiresHow does that add up?
                      
                  
      Gotta pay for quality, GOOG / FB / etc pay far more than that w/ liquid equity.
                      
                  
      True, but GOOG, FB, etc aren't startups with limited funds
                      
                  
      2x normal salary isn't massive. Some startups get 5 mil investment, others get 10 â€” not a huge deal imo.
                      
                  
      I wouldn't even say that's 2x a 'normal' salary.  I'd say that's about the right range for senior talent with a proven history to execute.  Pay peanuts, get monkeys.  These folks want results, and they know the surefire way to get them.
                      
                  
      I'm not a recruiter, I'm an engineer, a regular HNer for 5+ years and 2k+ karma. I'm external to the company, that's correct, because every contractor/freelancer actually is "external". I've been tasked with finding talent on dev forums and GitHub, earning a "finder's fee" for the extra-hours I'm doing. The offer and role has been depicted accurately and redacted with the input of all the team.Management and lead engineers are available for backing up these claims. So far, he's refused to speak with the lead engineers for clarification.We do know who this guy is. He's a front-ender that somehow misinterpreted a recommendation for reading about basic SPA security before the interview (XSS, CSRF, input sanitisation, etc) with a bait-and-switch tactic for an AppSec role. The requirements are clear: https://goo.gl/CXqBrQ. We need people building games and features, if you are security minded, it's a huge plus, that's all.
                      
                  
      I've worked at companies that have offices in Toronto, Canada (where I currently live) while their main offices are abroad (US and CuraÃ§ao).They seem to have have a lot of problems with us having different laws and regulations than them (eg: healthcare, holidays) and we're only one country. How does that work when everyone is from different countries?

Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why weâ€™re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteranâ€™s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.Itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      Are you willing to consider currently enrolled MRes students for an internship/part-time equivalent of this position?
                      
                  
      We currently have a filled research intern position. For 2018 we will have a similar research intern position open. But for 2017 the position is filled [https://mzl.la/1Wf4JJh]
                      
                  
      Thanks for answering! Let me clarify my question - I was asking about a during-the-school-year internship, not a summer internship. Does Mozilla have something like that, or would Mozilla be open to creating something like that?

      I'm surprised at the line regarding the need for work authorisation in the US. I would've assumed that Microsoft would be willing to arrange visas for those of us outside of America.
                      
                  
      Really love what you guys are doing with VSTS. The UI and features for CI builds are coming along nicely. We're big fans at my company.Now if only you could fix that cost of living in Seattle... :)
                      
                  
      Considering average tech pay in Seattle, Seattle's cost of living isn't much of an issue compared to say the Bay Area.
                      
                  
      Join us in Raleigh, then? =P
                      
                  
      Would love to work on VSTS and implement alllll the missing features and fix the broken parts of the UI.We're using it at work and have a love/hate relationship with it.But I'm not leaving Singapore.
                      
                  
      Wow, you guys have done some really neat stuff - I can't believe I somehow missed it. All C# on the backend, or anything else? Any Golang in play yet?
                      
                  
      Mostly C# and SQL Server in the backend.  WRT Go, we've made a few contributions to the Git LFS client, but it's not something we use in the core backend code b/c it doesn't really integrate with ASP.NET.
                      
                  
      Any remote/edh options? I live in NYC
                      
                  
      We have a lot of remote folks. Location shouldn't be a blocker.

      @pabloadolescent : It sounds like you may have had a negative experience, and I'm certainly sorry to hear that.@BuckRogers : We certainly respect your right to not apply if you do not like the process. That is why we are very up front about it on our application page and publicly post all the challenges in GitHub. Folks are welcome to review them prior to applying to decide with full knowledge of what may be asked. There shouldn't be any surprises. The challenges have remained largely the same for years and are in no way a method to get free labor.We ask for the code challenges because we believe that the quality of your code is more important than the quality of your resume. The challenges are graded "blind" with each assignment given a random identifier. Each submission for each challenge is generally independently reviewed by 3 of our engineers. We feel that if we've asked you to spend time on something, we should also be willing to commit a significant chunk of our company's time into reviewing it.The code challenges are the first step in the process, before any formal interviews, for two main reasons:1) We want to give our engineers (not the recruiters or managers) the primary say on who their peers will be. This is ensure that our engineering culture stays strong.2) We want to mitigate the impacts of as many unconscious biases that folks may have around any aspect of a candidate by having the "blind," skills-based review come as early as possible.Additionally, this sort of code challenge is a far better proxy for the kind of remote work that we do than more "traditional" methods like white boarding or brain teasers.No process is perfect. Ours certainly results in great engineers passing us by and has its fair share of false negatives. Any process will unavoidably result in the same.We do work to ensure that our process is not an undue burden on any applicant.- We designed the challenges so that most applicants can complete each in about two hours. If our feedback indicates that's not the case, we do make tweaks to them to adjust.- We encourage applicants to pick only the 1 or 2 challenges that best represent their skills for the initial submission. This should minimize the "up front" costs of starting an application. The majority of applicants will end up completing 3 total, often over the course of a few weeks to amortize the time commitment.- We try to keep the total time commitment to be, on average, roughly 8 hours. In addition to the average of three challenges, we normally have 3-4 half hour interviews (either on the phone or video chat). In this way, our process is roughly equivalent to a one-day "in person" process, but with the ability to flexibly schedule things to what works best for the candidate (and avoids additional overhead for time to travel to/from a location).Our current process is the result of much experience and reflection, but I'll spare everyone the dissertation on it all. Hopefully the above provides some useful context for those considering applying.
                      
                  
      I appreciate you taking the time to respond.  I do think the various homework problems are fair and pretty well designed.  If 3 people have reviewed each submission, I would have expected to get some feedback besides you are passing.  If it is a rigorous review process then you should be able to easily say what criteria were not met.  I think there is also the perception that the roles you can complete homework for, correspond to a current job opening.  The applicant has no idea what your hiring timeline is and it may take them a week or two to submit all of the required assignments.
                      
                  
      Honestly, feedback is the number one unresolved issue we have internally with the current process. We would love to give more feedback in a constructive manner on either code challenges or position fit. We can't even give our hired employees detailed feedback on their challenges after they've started.I'm not a lawyer or HR professional so take this as just my personal ramblings not an official legal or company opinion. But, basically, as I understand it, because we're a federal contractor we're subject to some very strict federal regulations around hiring process and record retention. Additionally, as a remote company, we're subject to a hodge-podge of state level laws and regulations. Sadly, the combined impact means the only safe course is to not give any detailed feedback on code challenges to anybody.That feels deeply unsatisfying on a number of levels, at least to myself personally, but it's the honest reason we can't as best as I understand it.
                      
                  
      Seems like a cool company.. but there are other cool companies that don't require me to spend 4 hours before I get to even talk to anyone.
                      
                  
      @devmpk : I totally get that. I sincerely wish you the best of luck with those other companies. We're not right for everybody, and everybody isn't right for us.We're working on societal problems that impact millions of lives in meaningful ways. That kind of change doesn't come easy.We want people who are passionate about our mission and passionate about solving those problems. People who will persevere through the inevitable bumps in the road. When your company is forged in the crucible of the healthcare.gov turnaround, willingness to fight through adversity is deep in its DNA.For the people not passionate enough about our mission to tackle the code challenges, what good would a phone call first do? We'd just end up using 30 minutes of your time to figure that out and say "No thanks." That doesn't feel very useful or respectful of your time, at least to me personally.Each solution turned in takes about 1.5-2 hours total of our engineers' time to review. It's a meaningful commitment since we see no revenue for that time. It's worth it to us to weed out those with a "spray and pray" application model right up front, so that we don't keep asking our engineers to spend meaningful time on candidates who aren't really interested in us.Our hiring process isn't going to be everybody's liking, and we're going to miss out on some great folks because of that. It's just a cost of doing business. No hiring model is perfect including ours.But, our experience has shown that the cost of deterring the multitude of minimally interested candidates to allow us to put more resources into reviewing the passionate candidates has been worth it. That trade-off wouldn't work for every company, but it's been useful for us thus far.
                      
                  
      You should have a bypass rule for people who have github projects of credibility. It encourages OSS and saves time.
                      
                  
      We've discussed that in the past and will likely discuss again in the future.The value of the challenges over Github reviews are 1) allows us to anonymize the process, 2) eases level-setting and adjustment across the reviewers to prevent a "hard grader" throwing off the overall review, and 3) doesn't bias against those whose workplaces did not allow or encourage open source contributions. It gives us a consistent baseline as a starting point.GitHub (or other open source code contributions) can come into play after the initial code challenge portion is passed and can be a great point of discussion in the interviews. We're definitely advocates for open source, especially in terms of making our work on behalf the people of America available to them in source format as much as possible.For us, at least, we've found having a consistent first step to the recruiting process to be very beneficial in terms of giving everyone an equal starting point for consideration. It's proven difficult to come up with a method for weighing side projects versus open sourced work projects versus contributions to existing projects in a manner that has felt consistent and fair to candidates.
                      
                  
      BRIEF: The code round cannot really be a differentiator. It should be used as an elimination round and carry grades to next rounds.REASON: Some people might want to do a bare minimum (because they are busy) and other who have more space can go overboard. It might be normalizing at your end, but you are ignoring that all test takers will not treat the test alike (its not a SAT for them).DETAILS:hmm what will a 4-8 hour coding challenge tell you that an open source project wont? If you give someone a coding challenge, possibly these are the things that you would rate the submission on. An open source project can equally show below.1. Codeing test - Basic solution  a. Bare bone working application
  b. Breaking complexities into testable parts
  c. Usage documentation or a read me file
  d. Commenting in code

Bonus points: for using any interesting algo2. Architecture test - Improves over the basic solution (faster, more maintainable, etc)  a. Importing data
  b. Database design
  c. API design
  d. Adding testcases

3. Product thinking - Improves over the problem statement  a. Building on top of the scope 

4. Misc. (... stretching it a bit more)  a. Did I learn something new doing it? - tech wise, product wise, etc
  b. How much time do I allocate for it?
  c. When do I allocate time for it?
  d. Is it similar to any older project, etc...?

((I had these listed somewhere in the mail))
                      
                  
      Yes, I meant to agree with you that we can learn the same things from open source as a coding challenge, which is why we've considered it.We're still a small company (but growing quickly). The code challenges are a simpler way to get the desired end goal. As we grow larger and have more capacity to devote to designing and refining an additional process around open source reviews, I think it's something we may explore. I'm not a decision-maker on that, so just my opinion. No disagreement in principle on this point, we just made a practical decision based on our constraints at the moment.
                      
                  
      I want you guys to know that there are a number of people, such as myself, who overwhelmingly prefer coding assignments over whiteboarding, tech Q&A, or rattling off a string of accomplishments that are already covered in the resume.It would be nice if devs were paid a modest sum ($75 Amazon Gift Card) for completing them. However, I never view them as a waste of my time because I always shoehorn some tech, tool, library, etc. that I've been meaning to study anyway. Also, if it doesn't work out, after some slight refactoring I now have another open-source project on github.Also, I only do coding assignments for companies that I have targeted and have a desire to work for. In that way, it works as a handy filter. This is especially important for remote positions.
                      
                  
      Coinbase | Senior Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Security Engineer | San Francisco, London | REMOTE, VISA | coinbase.comWe are hiring engineers to help us create an open financial system for the world. Specifically, I'm hiring both frontend and backend engineers to build Coinbase.com and the APIs that power the Coinbase mobile apps. Come work on digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum every day!About us:* We use React, Mobx, Flow, webpack, and styled-components on the frontend.* Our APIs are currently powered by Rails with a MongoDB backend, but we're investing heavily in decomposing the monolith into services written in statically typed languages.* We're exploring GraphQL for future APIs and are hiring two people to lead our APIs team.If you're interested, email me at jpollak@coinbase.com. I'm also more than happy to answer questions on here (about Coinbase in general or the roles).NOTE: A spammer posted this same post below, not sure why.

      Amazon Web Services | SDE / SysDE / Research/Data Scientist | Seattle, Palo Alto (ONSITE) | VISA, aws.amazon.com, AS16509The Internet is the worldâ€™s most complex network, with over 57,402 unique networks connected together, it contains hundreds of millions of edges and nodes. It is THE most pervasive, important, and complicated communications network in the world -- somewhere out there things are about to go south. One of the core backbone routers of a major Tier-1 Internet provider is having a bad day. It started with a transient, yet persistent, problem which was only detectable by a slight increase in dropped packets that went mostly unnoticed. An hour later the router suffered a catastrophic failure dumping 500Gbps of traffic onto an already congested alternate path causing ripples across the Internet, disrupting websites and other Internet based services on the U.S Eastern seaboard. Social media is ablaze as frustrated people rant about their favorite website, video, or gaming service being down, or so slow that itâ€™s unusable. While the Internet burns, our customers are humming away oblivious to the disaster.

      How are you distinguishing between entry level and recent grads ?
                      
                  
      Amazon has a separate college-hire program for those who are just out of college. If you've had 1+ year experience we'd likely consider that entry level depending on how you level in the interview, etc.
                      
                  
      Thank you for the clarification. Do you also hire entry level product/program managers ?
                      
                  
      My team isn't currently looking for any, and I'm not experienced with those roles. I'd assume yes, but couldn't say for sure.
                      
                  
      Panasonic Automotive | Senior Software Engineer | Denver | Full-Time | On-sitePanasonic is building a connected vehicle system for car-to-car, car-to-operator, operator-to-car, and accident/weather/etc detection. We're still a fairly small team within the larger Panasonic, but we're growing and are looking for someone senior to take the frontend.The frontend app is Go in the back and react/redux in the front using google maps to do some of the heavy lifting, and several custom layers on top of gmaps. The app (back and front) has to stream data at super high rates over websocket (alongside traditional REST) (cars send a lot of data!) and have it available in near real-time, so there are many interesting high-data-flow visualization, correlation, and aggregation problems that ends up happening in or near the frontend. The future probably holds a fair amount of svg drawing work, which should be pretty cool (graphs, animations, that sort of thing).Auxilliary technologies include Karma/Jasmine/Enzyme for testing (which is also quite interesting on this project, given the high data flow and reliance on drawing tools), webpack and babel for build, concourse.ci for CI and automated deploy, AWS as our IaaS.If you're interested in talking to an engineer about what we do, hit me up at jadekler@gmail.com.If you're interested in applying or talking to a recruiter about the job, hit up Jessie at jesseyjean@gmail.com.

      I'm interested in crypto but never programmed anything like that. Almost exclusively web programming but a lot of Go.Worth applying? I'm interesting in learning.

Don't even be in that line-- let alone at the front of it.Let the company tell you no; don't tell yourself for them.

      American spell-checkers have ruined me.
                      
                  
      Interested! Do you guys support Visa sponsorships and relocation if required?
                      
                  
      There's been a fair number of folks over the years from outside of Canada working at the office. Not sure how relocation works from elsewhere, but I know Amazon has a relocation team.
