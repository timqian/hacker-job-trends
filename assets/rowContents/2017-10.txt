      Guys you have confused UI/UX for visual design, going through your post I think you would benefit by renaming the job to Visual designer. UX designers don't design illustrations for marketing material and logos.
                      
                  
      Very true. However, I need both a UI/UX designer for apps and a Visual Designer for marketing material. I believe we just called it Marketing Designer but you are correct that Visual is the proper title. Either way we are looking for all types of talented designers to fill a couple spots on the design team. Next time I need to remember to put both.
                      
                  
      Would you consider a remote (in Canada) person for this position?
                      
                  
      At this time on-site only but I will gladly take your CV if that changes.
                      
                  
      I wish :(I work for an adult content company right and would have to wait 1 year after I leave the position before I work for another adult company.
                      
                  
      In the US at least, states enforce non-competes with varying degrees of vigor. It be might worth having a quick chat with an attorney.
                      
                  
      Hi there,I can most certainly say that in Ontario, Canada, a non-compete agreement barring one from working within their field of specialty for such a long term as 1 year, and at any location, is unenforceable. That would approach a human rights violation. Work on!
                      
                  
      Quebec laws may be different where it comes to what may fall under human rights statutes?
                      
                  
      I don't know about human rights, but I've had this issue come up in the past. Went and saw a lawyer about it and the outcome was basically they can't stop you from working in your chosen field. It would be a different story though if you went to a rival company and took clients with you.
                      
                  
      Are you guys hiring interns?
                      
                  
      I don't want my family and friends to be ashamed of me. If I get the job, will people know I use PHP?
                      
                  
      Hahah, that was a good one

      Dropbox | Engineering | San Francisco, CA | Full-Time | OnsiteDropbox builds what is (by some measure) one of the largest distributed systems on the planet -- hundreds of millions of devices syncing amidst each other, pushing around both data and metadata at a scale that only a handful of companies across the world could muster.We're hiring for pretty much any role you could imagine, but I'll give a particular plug for the team I lead here: Sync Platform. Sync Platform houses all of the core sync logic that makes Dropbox tick, from the core sync engine itself to the metadata stores on the back-end and the sync protocol we speak between them. We're rebuilding significant pieces of our entire stack in preparation for the next ten years (as we've already been around for ten). These are some of the biggest changes to sync since the company was founded.We're looking for motivated senior-level engineers. We write mostly in Rust, Go and Python. We do a lot of distributed systems work, so expertise there is a bonus but by no means a requirement. Keeping our user's data safe and consistent is sacrosanct so most important is a strong attention to detail to ensure that we do right by our users. Equally important is an ability to work constructively in an diverse, equitable and inclusive environment.Reach out to bn@dropbox.com if interested!

      Where about is Arduino looking to use Go? I shared this comment over at #arduino on freenode (550+ active community users) and a couple of people are surprised but most of all curious about what this means or where it might signal Arduino is heading!
                      
                  
      I was also curious. Go and microcontrollers? Must be a misunderstanding and not Go the language.
                      
                  
      The worst part about using Go for embedded systems is that there's no way to disable dynamic memory allocation (which can be unreliable and/or hard to reason about) - at least last I checked. This is brought up in the essay "Go is Not Good".Memory-mapped I/O is possible, but there's no way to separate such unsafe constructs from "safe" ones, as that essay points out.
                      
                  
      Well, it's absolutely worth remembering that Arduino the ecosystem is much larger than 8-bit uCs. Arduino now supports from tiny 8-bit uCs with hundreds of bytes of ram to expansive ARM devices comparable to those you'd find in drones and other large devices.Additionally, they maintain an IDE, a complex set of pre-processing tools, and library+device management servers that allow more modularity in the ecosystem.I'm sure there's a place for Go, I'm just not sure where they plan to put it.
                      
                  
      Wouldn't rust be a better fit?
                      
                  
      If you're using a device that isn't necessarily weak in terms of processing power and RAM, the Go vs. Rust debate AFAIK is basically about preference. There are features of each language that make them appealing in different ways; the major drawback from Go is in relation to binary size, memory management and general performance bloat.Source: I write Go code that runs on microcontrollers.

      For infra/systems/devops engineers, Avoid - they screen you via a Codility test and they expect you to have a 100% score for it, with a 60min time limit for two lengthy problems. Anything below 100% is not enough.Testing infra engineers for algorithms is plain stupid, completely irrelevant and a total waste of time as it does not translate as a test for any other infra specific skill one might have (problem solving / analysis / troubleshooting / systems design / et cetera).

      These guys don't even have the decency to respond to applicants, even after a few followups via different channels. Took the time to submit resume, cover, and pinged a few times over multiple weeks, never heard a single peep back. Not even so much as a thanks but we aren't interested.
                      
                  
      Yep, these folks are a total time waste. Both me and a coworker had the exact same experience you described.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the heads up. It's sketchy enough they don't even offer healthcare until you have worked their 90 days, but knowing they wast applicant's time is a huge benefit.

      CareEvolution | Software Dev | Ann Arbor, MI | ONSITE, REMOTE, VISA, https://www.careevolution.com/What we do actually matters.It's estimated that 250,000 people die in America annually because of medical errors. That makes it the #3 cause of death, just behind heart disease and cancer (http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/03/47663618...). This is a major societal catastrophe - and it needs to be fixed. Part of the solution is the long-overdue modernization of our nation's health IT infrastructure. This is CareEvolution's mission - to create better patient outcomes by modernizing - and connecting - our health IT systems.There are many interesting things to do at CareEvolution, including mobile (iOS and Android), web, platform, integration, devops, analytics, ETL... and lots more. This is a place where you help define what it is you want to do, and how to help the world.We're a small team - still under 100 people (and all technical!) - but our platform manages health data for over 100 million people.Check out our job listing at https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/148257/developers-for-healthc... .Visit our website at https://www.careevolution.com/ - or visit our recruiting portal at http://letsfixhealthcare.com/Submit resumes to resume@careevolution.com
                      
                  
      The most important part:"Note: this job is open to US Residents only.  Foreign nationals can apply but only if you live within the US."
                      
                  
      I applied once about a month ago, through SO, as linked in this post. I did not get a response, not even a cursory one. As you can see in that thread [0], someone tells care evolution that their link is dead. They do not get a response. Basically, this organization is pretty bad at engaging. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth as an applicant. It takes time on both sides; hiring and applying. Not taking the time to respond to applicants or potential applicants looks bad, and discourages interest.[0]:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15150831
                      
                  
      Original poster here.As someone else suggested in this thread, we do get a pretty incredible volume of applicants.  If it's clear from the resume that it's not a match, we generally don't contact the applicant.  In an ideal world we would prefer to get back to each person who submits a resume - but the volume is such that we have decided not to do that.However, we do carefully read every application.  And once we engage with an applicant, we always respond and we respond promptly.
                      
                  
      Hey John, thank you for responding. I hope you take this as feedback, for I truly have no grudge or bitterness about it. If you looked at my resume and decided you're looking for something else, that's totally fine. I want to empathize with your role as an employer, and I ask that you do the same for me. As a candidate, I am applying to a dozen different places, amidst a busy life. Some communication helps keep everything together. It doesn't even have to be human but 
1. Acknowledge receipt of my application. 
2. Confirm that you've moved on to other applicants.At some point, as your company grows, your recruiters may trawl the backlog of past applicants and decide to give me another look. It then becomes a question of how I remember my interactions with you. If you didn't have the time or systems to give me even the most cursory of feedback, you best believe I won't have the time to give you that either. 
So sure, there are hundreds of names, flying at you. But those names are people. A templated rejection letter is really the least you can do. Most applicant tracking systems support this.
                      
                  
      Totally agree with you here. All of this is automated these days.
                      
                  
      if you have to use a throway foo bar, whey do they need to get back to you? It's as a curtsey but don't think it's necessary. It's possible job hunters just spam resume for no reason. To me, a template reply is no better than a no rely.
                      
                  
      > if you have to use a throway foo barAd-hominem.> It's as a curtsey but don't think it's necessary.The job hunt process is lubricated with politeness. Both employer and employee should want to make a good impression on each other; like on a first date. I can't imagine a situation where courtesy was more necessary than that. More so, when it costs next to nothing to send out an AUTOMATED email1) Acknowledging receipt of an application and thanking the candidate. [Enables the candidate to keep records in a busy life]2) Informing them you've moved on, and how soon they are allowed to apply again [Typically >3months].
                      
                  
      I empathize with them as well. But I hope my comment showed that there is a pattern of undesirable behavior here. Moreover, you shouldn't be reposting a job posting while still, presumably, working the backlog of candidates from a month ago.
                      
                  
      Anything with REMOTE gets 50+ applications a week over at angel.co. There are also a lot of junk resumes to sort through in every job. You have to sell yourself well or have a network of connections who can put in a good word for you.
                      
                  
      Just a suggestion: your guys would benefit from a "who are we" section in your website. =)(Sorry if it's there and I missed it.)
                      
                  
      I don't think you missed it.  Our corporate website is definitely geared towards marketing to potential customers, and not as much to candidates.I think the most concise expression of "who we are" in terms of mission and values is probably our recruiting site - http://www.letsfixhealthcare.com/.Our StackOverflow company page ( https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/careevolution ) may also give you a sense of the vibe at CareEvolution.Thanks for the comments!
                      
                  
      What percentage of your employees are remote?
                      
                  
      I don't recall where, but while going through one of the links above I saw the numbers:45% on-site, 55% remote
                      
                  
      Yeah those numbers are a little outdated... just counted, we have 90 folks total and very close to 2/3 of my colleagues are remote.

      Hi Jemaclus,
Do you offer relocation assistance? What about visa sponsorships?
Also, is remote work an option and what are the salary bands?
Thanks !
                      
                  
      I'm pretty sure we do visa sponsorships, but I'll have to check. Re: remote work, we have a fun office culture and like to talk face-to-face as much as possible. That said, we do have some people that work from home periodically, but we don't hire full-time remote workers.The salary depends on whether you're in San Francisco or Birmingham, as well as which position you get and your experience level. I'm not 100% sure what the salary bands are, per se, but I'm happy with my compensation, and I think you would be too.

      Ozora Research | Engineers, Scientists, Linguists | Berkeley, CA | Part-Time | Onsite | EquityMy company Ozora Research is developing a next-generation suite of Natural Language Processing tools centered around sentence parsing. The field of NLP parsing has been moving slowly for the last 20 years because of its utter dependence on labelled training data such as the Penn Treebank. In my research I've discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. Even though its still in the early stages of development, the parser works quite well, makes more refined grammatical distinctions than any other widely available parser, and was built without any labelled training data. I've spent the last couple of years working on my own, and now that I'm confident the approach is valid, I'm looking to build up a team. I'm flexible on exact qualifications, but here are general blueprint of what I'm looking for:- Strong programming and software architecture skills- Good background in math, statistics, machine learning, information theory- Deep interest in language and linguisticsThe software is built in Java, Postgres, and AWS, but I won't ask for any specific technology as long as you have demonstrable programming skill.I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won't be for everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I'm happy to talk more about the specifics in person. Email me at daniel dot burfoot at gmail.

      This is off-topic for this thread. If you're not interested in working for the company or don't think it would be a good fit for whatever reason, just don't apply. Same as someone calling out a tech stack they don't like: it's just what the Who is hiring? threads are for.
                      
                  
      I fail to see the off-topicness of this.This is only 1 step removed from "We prefer only $religion here." Or another way to look at it, is "We dont like $your_religion." They aren't out-right saying that, but the dog-whistles are most certainly there, biblical quotes and all.No matter how you shake it (by preference or by refusal), it's coming mightily close to breaking federal law as cited here: https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/religion.cfmI would understand if the organization was a church or religious group. But it seems to be pretty bog-standard tech shop. It, at absolute minimum, is a warning sign of potential religious discrimination. To put it bluntly, unless there's a religious component in the nature of the job, the very fact that religion is mentioned on their pages is at best off-topic, a warning sign to all, and at worst a potential sign of EEOC violations.
                      
                  
      If the legality is what concerns you, fair enough, though I do think you're overreacting without further evidence. People are perfectly capable of holding beliefs and hire and work with people who share others. However, that is not how you presented it or are discussing further.
                      
                  
      You certainly wouldn't fit into the "no-drama office policy".

      I see one of the founders of Playdom is a co-founder here.  One of the criticisms I heard about Playdom is that they completely fucked over early employees with very few options.  For example, when Playdom exited for $600M, employees in the 30-ish range only made about $30,000 in Disney stock, whereas the founders made $100M+.  Is this true and would this be the same case with Brava as well?
                      
                  
      I don't know anything about that situation but I, and at least a half dozen others here, were Playdom/Disney employees. I feel I did just fine in the Disney acquisition.
                      
                  
      Okay thanks for the answer.  I know two people who were early employees at Playdom and they both got fucked, and they both said that most people left with a disproportionately small exit, unlike companies like Facebook or Google that were more generous with their employee stock options.  This would be my biggest concern with a company like Brava so caveat emptor.
                      
                  
      As a fun aside, Disney stock has roughly tripled since the acquisition in 2010.... https://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ADIS&ei=jrzSWcCRD...
