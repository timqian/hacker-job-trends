      > Must be willing to work extended hours and weekends as neededI know this happens in pretty much all software based companies but SpaceX is the only one I have seen which explicitly states that on their hiring page.
                      
                  
      This DOES NOT happen in all software based companies. I don't get why people believe that its ok to be a slave.
                      
                  
      Of the three companies I've worked for in Seattle--one Fortune 500, one small consulting firm, one slightly bigger than startup SaaS--none of them expected more than 40 hours. And only the SaaS had an on-call rotation, but off hour work even for the on-call person has been very rare.
                      
                  
      It's fairly common, and it's not anything like slavery when there is effective management and the "as needed" is genuine emergent situations, not routine failures to plan predictable work within a reasonable work schedule.
                      
                  
      The fact that this is common means nothing - what kind of argument is that... law breaking and human exploitation is also fairly common - does that mean it OK to do it?> "Must be willing to work extended hours and weekends as needed".
I also had some emergency situations where I had to fix something or help someone - and it is normal for me - but I can count that using fingers of one hand during a year.What is NOT normal and should instantly raise red lights is that this is part of job description. Stop pretending it OK to do this in a company that is managed properly it should not take place.
                      
                  
      There is a lot of room between "it's okay" and "it's slavery".In this case, if "as needed" means "during the occasional launches of our experimental rockets, because launch windows happen at sometimes awkward times", it's quite a bit more understandable than "pretty much every deliverable, because we poorly set arbitrary deadlines."Your initial point was good - it does not happen at "pretty much every" software company.  I am not sure it's a red flag here, depending on the actual intent.
                      
                  
      Sure, the only problem I see here than some people that work on startups think it's OK to force people to work overtime all the time - and for them it's the norm - where it should be an exception.I saw it multiple times it even sometimes ends up with lawsuits like @ LinkedIn. I truly believe people can succeed without creating this kind of bad work culture.
                      
                  
      You are my hero.
                      
                  
      As always SpaceX and it's mission is just _cool_ (in a geek sense). However, to be honest, Python + rocket code in the same sentence perturbs me somewhat. Python is great for web automation tools and simple scripting situations, but for the love of humanity (seriously, because space travel & exploration), I shudder at the idea of Python being used in a complex rocket control system. Does the team use other tools for embedded or distributed controls?
                      
                  
      The job description above is for internal user-facing tools. Mission-critical systems are done in C++.[1][1] https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/slug/c8bpr00
                      
                  
      That makes much more sense, the job posting seemed more likely a fit for internal user interface tools. Python certainly is a good fit there, but adding in the parts about touching the rocket code seems... well I just can't comprehend the idea of running Python on a rocket at launch time. Then again, maybe all the cool rocket systems will start having REST APIs. ;)`curl -X POST rocket10.falcon-9.spacex.com/engine/ignite -d '{"countdown": 10}'`Would both be amazing and terrifying!P.S. @parent: I admire the work y'all are doing, Dozbog!
                      
                  
      you don't need the `-X POST`, because `-d` will do a post by default :)
                      
                  
      all the systems AND PARAMETERS are redundant in such mission...
                      
                  
      facepalm
                      
                  
      Python has had for a very long time both NASA and JPL as marquee customers/users, eg. http://montepy.jpl.nasa.gov/ for mission planning and control applications.From the MONTE brochure:The story of MONTE begins in 1998, when JPLâ€™s navigation section commissioned an update to the aging DPTRAJ/ODP library. The goal was to translate these time-tested navigation algorithms from Fortran into a more maintainable, extensible, and better tested C++/Python application.
                      
                  
      Fair enough, though reading some histories there's been a variety of languages used at JPL/NASA, and Python/C++ is a latecomer [1], [2].1: http://wiki.c2.com/?MarsSpiritSoftwareProblem
2: http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.htmlAt the end of the day, if Python/C++ is effective for their team and works, then it gets the job done. Personally, I just dislike writing math/simulation code in Python. The syntax is too limiting for that topic and I've run into rather annoying delays when parsing CSV data due to utf8 vs byte vs ascii handling differences when mixing Pyhton 2/3. But mainly, deploying Python code to other users is a pain.
                      
                  
      Python is very popular for doing mathematical modelling in every domain you could possibly imagine.  Even when the core algorithm isn't done in python, python is great for pre-,and post-processing the results, analysis and gluing everything together.
                      
                  
      It's a shame -- and slightly surprises me -- that ITAR applies to roles like this. Does it apply to entire orgs, or is SpaceX to small to be worth the trouble of creating separate legal categories of employees?
                      
                  
      One of the great things about this job is that we have to interact with a lot of teams across the company - so the clearance is definitely necessary and reduces red tape.
                      
                  
      I know that only US Citizens and Green Card holders can work for SpaceX.I know that I might not be guy who flies to Mars in the first batch but I definitely want to add mine 2Â¢.(mostly around intuitive user interfaces)An alternative is to open subsidiary in the UK / EU...
                      
                  
      Unfortunately just opening a subsidiary in another country doesn't help, one of the 'features' of ITAR is that it is extraterritorial, so even if you open a subsidiary in another country all the ITAR provisions apply in that country, as well as all the export controls of that country. It's tons of fun even working for a Canadian company.

      Hey, a friendly reminder. Iâ€™m parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map onhttps://whoishiring.ioIf you post here:Last month (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13080505) Iâ€™ve started a small campaign to update thread format and make it more parser friendly for whoishiring.io and others website I know that at least few websites that do similar thing.As a result off this calling, many posters actually complied. Which resulted in more accurate map positions, better tagging (REMOTE, VISA, INTERNSHIP, â€¦) and for some I was even able to get logos. Thanks!Here is the format.  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, company url}
  Google | Software Developer | SF | VISA https://google.com
  DuckDuckGo | Software Developer | Paoli PA | REMOTE, VISA
or  2) {company} | {job title} | {locations}
  Google | Site Reliability Engineer | London, Zurich, Sydney
  Facebook | Web-developer | London, Zurich

Iâ€™m using this regex to test the firstline.  \s*(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s*(?:\|\s*(?P<attrs>.+))?$

You can test it in Python or here https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/3 (for the match look right).
                      
                  
      I think this is a good idea. Some problems:* I have limited character allocation to wax poetic, and my listing is for a company (Pivotal) with 19 established offices and more that aren't really publicised yet.* The requirement for positions in given locations changes constantly. One month I went through our list and posted those locations. By the end of the month, it was out-of-date.* Then there's the problem that I'm listing for multiple disciplines. Adding an ad for every single role seems like it would be detrimental.* Last but not least: I can earn a referral bonus from the ads I post. I'm not sure how my ad being slurped into a different site helps me, given that I expect my link might not be very prominent. (edit: except you seem to reserve a spot for URLs, so let's drop this one and chalk it up to "Jacques speaks before he reads, episode 20 kajillion")Still, I'd be interested in making it work better.
                      
                  
      Hey xando,Thanks for the awesome website! Could you please add stats for F#? I've seen a few offers using that language but it's not on the Stats page :(Thanks!
                      
                  
      I modified it a tad bit when you're downloading the html job files, (If that's what you're doing):e.g.m = re.match("\s(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s\|\s(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s\|\s(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s\|\s*(?P<attrs>[^|]+?)$)?", "spencertechconsulting.com | web developer | New York | REMOTE, INTERNS")EDIT:You missed the last \| pipe symbol for separating the location group from the attribute group

We create all hardware, software and IT-Infrastructure to run our systems on our own. Beside access systems we are already putting a lot of R&D effort in creating further new smart home/building automation products. We see ourselves as an engineering-driven technology company, that influences how a future with connected devices will look.We enable engineers to focus on what they can to best, letting them work on new products in small, highly interdisciplinary teams. We try to get rid of as much management overhead as possible (no daily standup meetings!).Right now, we are hiring new engineers for the following areas:- RUST Backend Developer- (Frontend) Web Developer- Electrical EngineerWe do not care about your academic degrees or where you are from, but about the stuff you did and what you could create in the future given the right opportunities. If you are interested in working at 1aim, write us an email at work.hn<?>1aim.com and tell us about the projects you worked on that you are the most proud of and which technological feats of the past inspire you. We provide visa assistance, relocation support and free housing until you find your own place to live.Interview process: 1st phone interview (screening) -> 2nd phone interview (technical) -> home assignment/technical challenge (depending on application) -> 3rd interview (mixed, via phone or onsite)Please note that we will be very busy in january due to our presence on an important trade fair and our reply times might be a bit slower.
                      
                  
      "We do not care about your academic degrees [...]"Unfortunately embassies do care about these. Getting a work permit to immigrate to another country without an university degree certainly reduces the chances to get the embassy's approval, even in countries like Germany where there is some flexibility â€” if you have a Senior profile â€” a degree certainly accelerates the process.In fact, in this industry, there is less people caring about an university degree than people who care about it, exceptions being those in the research field. But HR departments always filter out good candidates because they lack the degree, most HR employees are not trained correctly and/or know how difficult it is to hire a foreigner without a formal education background so they immediately throw good resumes to the trash can because of that.
                      
                  
      Just moved to Berlin, no degree. 
The federal employment agency had to give approval after the contract was signed, which took about 2-3 weeks. Working visa issued after 3 days.
HR shouldn't be scared, it's easy and pretty straightforward.
                      
                  
      Could you give a bit more background to this? E.g. moved from where, what is your experience level, salary range maybe?The general advice seems to be that a university degree is almost always required. Having another data point would be helpful!
                      
                  
      You can "replace" the degree with sufficient professional experience, at least for Germany. Ideally you've got several years.
                      
                  
      You are right. It would me much easier for us to require academic degrees. There are still ways to get a work permit for non-EU engineers without a degree, but its much more difficult and subject to a lot of arbitrariness.
In some cases, it required months-long battles and countless appeals with the german federal agencies and thats already with support from the city of berlin. It's a difficult situation for all parties involved and we always warn candidates who might not qualify for an "easy" visa about the implications.Unfortunately, the world is not and has never been a fair and equal place. Most people from western countries do not realize of privileged they are.
                      
                  
      I work for a company called Honeypot. We have placed many non-EU developers with no degrees in jobs in startups in Germany and the Netherlands.If you have no degree, you just need to prove that you have sufficient skills or work experience. It's more paperwork for the company, but for them it's usually worth it.If you want more info, I can ask the team who looks after it.
                      
                  
      In Berlin, so many companies are relocating developers that majority of HR have done the visa thing 4 or 5 times so they're used to it. Also when the job ad says they don't care about your academic degrees that means HR has been informed not to care.
                      
                  
      I don't know why are you getting angry over them. They are not government. Also this point perfectly apply for people from EU.

      It appears you've only managed to hire one person after at least 246 days (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11612805) and it is safe to assume you've advertised this position in other boards as well. I see you were a team of nine developers back then, and only recently became a team of ten developers, according to the job posts.Maybe you should inform the community here why it hasn't been working out for you or update the copy to indicate the level of experience you are looking for.
                      
                  
      It's been a while since I applied, but I haven't heard back yet (no coding exercise either)
                      
                  
      This is great, I do not have so many experiences now, but I will keep close attention at this.

If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything.

As a ground-up rewrite, there's lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we'd love to hear from you.At Scalyr, we've built a log analysis and ops visibility tool that our users rave about, because it smashes expectations for performance and ease of use.

  â€¢ has a wide array of ambitious self-directed projects
  â€¢ has got their hands dirty writing technically complex systems, such as:
    â—¦ a high-performance database/KV store

  â€¢ enjoys writing roughlyâ€“performance-optimal code

  â€¢ has bypassed the Linux kernel (for fun and/or profit)
  â€¢ has written on top of paravirtualisation APIs
  â€¢ enjoys reverse engineering
  â€¢ [insert your own comparable points here]

Our team runs the gamut â€” systems, distributed systems, compilers, professors, famous computer scientists â€” and is well-funded to change the landscape of compute. If intrigued, drop us an email at jobs@hadean.com
                      
                  
      Warning: I had a close friend apply for this position about a year back and it was a bit sketchy. They said remote in the posting and then on the phone said the position was on-site. Additionally they said a salary number on the posting, and then on the phone said a lower number, with a promise to raise salary to the previous number after some amount of time. Then they lowered the number again in a second phone call.
                      
                  
      Sincere apologies to your friend. At that point we were bootstrapping, and had been for a year. We had a fundraise coming together but the amount and timing were at that point unknown, hence lack of specificity regarding salary early on. We have since closed funding so things have been firmed up.As for on-site vs remote we've always been happy to do remote for the right candidate but prefer on-site. We have in the past and continue to have a few remote employees.
                      
                  
      "bootstrapping" is a shitty excuse for changing the salary expectations mid-way through the process.
                      
                  
      From the perspective of a couple of engineer founders who went back and forth between two drastically different termsheets over the course of a few months of negotiations, it was either stick with a figure that relied on a deal we were leaning against, or share the most accurate picture at that point in time. It seems hard to justify acting differently, given the situation.
                      
                  
      Sounds interesting to me!

The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.We currently have a MVP (https://www.senddavid.com) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80Â­-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-Â­4.0% | https://angel.co/david-174/jobs/72943-engineerContact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com

If you look at the extremes, the salary you would get in Luanda, Angola is 1500% more than what you get if you were in Valenzuela, Philippines.
                      
                  
      While I appreciate the transparency, I don't think such large salary differences are reasonable especially with remote work. In the end you compete globally for remote employees and it possible to work remote for SV companies and get somewhat similar salaries than the onsite employees....and of course is living much more expensive in SV but I don't see why that should be "subsidized". No harm in people realizing that it's freaking crazy to pay that much rent.
                      
                  
      Holy hell, you aren't joking. I compared my city with SF in their calculator, and they pay 3,6 times more for someone in SF!That means I can get a $160k rise just by moving to SF! This seems super duper broken.
                      
                  
      You will also spend 3,6 times more money while living in San Francisco.
                      
                  
      The price is that high for a reason: sf has a lot to offer. Networking opportunities, job market liquidity (see all the ONSITE SF posts in this very thread), etc. Perhaps not 3.6 more, but it definitely beats a cabin in the Siberian tundra.By correcting for rent, you give people that advantage for free. That's why it's unfair.
                      
                  
      The way to deal with their unfairness is to refuse to work for them (unless you're in SF!)
                      
                  
      Trust me on that I am working with GitLab from past 6 months and I have never regretted a day. GitLab is always open for ideas and this is also work in progress. How many companies have you seen declaring their compensation framework :)
                      
                  
      Not many, but disclosing compensation isn't worth $100k/yr to me.
                      
                  
      On the bright side, it's seriously awesome that they're so transparent about salaries.
                      
                  
      That really depends on where you live :)
Not so bright, If you are living in a country which has a low rent index.The calculation is really messed up, rent index should be a contributor not a multiplier.
                      
                  
      Hey there! Thanks for the feedback. I'm part of the PeopleOps team at GitLab and we are always looking to improve our comp. calculator. We know it isn't perfect yet and we need feedback from everyone to create the most fair and accurate compensation calculator for everyone. If you want to share your experience and suggestions with me, I'd be happy to chat with you directly and share them with our internal compensation committee. Feel free to email me at sasha@gitlab.com !
                      
                  
      I like that you guys are being open about this, but the way you calculate compensation leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth. I very much dislike the idea that you, as an employer, are deciding what proportion of their income your employees should be spending on rent. You're also effectively saying that work done by someone who lives in a cheaper location is less valuable to the company than the same work done by someone who lives in a more expensive location. Maybe all employers do this and the only difference is that you guys are being honest about it, but still... yuck.
                      
                  
      As someone who works remotely in a company that does take location into account, I can understand their perspective. I think there's a base value for work and then depending on the power of each dollar earned, there are multipliers to that that eventually give you your final salary. So it's "value of work" * location based spending power differences. Value of work stays constant.That said I do think the factors used to calculate the salary can improve. In general, I love the idea of thinking of quality of life. Can a person in Sri Lanka enjoy a similar quality of life as a person in SF at least in terms of factors that can be controlled (a company can't control the quality of public transport or municipalities for example in a given location but can provide me the opportunity to purchase experiences or work around those matters).And that matters because although rent in Sri Lanka is lower than Brisbane, buying groceries is actually more expensive. Buying electronics is certainly more expensive because of the enormous markups and taxes. Compared to a location in the US, I pay nearly triple the value of a given electronics item at times just for the cost of shipping it and then paying customs. Even travel becomes more expensive since I have much more lengthy Visa processes to go through. These numbers eventually add up and while I can save huge amounts of money by living frugally, if I wanted to live a good life supporting my wife and child, the number should be ideally 60k USD and above rather than 38k.Should mention that Software engineers are considered to be some of the lowest level fodder in Sri Lanka and our good salaries can be something like 12-15k per year. Starting salaries would be something ridiculous like 3k USD per year (that was mine). But that's also why so many people are migrating to australia, US, and canada asap if they can.
                      
                  
      Doesn't it bother you that you can provide the same value to your employer as someone in Brisbane, but only get paid a fraction as much for it merely because you're in Sri Lanka?I'm a remote worker too (and I'm very happy with the way my current employer handles it). As long as I'm available at the times and places my employer needs me to be, why should they have any say in where I live or how I spend my money? I want to be able to manage my quality of life myself, not have it decided for me by someone else!
                      
                  
      Well, re the value, I don't feel salary has ever been a great representation of value a person brings to the company. It's decent at a basic level but quickly breaks down as your value grows.But to be honest I feel bothered but about something completely different really. My worry is for the person in Brisbane. I worry that people like myself will be seen as advantageous to hire and if it comes down to a close hire decision between me and someone in Brisbane I wouldn't want to be chosen because I require a lower salary. Gitlab does do this. I don't fault them either for that though. At the end of the day you want to save money. It's a tough conversation really. Quality of life and spending power are real things and value can actually be seen as relative when you look at how much it takes to give people equal opportunities from location to location. But this opens room for abuse and exploitation. I think remote working salaries vs location will be discussed more and more over time because there is definitely many shades of grey towards the "right" path.
                      
                  
      > I very much dislike the idea that you, as an employer, are deciding what proportion of their income your employees should be spending on rent.With rent as a multiplier, it's like they're suggesting 100% of your income goes to rent. It seems like a more reasonable way to take housing into account would be something like:Salary = Base + Avg RentUsing that formula, salary might be about $20k more for somebody in NYC than for somebody in Tucson. Using the actual calculator, it's $72k more ($117k vs $45k for senior level and average experience).
                      
                  
      We found that rent correlates with market rates, see https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/global-c... "Perhaps surprisingly, there was a stronger correlation between compensation and rent index than with the more general cost of living index available through Numbeo (or the cost of living with rent index, for that matter); and so we moved ahead with the Rent Index."
                      
                  
      It might do you well to check up on the pay scales for the mid-size American cities.I live in Minneapolis and the rates offered are laughable, really.  My last apartment was on the border of St Paul, if I had lived a block away your offer would have been about 10% less.It seems to not take into account rent diversity within a city (and which level a skilled employee would pick given the opportunity).GitLab has really gotten my interest over the past year with both trying it myself recently and seeing you interact with folks on HN.  I'm currently searching for a new position but seeing the rates make applying a non-starter.
                      
                  
      We're working on a global compensation framework, to be open and fair about compensation for everyone that works at GitLab. It's described in more detail on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/global-c... . The local rent index (+ a fixed 0.25), NYC benchmark, level, and experience all play in to the compensation. Having the calculator has allowed us to make offers to people in lots of new locations. I'm always looking for ways to keep it robust (i.e. as simple as possible) while being fair as well. If you have specific ideas on how to improve it, please send me an email on ernst@gitlab.com
                      
                  
      If you are really serious about being fair. Ask yourself this question: Why would a guy who can easily get 6K+ USD per month by working on Upwork, Toptal work for Gitlab for 1/3rd of that money and that too Full time?A quick google search will show you that people use 30% of their salary towards their rent: https://www.google.co.in/search?q=rent+as+percentage+of+sala... What does that tell you about computing salaries based off of rent?You can see a lot of people discussing Gitlab's salary in a negative way on HN: https://hn.algolia.com/?query=gitlab%20salary&sort=byPopular... Most of them have fluff responses talking about being open and fair.
                      
                  
      We are serious about being fair :-)Regarding using the rent index; that was a data-driven decision as described on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/global-c... 
but as I mentioned, it is a work-in-progress just like everything else at GitLab always is, and I'm open to alternatives / ideas.
                      
                  
      Why are we bashing GitLab when they're at least taking steps to make their pay public? Every company has some version of this formula, you just can't see how off it is.
                      
                  
      If I ever apply for Gitlabs (which I'm often tempted to do) I'm afraid that my history of conversations on HN will betray my tendency to bring up uncomfortable issues... Oh well... ;-)Maintaining the idea of fairness is often important in the eyes of employees, but I wonder if it's actually a good idea in practice.  Really, you want to hire the best people you can for the money that you've got.  So with the system you have in place, if you have 2 equally skilled people, then there is a pretty big incentive to hire the cheaper one.The end result is likely to be a bit of a skewed culture.    Very skilled people are more rare than less skilled people.  They are hard to hire, so you will tend to hire whoever you can find.  Less skilled people are much easier to hire, so you will find them in almost any geographical location.The end result will be a company where only the best people will be hired in the expensive region, while the inexpensive regions will have a mixed bag.  Because very skilled people are rare, you will end up having inexpensive regions being overwhelmingly represented by lower skill levels (low skill -> easy to hire -> available in any geographic location -> cheaper geographic locations will be hired first)This will create a power imbalance in the company because the highest density of high skilled workers will be geographically close and therefore in the same timezone.  High skilled workers in lower paid regions may have a stigma attached to them because they come from a lower paid region -- and hence are associated with the higher occurrence of lower skilled workers.  This may result in considerable friction over time.I think you can mitigate this problem by creating a second tier pay system for your most skilled workers.  This should be a harmonised pay scale and you should pay attention to trying to evenly distribute positions in this pay scale across geographic boundaries.  To make it obvious which pay scale people are attached to, you can create new titles for the positions.You will still have an "Us vs. Them" problem, but at least it will be people you have consciously decided that you want to promote in the company.  It is explicitly not fair (in that not everybody is equal), but it makes a clear message of how you want the leadership to work.It also makes salary negotiations a bit easier.  Often people aspire to the highest level of compensation, even if their contributions do not warrant it.  When people ask to be promoted to the special pay tier, it creates an opportunity for having a frank discussion about the person's performance.  This can clear the air and set proper expectations -- or possibly indicate clearly to the employee that they aren't as valued as they wish to be.  Even if someone leaves in this circumstance, it can often be to the benefit of all parties.Hope you find this interesting/useful.  It's always a tricky balancing act, so I wish you luck :-)
                      
                  
      We value directness https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#values so I expect us not to hold this against you.I think you make a great point. I do want to add some nuance:1. We currently have great people all around the world. Many of them used to be in expensive locations but moved.2. Because we're remote only the problem of concentration would be time zone only. But for practical purposes South America is a similar time zone as North America.3. We have one career path (junior/intermediate/senior/staff/etc.) that is available to everyone based on performance.Thanks for the comment, it is interesting and I'll share it with our Sr. Director of People Ops.
                      
                  
      Just run a simulation for Belgium, you are way below the average.
                      
                  
      We have recently hired great people in Belgium based on the calculator rates. Of course there is no objective market rate, there are likely people getting paid more and less.
                      
                  
      Most people in far away cheap(-ish) countries (eastern Europe and Asia) can't easily go to upwork/toptal and make 6k+ a month.
                      
                  
      not to mention the stress of doing work on upwork.
                      
                  
      yeap! You face people ghosting all the time and some hoaxes...
                      
                  
      toptal AFAIR tries to assign rates based on location, too.
                      
                  
      In my opinion, "fair" would be paying people doing the same job the same amount of money...
                      
                  
      That's crazy talk. I like Ferraris, should I get paid the same as a Honda-liking person? How am I going to pay for my Ferrari then?
                      
                  
      I live in Valenzuela, Philippines and can attest that the cost of life is very cheap here, I am not surprised that the compensation is lower. What I wonder is what happens if you get hired while working from the Philippines and then move to a more expensive city like New York, or vice-versa. Will GitLab change the salary automatically? Because one could easily create a bank account in the US and live in a cheap country and there is no need to disclose that information.
                      
                  
      If you relocate, then yes, that affects compensation. This is described in more detail on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#relocat...
                      
                  
      Wow, for exactly this reason I now have no interest in applying.  GitLab went from meh to awesome over the last few years but for my city the compensation is just wrong.  I'm not interested in applying to have that fight later (or being paid 20-40k under market)
                      
                  
      Can you please email me at ernst@gitlab.com to let me know what city and role you're looking at?
                      
                  
      What if I travel the world constantly? EU citizen. Last time I was home 1.5 years ago. Currently in Bangkok, Thailand. What my compensation country will be?
                      
                  
      We're still pinning down a definition but if it is for more than a few months we consider it a relocation. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#relocat...

      Hey There! If you've applied with GitLab and the past and asked for feedback, but not received it I'm sincerely sorry. Please feel free to reach out directly to me (sasha@gitlab.com) and I will try to find the details of your interview process and provide feedback.
                      
                  
      Sure :) I'm still curious, although it happened a few months ago, and I got hired since. It's seems kinda unfair though, for the people who never got a message back, because they don't know the right person to ask, or they don't follow hacker news.
                      
                  
      The rent multiplier for Seattle in the salary calculator is really low. :(
                      
                  
      I can't disagree. I love Gitlab but it would be hard to take a > 50% pay cut if I were to work there.That being said, I have full confidence in Gitlab and know they'll continue to improve these things!
                      
                  
      Oakland is almost that low and it's a 10-minute BART ride from downtown SF.  It's ridiculous to have that much differential within a short commute distance, not to mention the variety of neighborhoods even within cities.
                      
                  
      We might make an adjustment for Oakland since it is a fast growing city and market rates there tend to be higher.
                      
                  
      Why do you pay based on rent instead of market rate in the first place?

      Hey There! Thanks for the note! We do wish that field to be mandatory, but we can definitely add "if not please insert N/A" Thanks so much for the heads up on that and glad to see you've applied :D

      hamishtaplin; unfortunately coverage is not fully global yet; I think we have about 372 cities in there at the moment. This draws from Numbeo.com's data set on rent indices. But if your city is not listed, our default solution is the following "If you live outside a metro region we base our offer upon the lowest rent index number of any metro region in your country (or state, in the case of the USA), if your country is listed"

For this position, a significant amount of experience with Ruby is a strict requirement.Perhaps a good idea to add developers(RoR)

      Please spell out 'Oregon'.  You can't search for 'OR'.
                      
                  
      Too late for me to edit my original post but your reply will show up in that search, thanks!
                      
                  
      Yes you can. Entering Portland, OR in Google will usually filter out results for Portland, Maine (at least for the accounts I tested).
                      
                  
      Portland Oregon is not Oregon though.  Perhaps people are interested in what's on offer throughout the state.Doing a simple text search on 'OR' has a zillion false positives.
                      
                  
      No, but the job was in Portland, OR. And if you Google the city you'll find out about the area. Which includes as much Washington State anyway, I wouldn't base my decision of moving to Portland just on the state of Oregon.

      Where in Los Angeles? There is no easily found information regarding the location.
                      
                  
      We're actually still based in San Francisco and working on the relocation right now. We're deciding between Culver City and Downtown.
                      
                  
      Downtown could definitely use more tech-centric companies. Good luck.Once you have decided, definitely list the exact neighborhood with every job ad. Los Angeles is a big place and most do not want to travel to a far off area.
                      
                  
      Will do. If it would be up to me, we would move down to El Segundo or Redondo Beach. But my colleagues are not that excited about those areas. Will see if I can sell them on downtown
                      
                  
      The far majority of the tech companies are on the west side. Most north of LAX, but there are a few in El Segundo, which you probably know already. Culver City is a good halfway point, especially if you want to avoid the expensive westside and the bad commute if you live much eastward. The Expo Line serves Culver City.I personally avoid the westside, so I can see why some of your colleagues would too.
                      
                  
      Appreciate the recommendation. I personally don't care much to be around other startups (although in SF we sit around the corner from Stripe, Soundcloud, ...).I want decent space with good food options around and for my people to afford decent housing close to the office. It seems to be more doable in LA than in SF.
                      
                  
      One plus of being downtown is that people can take the metro to work.
                      
                  
      That's a great point I heard a lot recently

      Amazon New Product Demand Forecasting | Seattle | Full-Time | On-Site ($130-$250+ depending on experience)Amazon's New Product Demand Forecasting team is responsible for one of the most challenging problems in supply chain optimization: predicting sales for products that have no sales history. This is a uniquely creative space in Forecasting requiring our machine learning models to capture both the nuances of the global consumer marketplace as well as customer behavior on Amazon.Our team works closely with research scientists to invent new ways to make use of novel data, solve hard engineering problems around scaling and performance in predicting for tens of millions of products, and iterate quickly in order to stay on the cutting edge.
I'm looking for an experienced software developer that is comfortable with big data and machine learning and can:* Design systems that provide a stable base for innovation in a rapidly changing business* Improve Forecasting algorithms through data-driven analysis and experimentation in our Scala/Spark environment* Optimize for scalability and performance of both distributed computations and near-metal C++ code* Learn quickly and keep up with a rapidly changing machine learning and big data landscape* Communicate their ideas clearly with all members of a diverse teamIf this sounds interesting, as the hiring manager I'd love to chat or buy you coffee. Email me (Stefan) at smai@ (amazon.com) with your resume and a brief introduction. (Interview process is 1 phone screen and onsite interview with whiteboard coding and behavioral questions about your experience.)
                      
                  
      Some guy called 'Robert DesRosiers ' from amazon restaurants contacted me on linkedin, made me take bunch of online tests and then dropped off face of the planet. His linkedin now says he is at Nordstrom, not sure if it was some sort of scam or if he got fired.I now believe all the horror stories about amazon treating poeple like cattle.
                      
                  
      Same experience a few years back with another vertical (video, as I recall), so it's not just you.I later went through the process far enough to get offers from AWS and Alexa and ... meh. Went with the Other Guys.  Seattle is full of people who moved here for Amazon, burned out in 18+- months, and left for other orgs.  YMMV, as with any BigCo, but some caution is advised.
                      
                  
      I'm really sorry about that. If you send me an email with your name and contact information, I can look into what happened.Every day I work with incredibly smart, driven, and talented engineers. Treating such valuable individuals "like cattle" is absurd - I go to bat for the engineers on my team every single day I'm at work.
                      
                  
      Yes, well, the behavior noted here was toward people who weren't on anyone's team, were they?That said, hiring well is really hard, especially setting the compensation structure to avoid creating perverse incentives which can result in issues just like these.Tangentially, as a general rule (below the executive level), external recruiters < in-house recruiters < team members < hiring managers. On average anyway, as there are plenty of individual exceptions either way.
                      
                  
      >  amazon treating poeple like cattleDid a day onsite with Amazon, didn't get the position, asked to reapply later... and within 2 months same e-mail address is hit by 6-7 unique Amazon recruiters. Many for the same hiring event.Desperate, or dysfunctional? Who knows.

Phaxio is a simple, yet powerful, faxing API (you heard that right, faxing). We power small companies from places like YC and Techstars to major banks and Fortune 100 companies.Who we're looking for:
As a full stack developer at Phaxio, you will be working with a variety of technologies on the front and back end.  We recently rewrote our API in Rails and just rolled out a whole new look and feel.On an average day you might find yourself:
- Updating chef recipes to deploy a new service- Working to add a new feature to our Rails web dashboard or the flagship API- Tweaking our packer or vagrant development setup to optimize dev time for other engineers- Using Wireshark to diagnose issues with one of our carriers- Improving fabric scripts we use to automate our infrastructure on AWS- Answering a technical support ticket that involves a feature you created- Work on an open source library that helps developers or even non-technical end-users integrate with PhaxioFor interviews:
After a brief conversation to make sure that we're all on the same page, we'll send over an interesting issue for you to diagnose and solve. Nobody looking over your shoulder or breathing down your neck :)If you're interested, send an email to howard at Phaxio.com
                      
                  
      Why US only? Is it a timezone issue?
                      
                  
      Most companies with remote workers and additional restrictions for their nationality do it because of taxes and other legal stuff. Some times it is financial departments being lazy, other times is because the company wants to offer extra benefits to their employees that are only possible if they live in the same country where the organization was registered.
                      
                  
      This isn't true of every position at Phaxio as we do have some team members outside the country. This position however, requires someone who resides in the US.If you're interested at working with Phaxio, drop me note!
