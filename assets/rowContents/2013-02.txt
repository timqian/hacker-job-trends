SFBA, NYC, ChicagoMatasano is always hiring application security people, and I'm always happy to talk to systems developers who'd like to do more appsec and software security. We're like the antistartup job: instead of sinking 1-2 years of your time into building a single product built on a single stack, you work with hundreds of firms unbuilding systems running on practically every stack.http://www.matasano.com/careers/ goes into a lot of detail about our hiring process, which people seem to like.I'll be out in Mountain View next week if you're interested in what we do and might want coffee.Special offer: if you're wondering what the day-to-day of our work is and want to learn some interesting things about breaking crypto, mail "sean" at Matasano and Sean will send you a series of cryptographic exercises, 40+ in total, ranging from CS101 stuff through block cipher attacks to number theoretic crypto.
                      
                  
      no remote? :(
                      
                  
      I'd probably move to work at Matasano if they thought I had something to offer.  Getting my wife to move is another story!

      Hi Paul, JTLYK your website with JS off won't load.
                      
                  
      Indeed it won't. We rely pretty heavily on JS, in particular for real-time updates to builds, and so the entire front-end is one big JS app.That said, we should add some text to at least pitch people to whitelist us, but it hasn't been that high a priority just yet.

      Factual is currently hiring engineers and data lovers of all levels in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai.
Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US ('exceptional' meaning you are a great engineer and have lots of machine learning/data extraction/NLP/etc. experience that is relevant to what we do).Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:Palo Alto Software Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Software engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Data Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews

      Transcriptic: Core DeveloperMenlo Park, CATranscriptic is the "Amazon Web Services" for life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development. Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.We're a very small startup (you'd be #4), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.max at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/

      I'd be interested to hear why you've created a separate "devops" position in addition to the linux engineer.  Do you actually have a separate team you call "devops"?  If so, how does this relate to the concepts of DevOps other than in name?

      VividCortex, Inc.Charlottesville, VA (Remote, Fulltime)We're building database administration tools delivered as a service. We're early-stage, pseudo-stealth, but with great momentum and access to the market, and we're well funded. It's a pretty unique company and market, and it's tackling a legitimate problem in the devops/sysadmin world. Our jobs:Dev/ops: our backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (itâ€™s awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is "we need another backend/infrastructure engineer."Frontend: the web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP and the stuff that runs in the browser, and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.Head of UX/UI: your impact would be immediate as we already have leading consumer web companies using our technology. Your impact would also be lasting because there really isnâ€™t anything in this space, and, if you can lead the defining efforts of UX/UI for system administration, then you will have moved the industry forward. 
Ideally, you know Photoshop, have worked with front-end development teams and know a little bit about system administration. Additionally, we work with a lot of charts and graphs, and notification feeds. Other than that, we are open to a variety of experiences.As an early-stage company, we offer the chance to end up owning a fair chunk of what we believe is likely to be a very valuable business.Email jobs@vividcortex.com

      Notting Hill, London, England.Our web application is at the heart of our busy e-commerce business; every day it serves millions of product images and handles thousands of purchases - but we can and do update the live site with new code anytime we want without missing a beat. Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalising specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 80 employees and a substantial annual turnover. The firm is growing quickly after a recent investment round.

  | Redwood City, CA - UI Engineer |
  +--------------------------------+

Tidemark Systems (http://www.tidemark.net, note ".net") is hiring.Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem. For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.

I'm a developer there currently working on infrastructure tasks and relocated over there about three years ago, and have been very happy with it.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and a few CPAN modules.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers.
You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a few times before andI've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent

      MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns (specifically college students looking for summer internships) and H1Bs welcomeMokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into "layers", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)See mokafive.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!I'll be in Cambridge and Pittsburgh next week for the MIT and CMU career fairs, with time to chat with interested folks in those two cities.

          Startup - Sequoia Waste Solutions (Pittsburgh, PA) 

    Full Time or Contract. Remote OK, Local Preferred.

    Positive-Cash Flow with 8 full time employees + contractors, interns

We are a 1.5 yr old startup working to disrupt the $60 billion waste industry, and we are primarily looking for a backend & systems developer. We need individuals who are willing to solve problems inherent to an aging industry, and by doing so, topple the biggest players in the market.    About the company: 

Sequoia is saving businesses money by incentivizing them to recycle. We work with almost any sized business to make recycling and waste-vendor management simple.We have hundreds of client locations in a dozen states, and are cash flow positive with reoccurring monthly revenue, but need to stay on top of our tech development to stay ahead of the multi-billion dollar players in the space.You will be an integral part of a small development team, tasked with improving upon 1-2 years of database, iOS, and customer portal/CRM development.Currently we are rebuilding our backend, taking into consideration all the lessons of our first year and a half with clients. After doing so, we'll be prepared to roll out service in nearly every metro-area around the country - scaling on what will be your product!    <-- Requirements/Responsibilties -->

Leadership experience, with the ability to produce from conception to execution.
Comfortable architecting 'behind the scenes' systems, and building those systems in a manner suitable for scale.
A keen eye for customer UX.Preferably, you have a cool project, website, or demo that you could send in.We've done a majority of development for iOS, and run our data services on Salesforce and an AWS RDS instance. We're looking to get away from Salesforce as the backend to our customer portal and develop our own, pulling data from our own database.    <-- What we will be working on -->

Collecting more data streams, via government agencies and any available API's, so that we may better analyze our customer's services.
Further down the road, we will make trash receptacles 'smart' for data collection and customer service.    <-- To apply -->

      deviantART (http://www.deviantart.com/) is looking for a DevOps Engineer. We're based in Los Angeles, but looking to hire someone remote.It's a LAMP site, but in Ops we use a mix of PHP, Ruby, and Python. For configuration management we use Puppet.You can find more details at http://deviantart.jobs/
                      
                  
      I'm a bit surprised that deviantart has chosen to call the position a "devops" engineer on the "devops" team when what you're really looking for is a system engineer on your ops team.  Does that concern any of the "devops" engineers that the management doesn't understand what devops is?

      EasyESI (http://easyesi.com) - Berkeley, CA (SFBA) - full-time, US residents onlyEasyESI is 7-person, tech-led startup that helps lawyers sift through mountains of evidence in a case to find the smoking gun. This is a good business to be in: the amount of data is only increasing, lawyers are willing to pay for better solutions, and we're good at applying cutting-edge CS to traditionally hard problems. As a result, we're cash-flow positive less than two years after our founding, and growing rapidly.We have many challenging problems, including machine learning, visualization, search, and nifty user interfaces. We're looking for generalists; we'll teach you (or you'll teach yourself) what you need to know.We're a fun company, with an awesome location in downtown Berkeley, foosball, game nights, and more. We'll offer you a great salary, equity, health care, retirement with company matching, and a generous vacation schedule.We are looking to fill 3 positions:Front-End/UI Engineer - Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.Software Engineer - We all wear many hats, contributing to a backend Java codebase that uses minimal XML. We use a lot of modern open source technologies: Lucene, Cassandra, AWS, etc. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We have our own 48-drive-bay fileserver to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust. We're happy to hire someone with solid fundamentals who wants to learn on the job.We consider all applicants; please apply for the position(s) you're interested in at http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml.
