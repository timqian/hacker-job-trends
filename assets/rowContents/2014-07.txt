Weft - http://weft.io - Cambridge/Boston, MA (office is in central sq.)   ===========================
   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================

Strategic Maritime Risk Planning (waze for ships, https://www.waze.com/)! Weâ€™re working in the largest, least sexy, most invisible industry in the world â€” 90% of everything has been on a ship at one point in time.The problem -> To try to decrease costs, carries have been increasing the size of container ships. The only problem there is that as container ships get larger, the variability in the global supply chain goes up (e.g. a large ship being late causes a headache to more people than a small one).How we fix it -> We track every ship on the water and run a bunch of analysis on our data sets so that we can help our customers smooth out the rough edges. (One company we're working with spends 6.5 mil every month on â€œlate feesâ€� because of these rough edges).   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================

Web/data stack -> clojure + postgres/cassandra/redis/rabbit + ruby on rails + hadoop/EMR + node (weâ€™re a SOA shop)Mobile -> iOS, android in the near termAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors (a16z)!Looking for help on mobile, frontend, and data science sides! Would be thrilled to find a CTO to grow the tech side of the company with me, but I'm also happy to find engineers who just want to build great things.If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!

      Bloomberg - San Francisco (full-time, no remote, no relo, visa ok)I am looking for the first few individuals to join a team of two building something special in SF. Bootstrapping a team from scratch requires a type of person who thrives in a startup atmosphere and can wear many hats. Ideal candidates have had plenty of experience scaling up or building large distributed systems and/or building products for developers with a large user base. Full-time Bloomberg LP employment with generous benefits and compensation commensurate with experience.Who we are:We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion "ticks" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one "feed") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, machine translation, etc. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, Government, Law, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.If you want to join a team in the single digits and work for one of the most profitable software companies in the world, contact me -- andrew@ishiboo.com (personal e-mail)
                      
                  
      If Andrew Paprocki says a particular role at BB is interesting, it's probably amazing.

I see many possible matches in the US-based jobs. Is there an option for a broader application where you would suggest a good match?Would it be possible to perform some of the roles offered for US in continental Europe or truly remotely?
                      
                  
      Are all of IBM's operations at the Watson center in Yorktown Heights moving to Manhattan or are these really two separate groups? I ask as someone who is interested in applying.
                      
                  
      These are two separate groups - Watson Group will have presence in both Manhattan (HQ) and Yorktown Heights

      "Given that the Gnome foundation ran out of money because they diverted donations to women's outreach, rather than focusing on the core mission of programming"This is, shockingly, incorrect:1) The GNOME Foundation did not run out of money.
2) The reason for the financial issues was not that money from donations was diverted to women's outreach - instead, corporate donations that were intended specifically for OPW were not received before outgoings to students were due. Money from existing reserves was used to cover the shortfall, most of which has now been made up as the original donations have been received.
3) The GNOME Foundation's charter does not define a core mission of programming. One of its roles is to promote development of the GNOME platform, and recruiting developers from a pool that's been largely ignored by the free software community is an excellent way to do that.That's three fundamental factual errors in 25 words.
                      
                  
      Running out of money would imply that there was, well, no money. Which was never the case. The Foundation has significant cash reserves, as you can easily verify from looking at its public accounts.The outreach program has resulted in a significant increase in the number of developers working on the GNOME project, which improves their ability to build the GNOME platform. The charter doesn't say that they'll sponsor developer travel to conferences either, or the purchase of hardware in order to improve integration. Why are you hung up on a specific example of spending money in a way that improves the project, but not any others?
                      
                  
      Employment law only covers so much. For one, people are still discriminated against on the basis of their belonging to a protected class - it just can't be done overtly. For another the laws don't cover everything.I appreciate that you feel the phrasing is antagonistic; but I hope you can appreciate that to me it is deeply reassuring and gives me much needed hope.Searching for employment for me is very stressful (as it is for most people I imagine). I'm non-typical in a few ways, and some of them are rather visible. I have to worry about and have experienced judgment/reluctance to hire me based on those differences. It is nice for me to know ahead of time that an employer is not just looking for people who fit a certain mold.It's not just about women, LGBTQ, people of color, etc either. One of the ways I am somewhat non-typical as a developer is I'm a high school dropout. It's relatively common for developers not to have a college/university education, but overall it's still not the norm and there are places that will discount you on that basis (especially outside the major tech hubs). Sure, a lot of postings will add that nice qualifier "or equivalent experience"; and that's great. This goes a little farther though, and lets me know that not only will they not hold my lack of a piece of paper against me, they won't hold my alternate path in life against me either.I can appreciate that it might seem like it goes without saying to you, or might ring hollow... but honestly I've found there are places that don't care about diversity/inclusiveness, or are even hostile to it. Also, I do actually appreciate just the effort of hanging that little sign that says "this is a welcoming place".
                      
                  
      This is totally inappropriate here - take it somewhere else.  I see no problem with them saying that being inclusive is something they care about...
                      
                  
      Dear Darth Google,We do not believe that our commitment to equality, inclusivity, and diversity constitutes a "politically charged environment".Nevertheless, please feel free to not apply to this job if you worry that your politics would not be a good fit with the culture at npm.I remain hopeful that we will manage to survive without your valuable contribution.Thanks.--Isaac Z. Schlueter, President and CEO, npm, Inc.
                      
                  
      I remain hopeful that we will manage to survive without your valuable contribution.Isaac, you are my new hero. Seriously.
                      
                  
      Since when was "we want our employees to respect one another and not harass each other" considered "political beliefs"? Fuck off with your childish manbaby bullshit nonsense shitgarbage. Get the fuck out of our industry if that's how you're going to act. You have the emotional maturity of a walnut.You know what? Don't even bother responding. You're gonna think you're clever, but you'll actually be responding with trite garbage that we've all heard, literally, hundreds of times before. People like you are climate change deniers, or creationists. You have tons of information and resources right in front of you, but you never bother to pay attention. Then suddenly you're the idiot asking why monkeys still existed if humans evolved from them.
                      
                  
      If the dudebro frat brogrammer scene is the "software industry" you're trying to keep from being "ruined", then I say we ruin it as fast as possible.And yes, Brandon Eich got run out of town because of his political beliefs. They ran contrary to the stated beliefs of the organization he was going to run. When you're the CEO of something as public as the Mozilla Foundation those sort of things will be scrutinized. If he was just running Brandon Eich Consulting, LLC no one would have thought twice about it.
                      
                  
      Thanks for your support for us white cis men. I don't know where we would be without your bravery and courage. /sAs a gay guy, I congratulate you in your inclusiveness, npm. I'm not interested in working on front-end at the moment, but if I were you would have gotten my attention. Thank you.
                      
                  
      Thank god we have people like Darth Google looking out for the white guys.
                      
                  
      Because discrimination is funny if it's against white males!
                      
                  
      Khan Academy â€” Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)We're a small, non-profit tech startup bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.Here's a testimonial we received last wweek:==================================I just want to thank you soooo very much in high school it was very hard for me and I hated studying also even thou my mother told me it would help me I never listened and now I am in college and this website helps me so much with algebra/health and so much more when I start working again I want to give back to you for helping me out in college and becoming a Doctor because you can never say never :)==================================Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.You'll be part of a small team working alongside both "celebrity" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.We're especially looking for new product designers (of all types) but we also have many engineering positions open as well as some positions for a teacher and contract question writers.Apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers and mention that you're coming from HN. Feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org if you have questions about applying or about KA in general. Unfortunately we can't sponsor visas right now unless you're from Canada, Australia, or Mexico.
                      
                  
      Don't take me wrong, I really appreciate Khan and I've learned quite a bit from his videos, but I am not seeing the technical challenges in running the website. My opinion is the challenge with Khan's academy is not a technical one, but how to scale the teachers/presenters. Khan is a great teacher, very knowledgable and engaging, but how do you find people like him to take over the other subjects.
                      
                  
      A few things we're currently working on building:â€“ The next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the UI more consistent across subjects and to help people learn betterâ€“ Improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don't know [2]â€“ Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [3]â€“ A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)â€“ Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [4]There's a ton more that we want to do but haven't had a chance to even think about yet. Not all of our work is technically interesting, but a lot of it is, and it's easy to find technical challenges if that's what you're looking for.(As for new content, we're working on partnerships with other organizations [5][6] and have many new content creators in other subjects [7]. We're obviously working hard to find ways to make more great content.)[1]: https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/58354379257/intr...[2]: http://mattfaus.com/2014/05/improving-khan-academys-student-...[3]: https://github.com/Khan/perseus[4]: https://twitter.com/soprano/status/474729636710985728[5]: https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/90372763660/new-...[6]: https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/65072185996/khan...[7]: https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/89105955375/more...
                      
                  
      Another example of something technically cool that we built recently is tinyquery, a pure-Python reimplementation of Google BigQuery suitable for very small data sets, which we're using for (fast) integration testing when building pipelines on top of the BigQuery API:https://github.com/Khan/tinyquery

      Lovely, San Francisco: http://livelovely.com. Looking for smart, relatively senior devs and designers. No remote, but we'll pay relocation expenses if you're not local and we've sponsored two H1Bs so far.We're the prettiest entrant in a traditionally un-pretty industry: real estate. This is an entrenched industry that is overdue for some innovation, and it's a great opportunity to work on improving the difficult experience of finding a home. Your rent payment is probably the biggest bill you pay every month.It's a great time to join because we've recently hit an inflection point, especially in SF where it's hard to find an apartment. We're on Lifehacker regularly, featured in last month's WIRED magazine, and 7x7 named us one of the top startups changing the world.We're just over 20 people right now but we're growing as fast as we can find people. We just signed a lease for our first office by ourselves, a gorgeous 6000sqft building.
I run engineering -- ex-YC, Django dev, been in the real estate space most of my life. I'd be happy to answer any of your questions: zain@livelovely.com.
                      
                  
      Two questions:
1 Do you support anywhere outside of SF?
2 Do you support someone without a credit score?I ask because I think the product you have is sorely lacking in many, many areas, and is a great idea!
And I ask about the credit score as growing numbers of people are ditching credit cards and other forms of loans in favor of good ol' cash and checks.

Hall sounds like a great company to work for.I am an experienced software developer looking for opportunities in the Bay area. I am currently working at Qualcomm- Modem software division. At this point in my career, I really want to break into the mobile / web development, but it has proven not easy- given that my experience is primarily with firmware / embedded device programming.I do, however,  have a strong foundation in CS fundamentals: algorithms, data structures, good coding practices. I also have a lot of experience in all aspects of the software development life cycle (requirements, design, implementation and testing), having implemented and maintained high-quality software that are deployed on billions of mobile devices around the world.I have taken initiatives on my own to learn about web and mobile development. Last summer, I took Startup Engineering class on Coursera which taught front-end and back-end technologies, built a website on my own in a month (~10,000 lines of code), earned a place in the final projects rankings, and a distinction for passing the class at 97% grade. I am also signing up for Android programming class on the same platform.I am an extremely fast learner and am eager to learn whatever necessary, including new languages and technologies, to get the jobs done.Please let me know if you are interested. You can reach me at 858-405-8831 or hugh.hn@gmail.com

      Numerate Inc, San Bruno, CA (25 mins from San Francisco)Senior Infrastructure Engineer - Distributed Systemshttps://github.com/Numerate/hiring--- Who we are ---Numerate is a group of cutting-edge scientists and engineers trying to solve very difficult problems at the interface of medicinal chemistry, data science, machine learning and cloud-scale analytics. We have developed a computational platform that can predict how a potential drug will behave in the lab and the body. We use this platform to process large spaces of chemistry while searching for therapies for some of the worldâ€™s most important diseases, such as, obesity, heart failure, Alzheimerâ€™s, and Huntingtonâ€™s disease. Our platform makes the drug development process cheaper, faster, and results in higher success rates than traditional approaches.--- Our Stack ---Our stack consists of a proprietary distributed computational platform, Numatix, which in-turn consists of cloud management, job management, job execution engine and custom dataflow language layers. We generally run this on top of Amazon Web Services, where we often scale the system to more than 10,000 cores. We are working to scale it to over 100,000 cores. On top of Numatix we run a number of custom libraries and services, such as machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, mathematics, etc. At the very top of our stack sits a number of user-facing tools, including web-based GUIs, NIX command line tools, and custom plugins for third party data analysis and chemistry tools. All of the layers use various storage types (MySQL, S3, Couchbase, custom built). The code base is written in Java, Scala, Python, and some C++. All of these layers are being actively developed and improved.Join us, and code for more than just clicks!For more information see https://github.com/Numerate/hiring or shoot us an email to eng_job@numerate.com

      Ruby Developer  | Charlie (an early-stage, funded startup) | Chicago, ILWe're looking for a developer who's sort of a bad-ass. Can you think up mind-blowing solutions to complex, hairy problems? Do you get excited by things like graph databases and machine learning? We want someone who can move fast, think creatively, and deliver quality/tested code. Is this you?  Have at least a couple years of professional experience writing code.  Take a small risk and join us in building a growth business.Who are we?

Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?).  CNBC called us â€œOne of the worldâ€™s most promising new companiesâ€� and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.Weâ€™ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm.  We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval.  We thoroughly test our code, though weâ€™re not strict TDD.  We're a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company thatâ€™s making moves.Interested?  Find out more here:

      Transcriptic: Full-stack developer (emphasis on frontend)Menlo Park, CATranscriptic is "Amazon Web Services" for the life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.We're a rapidly growing startup (you'd be #18), but well funded ($6M) and have customers at places like Harvard, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.Recent coverage:- http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcript...- http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4...team at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/
                      
                  
      This sounds like it could be a really good fit for me.  My undergraduate degree is in biology, I've got an MS is bioinformatics and I'm currently working on my PhD while being a full-time director/lead developer of the IT group in a division of biomedical informatics at a academic health center.I wasn't actively seeking out employment, but I think I'll apply for this.  Thanks!

This includes full-stack, front-end, back-end, and mobile engineers. Join our team, come in at the ground level, and shape a product that has great potential to transform a huge market!Our tech stack is HTML5, iOS, Android, Go, App Engine, and AWS.Cars are the largest retail vertical in the US â€“ consumers buy almost 50 million new and used cars every year, totaling $1 trillion in value. Yet technology has barely touched the market. Americans buy cars in the same, burdensome ways they did decades ago.

Our goal is to create a delightful experience for every person buying and selling a car, similar to Teslaâ€™s customer service.Shift is extremely well-funded (with a seed round as large as many A rounds), has strong partnerships with key strategic players across the value chain of the car buying process, and has done dozens of sales in San Francisco. We are lean and hypotheses-driven, led by engineering and design. We work hard together, have fun together, and strive to ensure a healthy and respectful culture.talent@shiftcars.com

You will be a manager with a team size of one - you. You will need to pick the next problem on the way to achieve our goals and solve it. You could be working on our custom OS twiddling GPIOs or you could be hacking on the backend or polishing off our iOS app. You will need to hold a lot of complexity in your head and have solid CS fundamentals. For what we do, Google may not have all the answers to your questions, github may not have any such sample code and Stackoverflow may have a vaguely related question with no replies, but you will be responsible for solving the problem.Team: ex-(Apple, Facebook, Google, Jawbone, Lab126, NASA, Samsung). Approximately 1/3rd of the team are PhDs (or PhDs on â€œpauseâ€�) in various fields (Math, Physics, CS) from MIT, Stanford, CMU etc.Along with incredibly smart engineers we are also looking for a world class Product Manager who can work with the incredibly smart engineers while also being laser sharp focused on execution.Drop us an email at stdin@nod-labs.com
                      
                  
      Rinse - San Francisco, CA https://www.rinse.comAlthough the domain isn't sexy at first glance, Laundry and Dry Cleaning really are problems that would benefit from today's technical prowess. Modernizing laundry has real environmental benefits to water usage, not to mention the convenience factor of a delivery service. As humanity becomes more and more urban and less and less likely to have space for a personal washer and dryer, demand for efficient laundry service is growing.Rinse needs to tackle interesting technical challenges as well. Of course, the routing problem as popularized by the Traveling Salesman Problem (except with multiple, load-balanced agents) is a challenge, but since we are also taking photos of the clothes we process, there are interesting data mining, machine learning, and image processing applications as well. This is in addition to the joys of rapidly scaling an operational system, while continually optimizing a consumer-facing product.We're looking for skilled developers of all types to join us, including Web Developers and Full-Stack Developers. Since we haven't taken any VC yet, this is a chance to earn a significant equity stake (while still earning a competitive salary).We're a Python - Django - Heroku - AWS - Postgres -  Backbone.js - Sass - HAML - HTML5 shop currently, but since we're small, there are opportunities to steer us technically as well.More information at https://www.rinse.com/careers/ or just contact us at jobs@rinse.com

      Acquia is hiring for a variety of DevOps roles - Boston, MAAcquia Cloud is a platform as a service tuned to run some of the largest websites on the planet.  Although we're focused on Drupal (essentially the largest open source project in the world) on the cloud team we utilize a variety of languages and operate a polyglot PaaS engineered for enterprise needs.We're one of Amazon's largest customers and run over 8000 AWS instances.  Do you want to not just do DevOps but instead join a team devoted to DevOps at massive scale?  If so let me know!Acquia, itself, was named the fastest growing private company in America last year.We have openings for junior and senior DevOps engineers, distributed systems engineers, systems administrators, low-level developers (C modules, Kernel engineers, etc.) and more.We utilize a variety of languages and technology, including: Ruby, Puppet, MySQL, Cassandra, Python, Go and more!Let me know if you want to work on exciting DevOps project at ludicrous scale such as:  * Architecting highly scalable and resilient PaaS services using technologies such as Docker

      Andrew didn't ask, but I thought I'd just add my 2 cents:I've been at Acquia for a few years and it's a fun place to be. 
Running a system on such a large scale is one of the coolest things I've done in my career so far and there is something new and interesting happening every day.Something that is appealing (at least to me), is that the team is running a very "professional" process.  
All of the commits are code reviewed and have passing tests, the colleagues are all great and impressively capable engineers. Everybody is excited about adding things like code metrics, good refactorings and helpful tooling (travis ci, ...). Even though it's a somewhat "streamlined" process, there is still enough time to fix those annoying little things (Upgrading the Ruby version we use, restructure our puppet manifests for logical consistency, ...).It's a great place to learn and work in a team that actually lives the whole DevOps idea.Andrew (syrneus) is an Engineer and understands the problems that business requirements can have with the current way we're doing things.Ok, enough now before the marketing department tries to get me to write a blog post ;)

San Francisco, CA.Software Engineers: Full-stack, Mobile, DevOpsYesterday we were featured in SFGate with pictures of the apartment we were working out of but, as of today, we have a beautiful new office on 9th Street, South of Mission.A vibrant community of artists and musicians are already using the site and it continues to grow. We just closed our Series A round. We're in that moment of transition where the site has stopped being a project written by two enthusiastic roommates and becomes a real company.

      Silent Circle - SoCal would be cool, but we're spread from California to Greece, so (REMOTE) location is not critical for the right person.We're looking for a web frontend developer with strong UI/UX skills and experience developing usable, attractive, and responsive interfaces. We're not overly concerned with the frameworks or libraries you've used, but hopefully you've been around the block enough times to have solid opinions about a couple.If you're looking for interesting challenges, we have many of them... Delivering high quality products that solve real world problems for our users, while keeping their privacy and security our primary concern, can make for surprisingly competing interests at time. We're a very distributed team, which has many advantages, but also presents a number of challenges; it's pretty critical that you are comfortable working independently.If you're interested in learning more, feel free to reach out to me or StavrosK (We're josh and stavros at silentcircle.com, respectively).

      London, UKFully funded PhD Studentship in Space Debris Environment Modelling using Spatio-Temporal AnalysisUniversity College London=============Although largely unrecognised by the general population, the world has never been more reliant on access to space. However, continued use of the space environment over the last 60 years has polluted the orbits around the Earth with debris. Currently only a small fraction of space debris is tracked. Failure to capture this data more accurately, and model its behaviour, could result in us losing access to space entirely if a space debris cascade event is allowed to occur.The aim of this PhD project is to describe the current space debris environment using cutting edge astrodynamics methods and model its evolution over time using machine learning techniques and spatio-temporal data analysis. The Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL) has become a world leader in accurately modelling the many forces acting on spacecraft in orbit. Our models are currently employed by both NASA and ESA to supply data to support scientific environmental monitoring missions (JASON-1, SENTINEL). SpaceTimeLab have a wealth of experience in the analysis, modelling, simulation and visualisation of large spatio-temporal datasets, with applications in transportation, crime and disaster response. This is an exciting opportunity to build on these models and develop novel techniques to gain new insights into the behaviour of the space debris environment.Skills you will learn include design, development and testing of algorithms, software and database development, experimental design and implementation, data analysis and both technical and interpersonal communication. You will also have the opportunity to build a network of contacts within both the astrodynamics and spatio-temporal data analysis communities.This project is a collaboration between UCLâ€™s Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory and SpaceTimeLab and will be supervised by Dr Stuart Grey and Dr James Haworth.Eligibility: Applications are invited from UK and EU members, residing in UK.Application Procedure: Applicants should send a covering letter and CV to s.grey@ucl.ac.ukStart Date: The post will be available from September 2014Duration: 4 YearsFunding: The scholarship covers UCL registration fees and provides a stipend of Â£15,726 per annum tax free. Travel expenses and research equipment will also be paid for.Funding Body:EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)

Clever (YC S12 - https://clever.com) is building the data platform needed for great software to make its way into the classroom. Just like Stripe has made it simple for developers to build payment processing into their apps, Clever has made it easy for developers to build applications for schools using student data.We're a small, highly technical team with deep experience in education. In under two years, 1 in 7 schools in America has begun using our APIs, meaning that Clever moves data for eight million students every day.Our newest project is essentially Facebook Connect for education: one identity to tie together all of a studentâ€™s learning applications into a cohesive experience.  Weâ€™re making that happen with our Instant Login service, which allows students to log in once and immediately get access to all their apps: https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-05-14-no-more-passwords-cleve...And while we have all the startup perks (a beautiful loft office in SoMa, free lunch, unlimited Amazon credits for learning..) â€“ hands down the best part of the job are the calls and emails from schools describing how much Clever helps them.As an education company, weâ€™re all about learning personally too â€“ itâ€™s practically a prerequisite to work here. In the past few weeks weâ€™ve done tech talks on things like exoplanets, set theory, and kitesurfing.  (We also love a good round of bughouse chess â€“ just ask Magnus Carlsen http://screencast.com/t/xD7umWfo)Weâ€™re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, weâ€™re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  If youâ€™re interested, weâ€™d love to hear from you.https://clever.com/about/jobsAt Clever, we want to work with the best people - applicants of all backgrounds and beliefs are welcome to come improve education with us.
