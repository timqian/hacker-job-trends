      LaterPay - Munich, Germany - remote and relocation help possibleDjango Developer, Python DeveloperLaterPay is a startup looking to change the way we pay for content online. The idea is micropayments, but the twist is that you pay after you accumulate â‚¬5, rather than paying into a 'wallet' up front.We have a couple of positions open for python developers, and as we are still very small, those positions have a lot of scope for responsibility and choosing your own focus. We have a lot of Django work, so there's also a possibility to join as a Django specialist, especially if you also grok HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Other technologies we use include Tornado, Cassandra, Redis, and our code lives on github. Experience with these is a bonus but not necessary!If you are interested, drop us an email with a resume and some code to look at - jobs@laterpay.net
                      
                  
      MongoHQ (SF Bay, remote doable)We do database operations and hosting, and just closed our A-round. We're hiring to solve a lot of different problems, but especially looking for help with:Backend engineering - If your ideal work day involves building software to run across hundreds of systems and care about databases, you are someone we want to talk to. We have everything from server level monitoring/control agents to protocol proxies to backend metrics systems that need love.Operations/devops - If you have used chef/puppet or similar, get irritated about "snowflakes" (one off servers), and have a sometimes irrational desire to automate everything, you are someone we want to talk to. We are one of the companies where operations is the product, so work on the backend systems will often make its way in front of users.[Whatever you do well] - If you have some combination of skills that you think we need, let us know why we should be thinking about them.----------------------------------------------Our tech "stack" is largely node.js/Ruby/Mongo/Redis and we've experimented with Go/Erlang/(other databases). We generally believe in using the right tool for a give job. If you want to  tackle a particular problem with OCaml, for instance, you probably won't face much friction.We have an office right next to the Caltrain in San Mateo (15 mi south of SF) and are willing to let people work remotely if they desire. We will also cover relocation for good people. Our priority is "people who get things done, sometimes in anger" and almost everything else is negotiable.If you're interested, email hello@mongohq.com and ask us some questions (or tell us a story). If you want to talk to me directly, mrkurt@gmail.com

      Hubbub - London or Remote - Full timeHubbub is saving independent food shops by letting people order online when they can't get to the shops themselves. We mask the complexity of ordering from lots of separate shops and allow customers to place a single order online and receive all their weekly shopping in one go. It's good for the shops because it lets them reach a wider audience, and it's good for our busy customers because it allows them to support their local community.We're looking for two developers, who will double the size of our current team, to work on our Rails based website and supporting applications. Ruby experience is a plus, but we're very happy to take on people without direct experience if they know how to learn - our second developer hadn't written any Ruby before starting with us.More details, including how to apply, are at http://apply.hubbub.co.uk/

      Padova, Italy: the company I'm consulting for needs a front-end/UX guy.  The ideal person is someone who lives in the world of Javascript, and knows JQuery, as well as something like Backbone.js, keeps abreast of the latest developments in HTML5/CSS, and also has a good eye for design.  Bonus points for knowing your way around a Linux server, and having some Rails knowledge.The company is http://www.centervue.com/ and it's a pretty cool outfit.  They make devices that take pictures of your retina, amongst other things.  The team I work with are great guys, and smart hackers.

      Yikes Corp  ||  Tokyo, Japan /  San Francisco  /  Geoflexible  ||  CTOYikes is a social media content creation company. Businesses need daily text content for their Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, and blogs. We create that content at scale, hassle-free. Our customers are some of the largest ad agencies and brands in the world. Weâ€™re growing quickly and so far have managed to finance our own growth with our profits, but weâ€™re looking to fundraise soon.There are 2 people on the core team, and we coordinate a team of freelance writers who create all the content which we then sell to our customers. At the moment weâ€™re doing this all by hand, and we need a generalist-type full-stack engineer to give our company some much-needed tech muscle.The thing we need short-term is a web application which allows for content (text + links + images) to be input by our employees and passed through a workflow chain which ends at our customers. The thing we need long-term is a mechanism which allows our customers to be intelligently paired up with employees who would be a good fit for them- and also uses analytics from Facebook + Twitter + anything else to help us learn more about how to provide our customers with awesome, effective, engaging content. This is going to involve a lot of iteration and thatâ€™s why we need a new core member of our team instead of an outsourced partner or contractor etc. This is a green-field proposition: you can work with whatever tech tools you like. Youâ€™d be the guy or gal in charge and we will stay out of your hair about that kind of stuff.We are two dudes from the US whoâ€™ve spent a lot of time in Japan â€“ I live in SF now and my partner is in Tokyo. A lot of our clients are in Japan because thatâ€™s where we started, but weâ€™re scaling up in the US now too. You can work from wherever you want, Tokyo included.To make sure this works for everybody, weâ€™d like to do a 3-month trial period starting in January wherein weâ€™d pay you a monthly salary- and then, assuming everyoneâ€™s happy, youâ€™d get a substantial grant of stock (co-founder level). This is pre-financing, so youâ€™d be getting in on the ground floor.TL;DR: Weâ€™re good at business and sales but we suck at tech, come and work with us, #hacktheplanet. Email jobs@yikes.jp with a resume or github link or both.

      Which? (http://www.which.co.uk/) - London, UKAt Which?, we believe that individuals can be as powerful as the organisations they have to deal with in their daily lives. We engage in advocacy campaigns on various consumer protection issues and aim to promote informed consumer choice in the purchase of goods and services, by testing products, highlighting inferior products or services, raising awareness of consumer rights and offering independent advice.But for us, that's not enough. We want to look after consumers wherever and whenever they are to help them make the right decisions. So, we're currently revamping our digital presence by building a better infrastructure to support our products. As an example of what we've been up to, we recently launched http://university.which.co.uk which is a new mobile-friendly website designed to help students make more informed decisions about their higher education choices.The biggest challenge we face is designing and building a very broad range of other products in a more service-oriented and cross-platform manner. This will mean that there is a lot of starting from scratch, and having to decide upon the right tool for the right job (we're currently into Nodejs, Ruby, Java and PHP).So if you are a great team player and you are into designing service oriented application, playing with large volume of data aggregation or you just love to solve challenging problems, we'd like to hear what you think. We are hiring front-end and back-end developers.We're a diverse, sociable team, and you'll have the opportunity to make a big impact on the company and its future success.Feel free to email us at recruitment@which.co.uk for more information.

Itâ€™s a broad job description and weâ€™re looking for someone who loves being part of a fast-paced, constantly evolving work environment where your opinions and decisions will seriously affect our technical direction. Weâ€™re looking for a technology generalist with interest in specializing as necessary - It's more important that you love learning and can adopt new languages/frameworks/APIs very quickly.There are few companies poised to actually make an impact on people's lives, but Aidin is one of them.

      Stealth - San Francisco, CA (SOMA) - Full TimeAbout us: web / mobile - funded stealth, not a X-for-Y startupLooking for: Engineers (Full-stack / Frontend or Backend) | Mobile (iOS) Developers | Search Engineers | Designers---We're a team of engineers and designers (MIT, Cornell, ex-Microsoft/Google/etc) working on technology that helps users access their favorite online services and accomplish tasks in a more usable, efficient, and social manner. Our goal is to make an essential utility that people use everyday.We're funded by many notable investors (you've definitely heard of them - many are top 25 on AngelList). We haven't announced our product or funding anywhere so we can focus on building.If you're looking to get into an earlier stage startup (more equity, ownership, ...) that solves complex problems, then come find out what we're up to.We work mainly with JS (jquery and node.js). Mobile developers should be familiar with iOS/Android. We prefer designers have technical and UX backgrounds.Curious?

      San Francisco, CA. Full time. H1B okay.Sharing over social media is driving an ever-increasing percentage of web traffic, and becoming more central to the adoption and spread of every type of application. But app developers are flying blind -- not only are traditional web analytics very bad at tracking social traffic due to the rise of mobile clients and increasing prevalence of HTTPS, but even when they have the numbers, they don't have actionable data.That's the problem awe.sm solves: our platform tracks sharing behavior and results, and ties them back into meaningful metrics -- whether thats page views, signups, or a dollar value in sales. Our APIs and drop-in integrations allow developers to integrate social data deeply into their products without needing to reinvent the wheel (and our wheel is really shiny).We're an engineering-driven team building products primarily for other developers, so we're passionate about providing an amazing experience for developers. To help us get there, we're looking for a Developer Experience Lead, which you might also call a Platform Evangelist. By that we mean somebody who will own the experience a developer has using our product: somebody who understands deeply how to get the most out of awe.sm, and has the communication skills to get that information to developers. That will mean representing awe.sm at hackathons, conferences and other developer events, and being the primary point of contact for developers building on our platform on Stack Overflow and other forums. We want you to find the pain points before our customers do, and feed that information back to the engineering team, so we can adapt our product to real-world needs.This is an unusual role, combining technical talents with public speaking and writing skills, but for the right person it's a dream job, and there's no role more critical to our growth right now.http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernewsWe're 14 people right now. We have a cool office with awesome views ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) in the heart of the Mission. We have catered lunches, and full health, vision and dental coverage. We use an IRC server for team communication and are agile in the sense that we move quickly and react fast, not in the sense of having attended an overpriced training course.

Relocations Welcome, H1B Transfers Welcome.More at http://www.getlocbox.com/careers and http://www.techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/locbox-series-a/.Iâ€™m CEO at LocBox (http://www.getlocbox.com) and we are looking to work with great folks that share our mission - empowering local businesses to generate sustainable revenue from their best customers. We want to do it with Data, Algorithms and Design in a space that has traditionally lacked all three but is finally turning the corner (and fast).Most local businesses resort to unsustainable daily deals or boring Email Marketing to acquire and retain customers. We reject that status quo and our hundreds of (paying) customers agree. Weâ€™ve also developed a new search/crawl/tech-centric way of acquiring our own customers and disagree with the obsolete feet-on-street Sales model. The company is very small but generating material and predictable revenue; net revenue growth has exploded in the last quarter.Our tech team is 3 at the moment and the company as a whole is 9 fulltime folks; we're looking to at least triple the tech team size in the next 6 months. The tech stack is standard-issue Rails/HTML/CSS/JavaScript and is deployed on AWS. The product and tech team operates on weekly sprints and there's a decent bit of Halo-playing and beer-drinking at the completion of sprint milestones.We also just launched with a $5.1M Series A in the press w/ TechCrunch, AllThingsD, GigaOm and VentureBeat.Ready to talk to us? I'm saumil at getlocbox dot com and at http://www.getlocbox.com/careers.

  | Redwood City, CA - UI Engineer |
  +--------------------------------+

Tidemark Systems (http://www.tidemark.net, note ".net") is hiring.Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem.  For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of.  But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do.  So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great.  But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.  You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience.  If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code.  This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job.  This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.  The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.We've got a bunch of other openings (see http://tidemark.net/company/careers)    * UI Engineers
    * Director Corporate Communications
    * Product Support Engineer
    * Director of People Operations
    * Operations Engineer
    * Graphic Designer - Web Developer Emphasis
    * Enterprise Account Executive
    * Application Tier Developer
    * Computation Engine Developer

      The Ladders - New York CityLooking for full time on site developers.We hire people, not skills.Some stuff we use/do across our company:Java, Scala, Backbone.js, Storm, RabbitMQ, Puppet, Sass, Responsive Design, Objective-C and on and on.Ideal candidates probably have at least 5-7 years experienceHere is "job description", if you are interested, you can email me directly: sallen@theladders.com--Weâ€™re looking for a few good programmers to join our team and help us achieve our mission of â€œthe right person for the right job.â€�Instead of giving you a list of buzzwords to describe the role, weâ€™ll tell you about a project we started recently:A few months back, a small team of engineers and designers at The Ladders got together to design a new product. We started off by interviewing some of our customers to learn about their needs.  Using that information, we held design studios and brainstorming sessions to flesh out what the actual features and user experience would be like.On the front-end, we decided to build a new Javascript-powered rich UI using responsive design techniques. Many people are working on responsive design for content-based sites, but few are doing it for browser-based applications.On the back-end, we designed an Event Driven Architecture that makes use of Event Sourcing. Instead of updating a relational database in-place when things change, we store a series of discrete application events. We can then replay those events to create the state of the world at any point in the past, right up to the present. (Yes, weâ€™ve built a time machine!)Does this sound like the sort of thing youâ€™d like to do? If it is, weâ€™d like to hear from you.In return for your passion and commitment to code quality, youâ€™ll enjoy an awesome work environment with perks like:
Unlimited vacation days!  Yes, unlimited!
Quarterly hackathons
A game room and a well-stocked kitchen
Exciting events including holiday parties, picnics, talent shows, pumpkin carving and more
Company sponsored athletic teams
Competitive salary, bonus and stock options
Health/Dental/Vision Insurance, 401K
                      
                  
      This project does sound kind of nifty, but I'm confused about the company.  What is The Ladders.  Do you have a core product?
                      
                  
      We are a job matching company. We attempt to match jobseekers with jobs and recruiters with qualified candidates. Due to our history as a more standard job board, we have search tools however, the core of our experience now is matching.
Jobs and job search are a commodity, we are doing a lot behind the scenes to provide value that others can't provide.I'd be quite happy to discuss via email or gtalk.
                      
                  
      The Ladders is a job site specializing in only high-salary ($100k plus) jobs.It would have taken less time to google it than to type your comment.
                      
                  
      Actually, the ladders has been all professional jobs ( not limited by a salary range ) for over a year now.

      San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worldâ€™s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worldâ€™s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worldâ€™s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers
* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)
* iOS engineerThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/ (The Future of Peer Review) and here http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/ (The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine. We will handle re-location, including visas, if you would like to re-locate, but re-location is not necessary.If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu
