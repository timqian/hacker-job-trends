      Nava | Washington DC & San Francisco SF | Full-stack Developers, DevOps Engineers, Software Engineers, Frontend Engineers, Designers| On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k + equityWe're a small team (18 people!) of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix HealthCare.gov in the winter of 2013. Since then, we've been working with the government to improve the services HealthCare.gov provides. Our revamped Healthcare.gov application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to build, and itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      Do you currently employ any ninjas or pirates or hiring any? If so, what is the expected compensation?
                      
                  
      I was looking at Magic Leap's jobs a lot in the last week, do you mind giving more information about the teams / locations they're in?I don't have a degree and seeing a list of open jobs that are just names of degrees ( http://i.imgur.com/fK2BCvq.png ) scares me a lot, but Magic Leap sounds sooo cool!
                      
                  
      Hey, I'm highly enthusiastic about what Magic Leap is doing, and I'm looking for an internship next summer. I've been following the company quite closely, I actually reached out to the team via email (info@magicleap.com I think) about a month back because I didn't see a spot for internship applications, but didn't hear back.I'm currently interning at Apple. I'm passionate about prototyping for cameras as an AR platform, and the opportunity to pursue those ideas taken to the next level with Magic Leap would be incredible. I'm particularly interested in rapid prototyping, software engineering, and UX.
                      
                  
      Putting aside the ninja\wizard bullshit, you don't have any C++ focused positions in SF proper, do you?
                      
                  
      Screw the first impression bullshit too, eh?
                      
                  
      Indeed. :)

      Hey there. I'm not seeing a lot of hardware engineering positions in Mountain View. Do you think there is room for a robotics hacker like myself? Thanks.http://www.tlalexander.com/about/
                      
                  
      I have a lot of OpenGL and Unity experience. I wasn't sure which position to apply to so I applied to a few. Please don't hold that against me!

      Unfortunately not yet, though maybe next year. But we do offer a $1729 referral award if you refer a fullstack or iOS engineer that we end up hiring.
                      
                  
      That's a very particular amount!
                      
                  
      Of course :). 1729 is the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two cubes in two different ways:10^3 + 9^3 = 12^3 + 1^3

      Silicon Valley Bank | http://www.svb.com/ | Full-time or contract in San Francisco | ONSITE REMOTE INTERNS VISA (non-H1B)Help us build a modern, developer-friendly, API platform for banking services.
Banks are rife with inefficient, legacy technologies and Byzantine processes. It's frustrating for banks and even more frustrating for their customers. We're a small team of predominantly ex-Standard Treasury [1] engineers working to change that, one API at a time.We're looking for generalist and backend engineers of all experience levels. Our tech stack is Clojure and Postgres, but no experience with either is required. Our only hard requirement, and preference, is that you have strong software engineering ability (and that you can pass a background check--sorry, but it's a bank requirement).Our office is in downtown San Francisco. I won't enumerate all the comp and benefits here, but suffice it to say, we try to make both competitive and lucrative. Notably, if you'd like to live in the Bay Area, and don't live here now, we will pay to relocate you!If you're interested in working with us or learning more, email me at: jbrusstar@svb.com[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Treasury
                      
                  
      What in the world is "ONSITE REMOTE INTERNS VISA"?  Are you trying to hire foreign students as cheaper interns?
                      
                  
      I guess they are open to both on-site and remote positions. Also interns. And will sponsor Visas. That's the only interpretation that makes sense to me.... you could also try entering that in Scribblenauts to see what sort of creature comes up.
                      
                  
      From the main post:> include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome.
                      
                  
      At first I thought these were all separate tags for the listing, but I checked out their (surprisingly complicated) careers page, and I honestly can't figure it out. OP, can you help us out? Are any positions available for remote work?

      Toronto, Canada | Kira Inc | REMOTE ok in US/CAN | Clojure/ClojureScript Web DeveloperKira Inc. is a Toronto-based startup using machine learning to automate legal work. Weâ€™re looking for a developer to work on our Clojure and ClojureScript web application. Our stack includes reactive single-page web client code and a distributed backend to handle internal computations.
Our team is small, pragmatic, and inquisitive; we love learning new technologies and balance adoption with good analysis. To us, agile is a verb, not a noun, we adopt what works for us rather than strictly following a particular methodology. We prefer to hire near our downtown Toronto office, but also welcome remote work in a time zone within North America.This position is focused on internal tools such as application analytics and internal integrations. It involves a bit of everything in the web stack:  * Client-side UI code.
  * Server-side REST routes.
  * Platform and core APIs.
  * Document and report generation.

You should have knowledge of some of these. Most of all we look for those interested in learning.Please send us:  * cover letter â€” tell us why youâ€™re interested,
  * resume/linkedin profile,
  * link to github projects or other work samples.

Email your resume to kirasystems@applications.recruiterbox.com with "Web Developer" in the subject line or apply online at https://kirasystems.com/careers.
                      
                  
      This is neither here nor there, but how could agile be a noun? Did you mean an adjective?
                      
                  
      I guess it becomes a noun when usage commonly drops the implied "methodology", as in "Agile is honored more in the claim than in the practice."

      Walmart Technologies East | Reston, VA | Software Engineer - Junior/Mid/Senior | Engineering Managers| On-site - Full-time - Visa Sponsorship for new CS Grads already here in the US (after OTP)|
This is a new branch of Walmart Technologies (not to be confused with Walmartlabs that focuses on the .com site) that is focused on modernizing the stores systems and everything else that is not .com really. At Walmart, the possibilities are limitless and the people here in Reston are amazin (I actually mean this, I am a software engineer who just started last November and I am astonished at the projects I have been able to work on so far and the technologies I have used). We are a new team, the oldest member has been here a bit over a year, and we are trying to find the brightest and best software engineers anywhere in the world. We need them as the scale of the problems we are trying to solve is huge and we focus on creating elegant solutions for those problems. One big plus also is that we encourage continous learning and we love it when you contribute (or have contributed) to an open source project. We want to give back to the community in different ways too (we volunteer, and do meetups frequently). So if you are super smart, like to be surrounded by smart people, and like to solve difficult distributed problems, you should contact us!Just a note. For Junior devs, fresh out of school, we don't care what language you code in (even though we use Java here for the most part so at least you should be willing to learn it). For everyone else, we'd expect you to have a good working knowledge of at least one JVM language.
Get in touch at wmtech.reston@gmail.com
                      
                  
      Just passing through the thread, hope you don't mind some feedback:This ad is poorly formatted and contains a lot of fluff.- The people are amazing, the possibilities are limitless. I mean it! With no examples.- You work on hard problems. With no examples.- Creating elegant solutions is one of the most overused terms. Is anyone looking for inelegant solutions to difficult problems?- You're looking for the best and the brightest. I think everyone else is too.- You barely mention the technologies used except Java.- It takes reading the entire ad to find that the job has something to do with distributed computing.
                      
                  
      Hah! Sorry about that. You are right, it is poorly formatted. If I create one next month, I 'll make sure to clean it up and take yoru feedback into consideration :) But let me answer some of your points (that I didn't do properly in my post)- We work very hard in hiring smart people. Trying to continuously improve our hiring process and make it better. When I say the possibilities are limitless, I mean that Walmart is one of those rare companies where you can play with large distributed systems or also move teams and create awesome mobile apps, or (I believe) you can also play with robots (I have seen them, they wear hats).- Hard problems (in our context) is improving processes across the board and creating services that need to be fast (at a very high level) while still taking into consideration our legacy systems.- I hope nobody looks for inelegant solutions to problems. But I have seen complex solutions to simple problems many times. We are not looking for that. We are looking for simple solutions for complex problems (but you know, simple is hard)- Hey it's better to say best and the brightest than "Rockstars" or "Ninjas" or "Jedis" (actually I take that back, I like jedis).- Heh, you are right I didn't mention any technology we use :). We use Kafka, Cassandra, Neo4j, Storm/Spark/Flink, Hadoop, Apache Cordova for some mobile, etc- And yes, parts of the work has to do with creating distributed services, but not all of it, Reston is a small team so far and we are also working hard to create a great culture.
Thanks!

      Uber Technologies | Louisville, CO (just outside of Boulder, CO) | ONSITEHiring: all levels of backend focused software engineers and specialist software engineers who have significant experience in machine learning, computer vision, SLAM and/or LiDAR.The Uber Maps engineering team is partly based out of the Louisville office and we're building next generation mapping technologies. The teams here work on a variety of different projects, made up of specialists engineers as well as general, core software engineers. On the general software engineering side, weâ€™re building out image processing software, the data store that houses all maps data and the infrastructure that all other maps engineering teams build on top of. Some of the specialist work we do: building SLAM and LiDAR algorithms from sensor and street level image data collected by the team as well as developing machine learning algorithms to extract useful information from this street level image data. Unfortunately, the majority of the projects here are still confidential but it's mainly either specialist type projects that I mentioned above or backend, big data related projects using Java, Scala, Go, Spark, Cassandra and Mesos to name a few.A recent article was published that talks about the work, and the impact of it, that we're doing in Louisville: http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/ubers-...Interview Process: one 30 minute informal call with me, Two 45 minute technical phone interviews, and one onsite interview.Contact: nathaniel@uber.com
                      
                  
      Gradescope - https://gradescope.com | Berkeley, CA | full time | ONSITEAssessment in education is broken -- instructors spend hours grading, and yet don't get a clear picture of what their students are struggling with. Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments they've always used, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time. We're now applying computer vision to help instructors grade even faster.Our product has been used to grade over 10 million questions belonging to over 100,000 students. We recently raised a seed round, and are hiring a senior full-stack engineer to join our team of 7. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity. We've got a Rails backend with some React on the frontend.If youâ€™re interested, please email jobs@gradescope.com.

      R3 CEV | http://r3cev.com | London, UK | ONSITER3 is designing a next-gen distributed database in which the nodes in the peer-to-peer network making it up don't trust each other. Then we're building financial apps on top, because finance is the industry that can benefit from this technology the most. Many startups in this space are building on top of the Nakamoto blockchain algorithm, but we don't actually use a Bitcoin-style blockchain at all: that's why we simply call what we're building the distributed ledger instead.We're looking for a mix of sharp computer science generalists and people with experience in finance and banking. We are pushing the boundaries in VM and compiler technology, cryptography, systems programming, networking and fintech. Most of our software is written in Kotlin on the JVM (sort of a simplified Scala), but you don't need to know Kotlin: you can learn on the job.Although the job ad says ONSITE, we are open to remote working if you're the right candidate.Email me: mike@r3cev.com

We're a small stable team, looking for self starters.
My daily goal for our team is to always end the day making it better.As an engineer founder, I'd say our greatest strength is our ability to listen to our customers
and build a great product that solves their real problem.  I started by answering every phone call
and building features after each call.
From there we've grown rather quickly but at a stable clip.
We never raised money because we've never needed the money
and I've always wanted to keep control over the direction and pace of growth.After 6 years, I could never be happier with this decision.  Our development environment
is primarily RoR and JS.If you are a former LivingSocial or RevolutionHealth member you'd know me
and I believe appreciate our stack.  We make heavy use of Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis and Nginx+LUA.
We're running most of our servers in AWS.  Did I mention we're a small team, you'd have the opportunity to play a huge role.[Edit/Location] - Severna Park, Maryland nicely between Baltimore and Washington and super close to Annapolis.

      Pardon me, but hasn't Blythe Master's startup and R3CEV locked up entire financial institutions market already?  NASDAQ also has their own internal Blockchain project.What is Ripple's path for survival?
                      
                  
      Blythe's company, Digital Asset Holdings, is focused on securities settlement (different use case). R3 is a consortium - they do not have a product that they sell to banks.Ripple is the only company in the blockchain space that has an enterprise-ready product that banks can deploy for cross border payments.
                      
                  
      JPMorgan is championing their own blockchain as well.

      Application Security Consultants | Optiv | Anywhere in the US | Remote | https://www.optiv.comI'm a senior consultant with the Advisory wing of Optiv. We are hiring web app/mobile security consultants - basically, a client gives you a an app and some info and you try to find as many vulnerabilities if you can.  Being a profit center for the company has its advantages- our salaries are competitive (with a reasonable bonus structure to boot), and our work life balance is tough to beat - i took a few months off last year and nobody batted an eye.We'd like people who are comfortable working by themselves - you have the support of peers and the company's project management apparatus but the testing and customer work is generally pretty independent.  Being able to explain the OWASP top 10 and other common web security vulnerabilities is something you should be able to do in your sleep.  Mobile application skills and cloud security knowledge is a huge perk.  Finally, being able to explain and write clearly is important - you need to have both the written and verbal English skills to explain complex security concepts to both developers and shareholders.Feel free to e-mail me at john.labelle@ if you have questions or want to talk shop.

      Backend Engineer (Scala) | SoundCloud (Discovery/Recommendations) | Berlin | Onsite | Full-time | RelocationI'm an engineer on SoundCloud's Recommendations team. We are looking for scala engineers to help users find lit tracks on the world's largest audio platform. You'll work alongside data scientists and engineers in a stack based on Spark, Scala, Finagle, and Cassandra.SoundCloud is a wonderful place to work and Berlin is an amazing city to live in. I relocated from Canada and haven't looked back.Empfehlungen sind die Zukunft!job link: https://soundcloud.com/jobs/2016-08-04-backend-engineer-disc...

      I can vouch that working at soundcloud has been an excellent experience! It's truly an opportunity to work with such thoughtful, talented, and driven colleagues. Never a dull moment.

      Hey aaron, I'm an early bird soundcloud user and very interested in working for your company but don't have a lot of scala knowledge. Just did some lessons at home and some research at my last job including spark, prediction.io and the finagle stack. Does it make sense to apply to this job?
                      
                  
      What's the salary range of this opportunity? Considered Berlin ops in the past but the companies are notoriously cheap. Always need to establish upfront if the company is one of the rare Berlin companies offering internationally competitive packages or another trying to get by offering experienced devs 50k EUR with .1%-.2% equity, fruit, free drinks, and a foosball table.
                      
                  
      I can't speak openly about the specifics, but we're definitely not in the latter category.

With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction.

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsiteRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after three and a half years, weâ€™re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 57,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, weâ€™re looking for senior engineers and engineering managers: empathetic leaders who are excited about teaching, coaching and professional development.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out our newest product release here: https://clever.com/products/badges
