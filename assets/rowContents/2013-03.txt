Transcriptic: Core DeveloperMenlo Park, CATranscriptic is the "Amazon Web Services" for life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development. Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.We're a very small startup (you'd be #4), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.max at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/
                      
                  
      I'm a dual major in Bioengineering and Computer Science (graduating 2014) so this is incredibly exciting for me.  I don't know if you're considering new grads but if so I'll definitely be applying come May 2014.  What an incredible idea/execution.
                      
                  
      This is incredible. SO cool. I'm tied down in so many ways right now, but this is one of those moments where I wish I wasn't. If I hear of anyone, I will send them your way; enviously. Best of luck to you guys :)

      Gaaah, when did you post these!?  I already found an internship for the summer, but I would have adored working on Rust!
                      
                  
      Don't forget about us for next year!
                      
                  
      Are the intern positions strictly exclusive to students? I'm a recent CS grad (wasn't able to take on an internship during school) but I would love to apply for one of these positions.
                      
                  
      Are the intern positions only in Mountain View?
                      
                  
      Nope, there are intern positions in SF as well, although returning interns get priority for that location.
                      
                  
      Do you take part-time as well?
                      
                  
      Are you hiring in Berlin ?
                      
                  
      AFAIK our Berlin office is not fully armed and operational just yet, but we often hire people to work remotely.
                      
                  
      what happened to UI and UX internships?
                      
                  
      I don't know if that's an oversight or an intentional omission, but "Firefox Engineering" is code for "Firefox front-end coding".  That may or may not be the sort of UI/UX work you're interested in.If you want to do an internship and do design rather than coding work, I'd still suggest you apply.  I don't think Mozilla is so big yet that we'll toss an intern's resume just because it doesn't match up perfectly with one of our outstanding intern requests.

We have a number of exciting brands in the pipeline and are growing our team to execute. If you are interested in fashion - and using technology to innovate in that space - then send me a note!Our team is small, so we wear many hats. Our site is primarily in Python+Flask, with some PHP.On the backend, we have written tools to manage customers' eyewear prescriptions, manage orders and inventory with our lens laboratory, and give our employees great tools for taking care of customers.Since fashion relies on brand perception and recognition, we are looking for UX developers and designers who can understand a brand's aesthetic and create an eyewear website based around that. This will entail everything from a responsive website to, for graphic designers, print collateral that goes in the packages we ship to customers.I am the first engineering hire, so you'd be an early employee on the team. We want folks who can help out on backend infrastructure tasks and help us grow as we take on new brands.Finally, we are very much interested in hiring interns for the summer - we think you will learn a lot, and we will give you the chance to build some really cool things.If this sounds interesting, email me! jay[[at]]classicspecs.com

      Adzerk (http://adzerk.com) - Durham, NC (also Raleigh or Chapel Hill)Ready to put all those ideas about scalability into practice in a situation where you really need it? We're helping Stack Overflow and other sites that you've probably heard of serve billions of ads per month. At that scale, things get very interesting.As an engineer at Adzerk, you'll have the opportunity to work on all parts of our system, from the front-end web UI to the engines that serve the ads. Our system uses Node.js, C# (Mono), ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, MongoDB, Hadoop, and RabbitMQ.We're also looking for someone to fill a more devops-oriented role. We use Chef to administer our systems on AWS, build and deploy using Travis-CI, and monitor using DataDog (a pretty cool startup based around statsd).Performance and scalability are our two primary concerns, and with the traffic and growth rates that we're experiencing, lots of the lessons that you've learned start to break down. Because of that, it's not as important what you know right now â€“ what matters is how quickly you can learn and adapt.  * Your work will have an immediate and profound impact on our product and business.
  * We ship code dozens of times a week, and you will write code and push to production on your first day.
  * You will be responsible for making important decisions about what tools and libraries we use.
  * You will have a direct role in building the team, helping us choose additional team members as we grow in size.
  * We prize open source contribution. You should have a GitHub account already.
  * Everyone gets equity. We want a team of partners.
  * Unlimited vacation. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace.
  * Flexible work schedule, including working at home part-time if you want.

      (Throwaway because I do not want to reveal my identity)I'm sure not all of you guys are like this but I applied for the Graduate R&D Financial Software Development Engineer program a couple months back in your London office and the telephone interview went great but the face-to-face interviews were an absolute farce.Prior to the face to face interviews, I confirmed Java as my language of choice (simply because I knew my C knowledge was little and wasn't up to scratch at the time and was told that Java would be absolutely fine for the interview) but the first pair of face to face interviewers insisted on C based questions (i'd only had a little bit of C experience) which was nerve wracking.The icing on the cake was during my second face to face interview session on the same day, whilst answering the primary programming question, my interviewer decided it would be more appropriate to check his work email on his phone rather than listen to me talk and go through the problem (again in C where I tripped up slightly on malloc'ing memory but managed to solve with a bit of umming and ahhing in the end). It wasn't even a quick glance, he spent most of the time I took to work on the problem checking his email. I'm still not sure what to make of this because personally to me this was probably the most unprofessional/rudest thing that's ever happened to me at an interview. I wouldn't even dare to pull out my phone during an interview and I expect the interviewer to have the same courtesy unless it's an emergency.It was a decent experience and your offices (at least in London) are lovely but if you are looking for C/C++ specific graduate developers/engineers then that should've been made clear.

      VividCortex, Inc. (remote, Charlottesville, VA)About Us: Our products help our customers measure, analyze and understand system behavior at a very deep level. There are good tools in the application and network layers, but usable tools for servers and databases are practically nonexistent. Weâ€™re fixing that, focusing first on tools for MySQL.DevOps BrainiacOur backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (itâ€™s awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL, Cassandra and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is "we need another backend/infrastructure engineer."Front End BrainiacThe web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP, D3, Angular, etc., and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.Email us at jobs@vividcortex.com if interested.https://vividcortex.com

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not.

  | Redwood City, CA - UI Engineer |
  +--------------------------------+

Tidemark Systems (http://www.tidemark.net, note ".net") is hiring.Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem. For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound. The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.If this position sounds interesting, my email is on my profile page.
                      
                  
      Wello: SF or REMOTE fulltime (near pacific time)
At Wello (https://www.wello.com), we are rethinking how people get fit. Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.
We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market. 
Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.
We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distance. We are small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.
Our technical stack is Python and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ.
Contact us at dev@wello.co.

      Essess - Boston, MAHere's a posting we sent out last week to a few MIT mailing lists:Looking for a startup job? Want to make a difference? I, along with another MIT Media Lab grad, work at Essess and we're hiring.We looking for coders, building scientists, and computer vision experts.About our company: Forbes called us the "Google Street View of energy efficiency". We use thermal cameras to map energy leaks at city scales to help our customers make smart decisions about their energy use.Our first product, launching in the next month, is a home energy report that will allow home owners to literally see the heat leaking from their homes, allowing them make informed decisions about possible improvements.Here's our big idea: In the coming years, we want to create a nationwide energy market to allow us to identify properties that would benefit the most from an energy efficiency upgrade.We would offer free home improvements to homeowners. In return, the homeowner agrees to a fixed energy bill for some period of time. The homeowner, instead of paying the utilities directly, would pay us and in return would receive a lower, predictable monthly energy bill.Our mission is to build and drive this market. We're excited about using technology to help the environment and help people live more comfortable, less-impactful lives.That's our ideaâ€¦ but we need your help make it a reality.Come talk to us!

We believe that the best platform for our customers is one that provides them the flexibility to run any software, on any servers, and on any infrastructure provider that they want.We're looking for a frontend developer that wants to be instrumental in building highly-functional, client-side interfaces that bring that vision to life.I'd love to hear from you if:- you enjoy writing JavaScript and have significant experience building complex user interfaces with one or more open source frameworks such as Angular or Ember- you are eager to make an immediate contribution in a small distributed team of talented engineers and designers- you appreciate the ruggedness of prototypes, the power of promises, and the beauty of functional programming- the idea of building a client-heavy frontend that interfaces with one or more REST apps seems natural to you- you understand the software stack and have probably done your fair share of backend development in your career, but it just doesn't excite you like building the customer-facing aspects of software- you love to build awesome things and are not afraid to show itIf you have any questions about this position, feel free to contact me directly (check my profile).Check out the official job description and/or apply for this position at http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oPEaXfwk&s=HN

      Buffer (http://bufferapp.com) - Anywhere in the world (we're a distributed team of 10 people in the US, UK, Hong Kong and Sydney).I'd love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We have over 500,000 users and are on a $1M+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to hit the millions of users in 2013.We've consistently grown 15% MoM for the last year and are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts. That's where we are in need of some help.    So, we're looking for an Android Developer to work on our app.
    This includes taking over most of the work of the app which has
    70,000 downloads and more in the Kindle and Blackberry stores too.
    If you've worked with Android before, that's great. If you're a great
    hacker and have developed in Java or other mobile platforms that's
    awesome also.

If you're interested in coming on board, you will:    - work primarily with myself and Sunil, who has lead development
      so far and is now taking a more general tech role
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great
      approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, itâ€™s cool if not)
    - be friendly and comfortable helping our users
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and
      support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup before (would
      be awesome, itâ€™s cool if not)

One of our core values at Buffer is to "Default to transparency". I've told you above how many users we have, and our revenues. We raised $450k from awesome investors, and we are cash-flow positive. Within the team, there is even more transparency. We have an Open Salary policy where everyone knows how much everyone else makes.Another key value we have is to "Have a focus on self improvement". The thing that we do which I don't know that any other startups do, is that we have a daily 'standup' Google Hangout between pairs of people in the team (the pairs cycle each 2 weeks). As part of the call we share a daily improvement. Something we're working on to improve ourselves. It can be related to Buffer, but usually it isn't. Some examples of improvements people have worked on: start blogging every 2 weeks, speak at first event, speak to a new person every day, wake up an hour earlier. We all encourage each other with our improvements, and this helps us push forward much faster than otherwise. It's a really positive environment and there is built in accountability. Everyone here seems to progress at an incredible pace, we want to do everything to make that happen for you as well. Whether you want to start speaking, blogging, learning marketing or have other areas of personal growth, youâ€™ll have my personal support and the whole team as a resource too.If you're interested in all our values, you can take a look at them here: http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113Since we have Open Salaries at Buffer, I can tell you right now that your salary will be between $88k and $110k depending on your location (living costs) and experience.

      Hey Team,I imagine both of you are familiar with Stack Overflow so I just wanted to pass along some information so you have it on hand. Stack Overflow also has a careers section, Careers 2.0, which connects our community of 96,000+ developers and 18 million unique monthly visitors with companies looking to hire the best technical talent.I noticed CardDrop might be looking for a mobile developer in the Dallas area and I wanted to see if you've considered using Stack Overflow as a resource to connect with candidates.Please let me know if I can forward our media kit to you, or if right now is a bit premature to reach out. Thanks for your time!Best,
Robert

We've been around for six months now, have funding and revenue, and are looking to grow the team. (More about our personal backgrounds on the site - http://geteasypost.com.)At EasyPost we often receive bad data from our shipping providers. For instance, SuperShipper (carrier's name anonymized for the purpose of this post) may tell us it costs $0 to ship a package from San Francisco to New York. What a steal! Sadly, this isn't the rate that gets charged our customers at the end of the day we, not SuperShipper, look like idiots.We are interested in how you would solve this problem. Would you ask the user to check back later? Estimate the rate based on given data? Or do something entirely different?Sound interesting?

      SF, CA; ecommerce technology leaderOUR CHALLENGE:  ecommerce today is stuck as a metaphor of offline retail.  Online replications of the offline world may have extreme scale, but are highly disruptable since they are based on brick and mortar paradigms not actual customer/brand relationships.  iTunes was the best online record store imaginable, but Spotify is quickly disrupting it.  Amazon is a (very, very well run) giant Wal-Mart â€“ ecommerce can be better than massive-scale superstores.Our software changes the online retail from "superstores" to multi-year, high-value brand/consumer relationships.  We do this by facilitating long-term, multi-SKU relationships between brands and customers.   The first market we are targeting is household products â€“ because itâ€™s huge, underserved online, and going through rapid channel shift (and, the multi-SKU element works incredibly well in this niche).MISSION STATEMENT ePantry's mission is to shrink the environmental footprint of American homes by making sustainably produced household products the most convenient option for busy consumers. Our technology provides each individual with customized ongoing delivery of branded sustainable consumables (e.g. soap, laundry detergent, paper towels) simplifying the process of never running out of the products he/she needs.  You will enjoy buying toilet paper!WORTH KNOWING* High-friction (private) MVP reached $200k run rate in first month with $0 marketing.* Annual ARPU >$500* $40 billion niche with <2% ecommerce penetration* Well-funded by the entrepreneurs & investors behind Hotwire, Friendster, Everfi, and Citysearch* @RocketSpace* Niche ecommerce works: Alice, Dollar Shave Club, Manpacks, Quidsi, Zappos* Team of 4 full time.  Founder was employee #1 at twice startups that raised over $100mm\TECHNOLOGY LEADER: Experienced full stack web developer, knows his/her way around ecommerce, managing teams, lean-loving, not scared of big companies, desire to build something awesome. eco-warrior-ness not required.  All titles (CTO, co-founder) are on the table for the right person.You Get: Competitive cash, above-market equity, full benefits, flexible/fun environment, passionate team, and to leave the world a little better than you found it.CONTACT Would love to brainstorm about our challenges/opportunities over a coffee/beer any time.  sl@epantry.com

      SF - full-time, Front End EngineerAbout Statwing:We love analyzing data. We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and much faster.Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but theyâ€™re so dressed up in the arcane language of t-tests and p-values that theyâ€™re off limits to most humans, and painfully time-consuming for experts. Most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface thatâ€™s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.Weâ€™re two Stanford alums and we work in San Franciscoâ€™s Mission District, near the 16th and Mission BART stop. Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term "Data Science", built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).About the job:Radically improving the UI for data analysis is the core challenge of our company. As our first hire and only front-end specialist, you'll drive the function and feel of our UI, creating entirely new ways of interacting with data. Youâ€™ll meet weekly with the designer of the TiVo UI (an advisor of ours) to sketch out solutions to extremely challenging usability problems, which you'll then implement. You'll code in HTML, CSS/LESS, Ruby, and Coffeescript, using Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, and d3. And as the first hire, youâ€™ll earn significant equity and help shape our culture.The ideal candidate:Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product. Comfortable with UI and UX challenges. Graphic design skills are a bonus (we currently have none).. Interested in data analysis.. An extremely talented programmer, skilled with front end tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Coffeescript.. Familiarity with the other tools listed above is a bonus.
Deeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and front end architecture.. Open to asking for help, taking feedback, collaborating, and generally being a team player.. Humor. Has a sense of it.Email us at jobs@statwing.com

      IFTTT - http://ifttt.com/jobs - San Francisco, CAIFTTT is looking for experienced engineers to help build the next generation of its platform.This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the webâ€™s most innovative and exciting services. Youâ€™ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.IFTTTâ€™s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. Weâ€™ve built a system that enables users to set up simple â€œif this, then thatâ€�-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.Weâ€™re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but weâ€™re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end weâ€™ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. Weâ€™re hoping you can be the next one.

      Amsterdam, Netherlands. No remote.I have a blog where I try to help people move to other countries and one company contacted me about helping them find people willing to move to Amsterdam (I used to live there and it's a gorgeous city!).So now I'm letting people know that there are front end, UX designer and back-end jobs available there. If they like you, they'll sponsor the work permit and help you relocate.Front-end work is typical HTML, Javascript. UX designer is Photoshop, Gimp, whatever you want, so long as you can do great UX work. Back-end is Perl/MySQL, but they'll train good developers.  http://www.overseas-exile.com/p/jobs.html
                      
                  
      When I hear about Perl and Amsterdam, it is almost always that company (I won't spoil it here) ;)I just wonder, where do they keep so many Perl devs, assuming they actually hire people.
                      
                  
      Perl + Amsterdam => booking.com
                      
                  
      Because this is an experiment for the company in question, they've been very clear that I'm not allowed to use their name at all. Thus, I can't confirm or deny (I won't spoil it here) ;)
