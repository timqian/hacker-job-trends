We don't hire for this team very often, but we're looking to hire a couple of people now.  We last posted on this thread about a year ago, and successfully found someone who now works on the current team, so we're trying it again.Despite our small size, we're in charge of a number of important products.  We run the software that powers YC's application process, software that almost every investor in silicon valley uses (https://blog.ycombinator.com/investor-day-software/), and Bookface, a private community site that is very actively used by YC founders.  This year we launched two big new projects - Startup School (http://startupschool.com/) and Work at a Startup (http://workatastartup.com/).  Those new projects are going very well - we have over 26K founders signed up for Startup School - and we want to double down on them.An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners - from our dinner talks to demo day.  You'll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you'll get to know and learn from hundreds of companies.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point.We also offer highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC's portfolio.

      In reality this is a qualitative metric. If you can produce value as quick as our CTO Shevek then we will have no issue paying you at the top of the range.As a bootstrapped company (9 employees in 6 countries, no two of us have the same nationality) - we pay a reasonable base and pay a significant year end bonus that is influenced by your work during the year, our profitability and where you live.No doubt this is not a satisfying answer, but as a small company we have great flexibility to structure packages to meet each team member's requirements.

      Honestly, I would worry that the idea of a compensation package based mostly around bonuses just leads to a massive amount of infighting and politicking and other nastiness from people jockeying for an extra 20k. If I get stuck doing some bug fixes and refactoring for a couple months am I going to lose out to the person who launched 2 new features?Not trying to be a jerk about it, but as a potential applicant that is my concern. d

We're led by repeat founders, advised by three of the most prominent healthcare leaders in the U.S., and backed by some of the best seed funds on earth (First Round, BoxGroup, etc.). Since day one, helping patients has been part of our DNA.

We're profitable, growing quickly, and have raised money from great technical founders, including Paul Graham, John + Patrick Collison, Nat Friedman, Greg Brockman, etc.The market for custom enterprise apps is huge. And we think that we have a promising shot at capturing much of it: we have a product that works, that customers love (go talk to any customer), and whose usage is growing rapidly.We've significantly de-risked the business (good signals of early pmf, completed 10+ unaffiliated sales via cold email, are profitable, etc.). But there's plenty of uncertainty left as well. For example: how do we convert early pmf into actual pmf? How do we scale sales? Should we be doing sales or marketing? Should we be selling to technical or non-technical people?We're looking engineers (full-stack) and AEs (you should have experience selling SaaS software). Youâ€™ll be talking to customers multiple times a day, no matter what the role. Since weâ€™re still early, youâ€™re also welcome to learn about other aspects of the business, like marketing, sales, or whatever else.If you're interested, please email jobs@tryretool.com. Thanks!

Latacora runs whole security teams for startups. We're a weird kind of consultancy: we have only one kind of client, and we work full-time with them for 6-18 months, doing everything every startup security team does, from software security to cryptography design to AWS and container lockdown.Our team has been doing security work together since 2005. And for almost as long, we've been hiring people who read these kinds of HN comments, in our own weird way. We don't care about resumes or your previous work experience. We don't care how much security work you've done before. All we care about is whether you're interested in, engaged with, can lock in on our kinds of technical problems: finding security gaps and flaws, fixing them, and building software to mechanize the process.More than you could want to know about our hiring process: https://latacora.com/careersWe're just starting to ramp up hiring and I'm a bit of a mess with it, but our process is better than it ever was at Matasano.

Partially legal, partially because that's not where our customers are. Since we're so embedded with our customers over an extended period of time, there's more reason for them to be squeamish about data leaving the US, non-US workers, that sort of thing.If the EU turns out to be a serious market opportunity and we grow a ton I'm sure we'll revisit that at some point.

      Yeah, good point. if anything, my experience looking at this from the inside is that the bar that is set is much lower than it seems from the job postings.What does "cryptography design" mean in the context of a startup? Surely most CRUD startups aren't rolling anything close to low level crypto, and in most cases it'd be ill-advised to do so.I have to assume this is designing the implementation of existing crypto libraries, products, etc.I would be curious to know about the currently salaries. More than a year back I spend some some on the Matasano challenges, I think I did about half of them, I also read through half of 'Web Application Hacker's Handbook' which was sent to me. When I was at that stage,it occurred to me that I should ask about the salary, and I did that while talking to one of pen testers at Matasano. It was about $150k for the city of New York. This was not sufficient incentive to leave my job, the figure even seemed lower than what I earned if adjusted for cost of living.I guess I don't know a lot about NYC living costs but $150k for what seems to be an entry level position seems generous to me. Even allowing $3k a month for a one bedroom apartment, that's over 70k in after tax income for other expenses. It's more disposable income that I have now as a senior developer working remotely, though granted my pay isn't great. Plus the position listed is also remote.Perhaps I should rephrase  my question and overall context, I think. I'm a developer with about 15+ years of experience. At the time I used to earn about $110K in a no tax state. What incentive would be there for someone like me to switch jobs unless they the pay is more than what I earn? I certainly don't mind taking a cut in my pay temporarily. But say within a year I expect to be making much more than what I currently  earn.
Now while I agree with you that $150 may seem generous for an entry level position, a seasoned developer starting at an entry level crypto  position already know a fair number of things that will help him significantly in his crypto job, and cannot be quite considered entry level.I view having the developer skills as more of a prereq for the job and not really a bonus, but that's just my inexperienced opinion. All I know is that I'd be plenty happy with $150k working remotely, I'm currently making about half that as a full stack dev remotely.The incentive for me would be that I'd vastly prefer a security job over making CRUD web apps all day. So I'd take the job even at a pay loss.

      I am canadian in toronto, canada. Can I work remote? I can get TN visaYou don't need a visa to work remotely for a US company if you're doing the work while in Canada (I have a couple Canadians on my team).Really, it just comes down to payroll, insurance and benefits... that's where the complexity is. Taxes are easy, you pay income tax as usual in Canada under the reciprocal tax treaty (taxes are the government's main concern around working in another country).In this case, that would get complicated since they want you to be in Chicago sometimes. So, they'd need to figure out the payroll, insurance and benefits and you'd have to get an E1 visa. An E1 "trader" visa lets you work onsite in the US (but you can't live here). An E1 visa can be arranged for about $6000 CDN.

Its not hard for US companies to work with remote Canadians but there is a perception that taxes, payroll, insurance is hard when its not. Its frustrating because the US dollar has more buying power so they can get higher quality developers at a lower rate.are people that completed about half the microcorruption ctf a decent fit for your company or is it more of the people that finished the entire thing without breaking a sweat kind of thing?I suspect this was answered by this line of Thomas's post:> If you're interested in doing security work, and you can code, you can't waste my time.

      Wow... that is really strange. If you're wanting to apply but can't, you can just email me your resume and explain this is happening in your email. Apologies about that.Very glad to see some Remote jobs in Memphis.. I actually live in Memphis, have worked at UTHSC, and I've got a BINF M.S. from U of M.. Are you open to Remote if I'm already here?Hey Ethan, glad to hear that you are already in the same city! If you're interested in that arrangement, I'd encourage you to apply and just specify your situation in the cover letter.I've had a few requests for details, so I'll post some of my responses here in the comments.Re: common technologies- ASE/SSE: Python is the main language used in these positions. We work in a variety of other languages (Java, C, C++, bash, Perl) as genomic tools are written in all these languages. We've done some experimenting in Rust (https://github.com/stjude/fqlib), and we're just getting started in seeing how Rust might fit into the genomics community.- BPE: For this position, the ability to work in multiple middle-stack and front-end frameworks is necessary. NodeJS and React/Vue are likely to be the workhorses here.Re: team/project cultureThe St. Jude Cloud team is a little bit like a start-up within St. Jude. All of the positions posted here are software engineering positions, but we all wear many hats on the team. Everyone participates in product design and user feedback gathering by meeting with doctors, bioinformaticians, and everyone in-between. We're very interested in doing quality software engineering in the genomics space (historically, biological discovery has taken priority IMO) and also in experimenting in new technologies/languages.Sharing genomics data and tools is hard. We're attempting to set the standard for how genomics data is shared in a federated data sharing model (many institutions build subsites that talk to one another) rather than the centralized model (one or two centralized databases that every institution submits data to). This results in an environment that's always presenting new challenges, which is great if you're into that! Anything that's worth doing can be stressful at times, but the fact that we are working on something that's altruistic (in general, advancing cures for kids with catastrophic diseases) is what keeps me motivated.Re: working at St. JudeLast, I'll just make a quick plug that St. Jude is a great place to work: we were recently voted the number one place to work for Gen Z: https://www.nshss.org/media/30907/2018-all-companies_ranked....! We consistently make the top 30-ish companies in the world. Last, you're working on something that's truly making a difference, so it's a really positive environment.Re: remote vs. on-siteFor these positions, we're considering both on-site and remote arrangements. I'd like to say upfront that on-site has worked better than remote for us so far. My gut feeling is that this is due to the nature of the work we're doing (building a product where an end-user sits right next to you) and the fact that the rest of our team is on-site. Don't let that deter you from applying if you are remote only and are excited by this opportunity! Just be sure to specify in your cover letter.Re: is biological/genomics experience required?No, although the willingness to learn genomics is required. We're looking to hire strong software engineers for these positions, we have plenty of domain expertise in-house!For anything more, email me!

      I'm assuming you're the hiring person behind the positions, but I would like to make sure I address the cover letter correctly. Should I address it to you? Also, is the remote option available on the associate job(s)? I'm not against moving to Memphis, but would prefer remote.Sure! You can address to me, or you can just address it "to whom it may concern" (there are a few HPC positions in those job postings, so that would be a different manager). We're not going to count it against you either way :).My advice on the cover letter is to just be honest about your situation. If you're only going consider remote, let us know that. If you prefer remote but would consider on-site as you say here, let us know that too! It's all going to come down to a discussion about whether we're the right fit for you and you're the right fit for us, so it benefits both sides to be as candid as possible (just my two cents).If you're thinking about applying, it doesn't hurt to email me and just say that you applied from the HN post so I can keep my eye out for it!

      Not a problem at all, I'll get it sorted. If you could include a sentence or two on what tripped you up, I'll relay that to our HR department to make it more clear for future applicants.is REMOTE okay for all of these positions? I applied to St. Jude's awhile back and indicated that I would not relocate (was hoping to be remote) and never heard back.First, I'll say that I can't speak for all of St. Jude â€” it's a big place and it's going to vary from position to position. On-site has historically been preferred because of the energy on campus and the nature of the work. In my opinion, the institution as a whole is starting to become more open to the remote working arrangement.For these positions, I'm considering remote applications. If you apply, just be sure you specify it in your cover letter (and be sure to email me directly if you don't hear back!).

      Appcues | Senior Frontend Engineer | Boston, MA | ONSITE | Full-time | https://www.appcues.comAt Appcues, weâ€™re helping teams create products their users love. We think leaving a great first impression is a large part of that, so we've created a platform that lets product managers create onboarding experiences for their productsâ€”without needing to write any code.Many front-end engineers spend a lot of time doing the same non-domain-specific work at every company: building onboarding tours, modals, and tooltips. Like AWS did with many non-domain-specific backend tasks, we're here to take this burden away from the engineers and empower product managers to do it themselves, freeing engineers to work on the hard technical problems they really enjoy.Major companies like Canva, Lyft, and IBM are already using us to create amazing user experiences, and over 30M people have seen experiences built with Appcues this year.Appcues' web products are built with ES6, React, Redux, Styled Components, and the rest of the modern frontend tech cast.We're looking for a great frontend engineer to bring our product and user interface to the next level. You will collaborate directly with our users and our 14 incredibly talented engineersâ€”veterans from companies like HubSpot, PayPal, Bose and the MIT Media Labâ€”to ship product that solves real problems.Hit me up, apply online, or check out our glassdoor for more information.

I come from more of a front-end background with some knowledge of working on the backend as well, but don't have extensive experience with the BE technologies mentioned in the postingWhat kind of backend experience do you have? We don't need you to have PHP experience, but you should know one scripting language.I have done ASP.Net before and dabbled in rails, django etc. It's been 2 years since I actively worked on the backend though, I still go in once in a while to fix bugs and whatnot but nothing super extensive.I think that level of experience is fine, as long as you understand that you would be doing full stack work in the role :)Not important, but full stack experience is needed.Sequel | Microsoft Stack developer, devops and testers | Malaga, Spain | ONSITE, REMOTE with some F2F | Full-timeSequel is a leading provider of insurance software, specialized in the Lloyd's market, headquartered in London, UK.

      VMRay | Software Engineer - Rust | Bochum, Germany | ONSITEVMRay is a young company based in Bochum, Germany doing automated malware analysis. While our main focus is on dynamic analysis using a sandbox, we also recently started working on a static analyzer to reduce the overall analysis time and enrich our reports with information carved from the file's contents. Our initial release is written in pure Python which, as you know, has its limits performance-wise. So we are now looking into rewriting certain performance-sensitive parts of the static analyzer (such as file parsers) in a faster language. We think Rust especially well suited for this task, due to its safety guarantees, which are naturally important when working with malicious files, as well as its good interoperability with Python.Since we have no experience with designing and implementing software in Rust yet, we are looking for a seasoned Rust developer to help us out. Aside from developing on the static analyzer, our "Rust guy" should be willing and able to mentor other team members to get up to speed with the language, as necessary.If that sounds interesting to you, please consider applying at: https://careers.vmray.com/apply-software-engineer-rust-en/.
