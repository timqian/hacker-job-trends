      > At Palantir Technologies, he created a technology platform to help two of the top five U.S. banks recover from the housing crisis.*Um, didn't the taxpayers bale-out the banks?I'm pretty sure both of these things could be trueWithout our consent, I might add.I certainly thought it was a good idea. I also thought that some banking executives were criminals and should have gone to jail, but I think that avoiding the collapse of banks was a good thing.Thanks for helping out the enemy and bragging about it, Quinn.I had no idea who Quinn Slack was until this post, but:a) this seems a pretty personal attackb) characterizing "banks" as "the enemy" seems a little over dramatic. While I'm no fan of some of the actions of some banks some of the time, that doesn't make them intrinsically evil.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is â€œboutique consulting firmâ€� as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.
Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

      Excellent script. It matches "401k" however, so it might be worth matching against "401k" specifically. Also, I would recommend to others to give the whole thread a once-over after running the script, as it seems I've upvoted a couple of companies that had a big stream of complaints, and personally I do not upvote ads with complaints, even if they do other things (i.e. salary range) right.

      Elation Health | Senior Software Engineers | SFO or Remote | Full TimeI want to post an apology. A few months ago our recruiting process was going well enough that we had a comment in our HN post from a candidate we'd passed on who was happy enough with the experience that they recommended us in the thread [1]. Last month, however we had the exact opposite experience. Two candidates commented about investing significant effort in the process, only to be ghosted [2].I arrived at those comments too late to reply, so I'm using this month's post to apologize. I dug into what happened here and found that we did indeed drop the ball with a few candidates and failed to follow up. Certainly it wasn't our intent and doesn't reflect our values. We've audited the entire candidate pool and have reached out to anyone that fell through the cracks to properly close the loop.  I personally apologize for your poor experiences and the criticism is well deserved.I also want to thank the people who commented. I think posting that kind of feedback warning others is an excellent way to keep other members of the community informed, and hold each-other accountable. In this case we've overhauled and streamlined our processes so that we're confident this won't happen again in the future. So thank you for helping us do better, and I'm very sorry that this improvement came at the expense of your time.We are hiring, positions are here: https://boards.greenhouse.io/elationhealth and more about what we do at https://elationhealth.comAs always, my contact info is in my profile and I'm happy to chat with anyone directly or answer any questions transparently in the comments (I'll monitor those today).[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14901945[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15384536
                      
                  
      As someone who interviewed with Elation (and ended up not making the cut), I can confirm that they were professional throughout the process and can't imagine that they'd ghost people intentionally.
                      
                  
      I did have to follow up somewhat doggedly at points, but overall I had a good experience with the recruiting process at Elation (despite being passed over).
                      
                  
      Are you guys open to remote from India
                      
                  
      Right now we're based in PST (California) and have been considering remote folks within three time zones in either direction (so roughly North/South America). It's possible that could change in the future though, so do feel free to reach out if you'd like to be considered/contacted in the future if that happens!

      Top Hat | https://tophat.com/work-with-us/ | Toronto, ON, Canada | ONSITE Full-timeTop Hat is hiring!! We are looking for smart software engineers to join our team. We are hiring a Full-stack Web Developer (Python, Django, Javascript, React.js/Flux, AWS, Ansible; recently weâ€™ve been practicing Continuous Deployment on Lambda). Salary range based on experience from $80K to $120K.Weâ€™re a pretty awesome growth-stage startup in the education space - we make the classroom more interactive, fun and engaging for both students and professors. We raised our Series C round in order to take on the textbook industry, which you can read about here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-15/top-hat-r... - Union Square Ventures joined us this round, who along with our previous investors make up some of the top VCs in the world (having funded companies like Kickstarter, Twitter, Shopify, Salesforce, Box.net, etc.).
Top Hat helps professors make every lecture count by transforming mobile devices into powerful engagement tools, inside and outside the classroom. Recently, Top Hat has been building out interactive textbooks and creating a way for professors to collaborate on authoring new content and sharing it through our marketplace. In summary, we have a great dev culture and some really cool problems to work on!Apply here: 
https://jobs.lever.co/tophat/966fdf04-d9f5-40f9-bb0e-3b3fde9...
                      
                  
      I've applied to TopHat in the past. I and found their hiring process to be humiliating and waste of time for serious developers.I would have linked the a previous hacker news thread if I could because their was a stream of complaints from other developers who applied and found their hiring process broken.I routinely interview for jobs because it good practice so I expect certain things but TopHat stood out as bottom of the barrel process.I would ask they share if they've improved their hiring process over the years, since what I say could have changed.
                      
                  
      I recently moved to Toronto and found myself in job search mode again. I interviewed at 3 different places and though I wouldn't say TopHat's was an absolute waste of time, it was the least pleasant.The initial call was nice enough, though the second stage was algorithm and optimization focused. You should be fine if you're comfortable with HackerRank-like problems with optimizations and search-based algo problems, otherwise good luck. There's also a third on-site stage, though I can't speak to that experience.The second person interviewing me clearly didn't want to be there, and gave no shits except for the most precise solution. Even though I produced correct answers and walked through my thought process, he kept pressing for something 'faster'. And no, I didn't nest a bunch of for loops.
                      
                  
      Former employee: used to be a shitty place to work at, but I head inserting CTO as a buffer between CEO and Dev team has helped. The fact it was necessary is something worth thinking about.
                      
                  
      Hey there. Thanks for your comment. I've been recruiting here since the Spring for the prod/eng roles. I think we have improved the process quite a bit in that time. Can you let me know the kind of things that could use improvement from your perspective? I would appreciate any feedback you could give! cheers! -Katy

      No offense intended, but I've seen this same posting here the past 3 months with the same description. Several people (including myself) have reached out to learn more and received no response. I'm sure this has drawn a good amount of interest, but I'm curious: has anyone actually received a reply?
                      
                  
      Haven't received a reply either. Also have seen the OP post the same response here multiple times. Is there much benefit in keeping the flood gates open if you're already overwhelmed?
                      
                  
      Hi Nate, sorry, we have received a lot of applications. It's been impossible to reply to all. We also had to pause the application process during the last 3 weeks, and we are resuming it today.I promise we'll send an email to everyone once we move to the next stage in the coming couple of weeks(we're still screening). Apologies again.
                      
                  
      FYI, sounds really interesting, but I'm going to pass.With all due respect, this behaviour is a hiring smell.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the update.I too reached out early-October. Should we assume our initial contact will suffice, and you will be replying if there is mutual interest?
                      
                  
      Precisely. We'll contact you if we find your profile interesting.
                      
                  
      >> I promise we'll send an email to everyone once we move to the next stage>> Precisely. We'll contact you if we find your profile interestingWhich is it? 
I realize it's S.O.P. in the talent acquisition business to keep the net open and catch one fish while the rest swim around in the pen, but hold yourself and your company to a higher standard.
                      
                  
      I understand, I'm just looking to hear from someone who has received a response. Have you been requesting applications for 3 months but haven't reached out to anyone?
                      
                  
      Hi, to confirm, I've received a response from these guys :) I wasn't successful but I have received a response.
                      
                  
      Ok! Thanks for letting me know. It just seemed strange.
                      
                  
      Yes, we've reached to many people with a very specific background... and since I posted today's job offer I've personally replied to like 20 emails.
                      
                  
      Okay. Again, I don't mean any offense, I know this stuff takes time. It just seemed strange that so many people were saying the same thing.
                      
                  
      Not sure why downvote, it sounds like an honest response.
                      
                  
      Because you shouldn't tell people to contact them and then ignore them like they don't matter. How you treat candidates is a good indication as to how good of a company you are. When I posted on HN years ago I made sure to contact every single person back because it's the right thing to do.
                      
                  
      I'm going to chime in here also. I sent an email quite a while ago and heard absolutely nothing. Considering I have basically an unbelievable amount of experience related to this I was surprised that I didn't even get a followup or inquiry.Hiring is hard, this could be just the result of poor hiring practices, or it could be something else entirely. Either way, it gives a very poor impression, and considering how small the pool of talent in HFT and Smart Contracts is that isn't something a new company can afford to do.
                      
                  
      >  Hiring is hard, this could be just the result of poor hiring practices, or it could be something else entirely.This is the result of reaching the top of Who's Hiring twice, we received almost 2k emails when we expected 50-100. I'm the only one screening CV's with 1-2 hours/day available for this task.If anyone is expecting a Google structure behind this, then no. We are 3 normal guys starting a new project from scratch, and said it in the job posts. Because of the growing interest in crypto, we had massive unexpected success with our job posts and we are a bit overloaded.We are sorry for any inconvenience that this has caused. We won't post again until we have a recruitment team in place.
                      
                  
      I'd suggest then to put perhaps even a small team to help with the recruitment process? Maybe 2-3 person who can review and screen around 100 CVs per day? Tedious task, but doable.
                      
                  
      I also reached out to you several times and you did not even bother to reply. Even Amazon, Google and Microsoft replies, at the very least with a sorry not this time default answer.
                      
                  
      Sorry, I've sent you an email.
                      
                  
      No response heard since last contact, seen it way too many times here.
                      
                  
      No worries, makes you believe it is a fake ad. Landed a job already :)
                      
                  
      Pinged you last week but never heard back.
                      
                  
      Thanks, Jose.  HN folks, Jose really did reach out and seems sincere.  A response, even an auto-responder, is always appreciated when the HN community is involved and I think he understands this now.
                      
                  
      If they read the mail, it doesnâ€™t take much longer to reply a no with some copy/pasta. It is basic respect.
                      
                  
      Ridiculous! There are maybe hundreds of resumes being scanned. How could you do anything other than send a generic response? Why would you want a generic reply saying â€œyup, got your resume, email still works...â€�Show yourself some respect and stop complaining about being rejected. You sent an email, they didnâ€™t reply, ignore it.Not one reply gave a good rationale...downvote all you want.
                      
                  
      There's a difference to getting your feelings hurt and expecting a little decency. A company the solicits applications should definitely be held to the later.
                      
                  
      Respect and decency is a 2-way street. I've stopped posting jobs to HN because, even though I explicitly state that I'm not looking for interns or remote candidates, I still get hundreds of e-mails asking if I will make an exception. The ones I reply to are often persistent, and even sometimes accuse me of some sort of "-ism" for rejecting them.
                      
                  
      You're assuming a lot... they could also be trying to get their attention again. Why would you give up just because you didn't hear back? Persistence is good.
                      
                  
      Shouldn't have bothered with a throwaway to demean people for wanting an answer to their emailSure, ignore spam applications but do send a note to let them know they got it
                      
                  
      You don't have time to reply to people but still have time to post here every months...
                      
                  
      Sent you a follow-up about the Principal Security Engineer position, I'd love to have a chat.
                      
                  
      Yeah these guys are a bit disorganized o.OWhich is rather disappointing considering the potential of the space.
                      
                  
      Welp, I'm an ass, just got a very thoughtful e-mail from Jose, pay no attention to my comments...
                      
                  
      Hey JosÃ©, I also sent an email a couple of weeks ago and didn't received any reply
                      
                  
      Pedro, I just sent you an email. Apologies for the delay...
                      
                  
      Then what's the scam? I'd imagine they're looking for a very specific skill set (those tech skills, but in the context of crypto).

      Is that pre or post taxes?  How do people survive in London with such low salaries?   It always baffles me, as I live in NYC (which is equally expensive).
                      
                  
      Not parent but we always talk pre-tax in the UK. Take home on Â£60k is ~Â£3,548/month or ~Â£3,255 if you have a student loan."Survive" is the right word. It's likely insufficient to save enough money for a deposit anywhere commutable to their job while also contributing significantly to 
 savings and a pension.A single person in a studio/1 bed with a not-too-bad commute would probably spend Â£1300-1600 on accommodation/travel/council tax/utilities. (Sure, you can find god-awful "studios"/houseshares for less...).We basically just accept less and less. 1 bed -> studio -> house share. Give up idea of buying a house. Contribute less to pension. etcPeople who want to earn more in London tend to do contracting.
                      
                  
      Pretty much same experience. Used to live in a awful houseshare (read: sewage problems like once a week), then decided to spend the money on a single. Salary covers rent + electricity and council bills, but saving for a deposit on an apt anywhere within ~1h commute to central is pretty damn impossible.
                      
                  
      Bedford's a 1 hour commute and on 60-80k you could do better than some studio flat
                      
                  
      It's worth noting that GBP lost ~20% of its value last year (although it retained some value recently)And that companies advertising for 80k will possibly stretch to 100k for the right candidate.100k =~ 5k/month 
And a reasonable 1 bed is 1500-1800 somewhere decent to live.So, it's not exactly like you can't survive.
                      
                  
      Agreed, it is a reasonable amount, but how many London companies outside of finance/trading have you seen advertise 80k-100k? The most common numbers I see is 45-65k.
                      
                  
      I've not seen anyone advertise at 100k.But I had a profile on Hired.com open for ~ a week, and all the companies who I normally see advertising 60-80 offered me 100.That's about 10 datapoints saying that for the right CV they'll go there.
                      
                  
      Something to aspire to then! :)
                      
                  
      I basically never see this advertised, however roles which are Â£100-120k roll into my inbox a few times a month. Not all of them are in finance.To be honest, I get the feeling finance goes much higher than that for the right person.
                      
                  
      I'm a software engineer in London (3 years experience), I earn Â£45k + bonus (5-10%). That puts me around 85-90% percentile for earnings in the UK. Is that low?I live in a 3 bedroom penthouse with my friends, 15 minute cycle to work. Under 40% of my net income on rent, about that with bills. Used to be significantly cheaper but we moved (very) upmarket. I guess a 1 bed would be a bit more expensive, but 1 beds tend to be mostly for couples.
I save maybe 25-30% of my net income and spend the rest on social stuff and holidays.I don't feel like I'm just surviving, I feel embarrassingly wealthy compared to my (non software) peers. Surviving on the average London salary would be a different matter.
                      
                  
      That works as long as you share rent with 2 other people and have no kids, try supporting a family on that and things change.
                      
                  
      When I lived in London roughly 40% of my salary went to rent. London was actually more expensive, at least for a 1BR with roughly the same distance to the city center, as NYC.
                      
                  
      Not OP, but I think that is pre-tax. Most salaries I've seen are quoted in gross terms.  
As far as living in London, a lot of people have roommates/live in flatshares to save on rent or live in the commuter towns around the M25 belt (big highway surrounding London). 
Startups in London offer significantly less salary than SF/NYC. You can earn by being a perm employee in finance or contracting.
                      
                  
      Most of the difference is down to currency variation and working conditions (e.g. most UK companies give 25-30 days holiday).If you benchmark it within country by comparing the ratio median dev salary/median salary there's not a huge difference between the US and UK (the US is a bit higher by about 10% IIRC) - although SF is higher.
                      
                  
      I applied to them a few weeks ago with years of PHP & Symfony experience. Their comments back to me said that previous FinTech experience was also a requirement.
                      
                  
      What is the Venn diagram of people who have experience in those frameworks, in finTech, and in London?

      Love LaTeX, but more a Perl dev, than Ruby or JS. No experience at all on Ruby, but used to JS (browser side). Also, love C, for what that might be relevant :-)I am an OpenSource enthusiast, using Git (lab and hub), and working my first steps in CI.I've been using ShareLaTeX since it was born. Lately, using OverLeaf, mostly to try to understand what is the best for my needs.I live in Portugal, with same timezone as London. At the moment I am teaching (my background is academic life), but given the difficulties on getting a real "contract" on Universities in Portugal, I am planning to change my life. As I stick to my commitments, I would only be able to work full time on next September.How likely would Overleaf be interested, given my background? I can send a full CV, but it is prepared for academic purposes, with the list of all publications and other stuff that usually are not relevant to industry.Would love to exchange some ideas on collaboration possibilities.Best,
Alberto

      I stopped the application process because of the last question... " Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers...."
                      
                  
      I'm not affiliated in any way with the grand-parent company but IMO this fizzbuzz is a fair exercise for the position of "Experienced Software Engineer" and that'll get your application reviewed by a real person.
