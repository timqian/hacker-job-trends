Open Whisper Systems â€¢ San Francisco â€¢ Full Time â€¢ ONSITEOpen Whisper Systems is making private communication simple. Our technology is used by hundreds of millions of people, and everything we produce is open source. What it's like to work with us: https://whispersystems.org/workworkwork/â€¢ iOS Front End -- Someone intimately familiar with iOS development and internals, who has an appreciation for the craft of software development and experience with making decisions that result in great products. No experience with cryptography necessary, just solid experience developing for iOS and an eye for good design.â€¢ Android Developer -- Is the pleasure center of your brain directly wired to the experience of a slick UX or a nice animation? Do you hunt down memory leaks and StrictMode violations for fun? We're looking for someone with deep knowledge of the Android framework and an equally strong intuition for pairing beautiful app experiences with beautiful code. You'll be the architect of major features, making your code available to the world. You don't need to be a security expert; it's knowing how to make complicated systems simple to use that's at the heart of what we do.â€¢ Mobile UI / Product Designer -- Weâ€™re seeking an original thinker with strong visual design skills ready to help make private communication simple. You'll take on developing the look and feel of Signal on iOS, Android, and the desktop. Youâ€™ll be responsible for updating the visual design for the app and helping shape consistent guidelines to communicate a compelling user story across our products and other touchpoints. Youâ€™ll work closely with a team of engineers with a passion for making usable software. No experience with cryptography necessary, just intuition for what makes a great product and solid experience designing products that are a joy to use.See more at https://whispersystems.org/workworkwork/, or send us a note at workwithus@whispersystems.org
                      
                  
      Not sure if inappropriate, but a personal vouch for these guys. Anyone with the skills they are looking for and passion in the security/privacy space, should definitely apply. Whisper Systems and Moxie have incredible principles, brilliant products, and serve the greater good of all of us.
                      
                  
      So, I don't work there, but I was just drinking with someone at Open Whisper Systems, and they badly need someone in SFBA to take over iOS and mobile UX and to oversee design.Whisper makes Signal and TextSecure for iOS and Android respectively. They're the the best-designed, most trustworthy message crypto available to users today, and one of the only reasons they aren't the global default is that someone needs to take over their front-end and make them the default.Whisper will pay you less than almost any other company in the Bay Area (they're entirely self-funded) but you'll probably do more good there than you could at any company on this hiring thread, and if you succeed at the job, you'll be an authentic hero for privacy and civil liberties. That's not a bad calling card to have paper-clipped to your resume.You don't need to be a cryptography expert to talk to them. Also: they're all just fantastic people, some of the best you can hope to work with.https://whispersystems.org/workworkwork/I have no relationship with Whisper; I'm just an admirer.
                      
                  
      Several months ago when I was looking for a job I offered my services replying to a hiring thread email address.  They never replied.I live in SF, have 5+ years of iOS experience and worked at a chat company making their iOS chat interface for the last 4 years of it.It came with a TN visa condition,  but I doubt that is the reason why.  TN visas have no waiting period, are pretty much a rubber stamp and $3000 in lawyer fees.I got another job :/
                      
                  
      They didn't respond to my application either.
                      
                  
      Startups are really bad about this.  I'm 1 for 4 on getting replies from YC companies recently.  One is leaving me hanging after a full day coding project + an interview that (I think!) went really well.Just gotta keep trying.  It's a numbers game.Having been on the other side of the equation and been bad about keeping tabs on applicants in addition to my normal duties, I can't help but feel it's somewhat karma-related, too.  :)  In small companies, I figure it's generally due to not having people dedicated to sourcing/hiring so things just get overlooked.
                      
                  
      If there was ever a team you'd want to give the benefit of the doubt to on stuff like this, it's Moxie's.
                      
                  
      The next time you have a beer with these guys, you might want to ask them if they're serious about hiring.
                      
                  
      Also a big admirer of Whisper. They need people who can build software that doesn't suck, not crypto nerds.In addition, you get to work with Moxie who's one of the most badass engineers I've ever met. Sometimes you just wanna work with smart people on good problems, and that's where Whisper is playing.

      Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Dataquest.Vik is a great guy. One of his blog posts made it to the front page of HN a few months ago. I liked what he had to say, so I reached out to him for advice.Not only was he willing to take time out of his busy schedule meet up with me for coffee to talk over my situation, but he also put me in touch with 2 or 3 of his close friends who were kind enough to share their perspectives with me as well. All for a random guy in college who was confused and looking for someone to talk to.People like Vik make the HN community great, and I'm sure Dataquest will do great things with Vik in charge.

      Wow a job posting from a company that's been around for more than 8 years! (It was founded in 1876 in the form of the National League.)
                      
                  
      Technically this is a spin-off that is less than a year old in its current incarnation.
                      
                  
      We actually haven't been spun off quite yet.  It was approved by the owners a few months ago, but we are still currently part of MLB.
                      
                  
      Y Combinator is hiring hackers (San Francisco, ONSITE)We have a small team that makes the software that runs YC. Hardly any investors write software, but YC was started by hackers so it's natural for us to solve our problems that way.The YC software is used by a relatively small number of peopleâ€”mostly the YC partners and foundersâ€”but the users are sufficiently important that through them we are able to have huge leverage. YC has ambitious plans to create more innovation in the world, and the only way to reach that level of impact is to scale through software.We're looking for a couple of great hackers to join us. It's not a job for everyone, but it could be a good fit for someone who likes startups.

I expect youâ€™ve heard of JPMorgan at some point, but probably arenâ€™t familiar with Athena. Weâ€™re the bankâ€™s in-house platform for cross-asset pricing, risk management, trade management, e-trading, etc.. Thereâ€™s a core division (cleverly named â€œAthena Coreâ€�) of about 150 engineers which builds a platform and development libraries that are then used by over 5,000 developers throughout the bank.
The Core Analytics team currently has 8 members and is responsible for extending Athena to research teams and for reducing the gap between research and production use. To give a simplified example, our typical customer is a quant who might be attempting to create a new pricing model. Core Analytics would help him access relevant data sets, explore that data with a library of common statistical functions to, verify the new model with a back-testing framework, and then finally publish the model to production.
Python and C++ are the primary languages, but weâ€™re open to considering exceptional developers with any background. Finance experience is certainly not required. Our two main offices are in NYC and London; we also have satellites in Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Singapore.Email Christine.h.ko@jpmchase.com to apply.

      It would be good to see offers specify whether they respect the 8-hour workday or not.This to me is the primary concern when working for someone else and the best "perk" that is out there. If I'm expected to do unpaid overtime, I'm not interested no matter what the salary is or other details.
                      
                  
      You are in the wrong industry.
                      
                  
      I don't see how this comment can be true. I have worked for a few big name companies that did not require engineers to work for more than 8 hours per day. In fact, most of my teammates used to work between 4-7 hours per day. These companies did not provide extra money for overtime work but it did provide compensation-off for overtime work, i.e. if I worked say 12 hours on two different days, I could take one day paid leave for free.
                      
                  
      You work for the wrong companies.

      Planet Labs -- http://planet.com/ -- San Francisco, CA(Remote work depends on the role -- some are onsite only, others may be available to remote workers.)Planet Labs has a large number of positions open. We're a collection of electrical, mechanical, aerospace, software, science, etc. folks looking to image the whole planet on a daily basis with a large number of small satellites. It's a terrific bunch of folks doing what we call "agile aerospace".I've personally been with the company for over a year, working on "Mission Control", an internal web app for managing the satellites and make life easier on our "Spaceship Captains" -- the operators who manage them. This is definitely one of the most interesting and fun roles I've had in my career (and I've had a few).Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects. We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software. Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, dev ops, site reliability engineers, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we're growing.Full list of jobs at https://www.planet.com/careers/#openings
                      
                  
      Hi, I applied for one of Planet's open positions a few weeks ago, and I've been trying to get in contact with someone. The phone number for the SF office goes straight to voicemail. What's the best way to contact the appropriate person for a software position?
                      
                  
      Applying via the website is the best and only way. We've been updating our tooling and process with the aim of being better about responding moving forward, but it goes with pretty much any company -- even if it doesn't work out with one position, there will be others and it can make sense to keep looking and keep trying.  The larger the company, the more likely for this to be the case.
                      
                  
      Why did Chris (the CTO) leave? Was he fired?
                      
                  
      Wow, this project just sounds fun. I'm already pursuing my own projects, but otherwise this sounds like an intriguing idea. Best of luck!
                      
                  
      It is fun. Thanks!
                      
                  
      Do you offer visa support for berlin position?
                      
                  
      I'll check, but in general if a company is hiring you to work in a specific office/locale, then they're likely willing to help with the process of being employed and employable there.
                      
                  
      Applied here for internship, got a coding challenge, completed it, but haven't heard back yet, what does this mean?
                      
                  
      Really hard to say.  Could be a number of things from the engineer reviewing the code being swamped to the coding sample not being strong enough to needing more time.  If it's been a few days, it's ok to send in a nice email to the recruiter, even something simple like"Hi! Just wanted to check if you received my coding sample and if there's any feedback. Thanks so much!"
                      
                  
      sorry for the late reply, but I never got an email from a recruiter, just a link to a coding challenge
                      
                  
      likewise, still waiting on a response. Probably rejected, but would be nice to be emailed about it.
                      
                  
      Understood.  I'm an engineer at the company, not a recruiter, but I'll pass the word along.  Either way, thanks for the feedback and sorry for the inconvenience.  A "no" response is better than no response.
                      
                  
      Just saw this - 
Thanks! For what it's worth, I think the team there does some really neat things with the doves. Not sure HN'll allow you to amend the post to include an INTERN keyword, but you should add it in subsequent whoishiring's. :)

      University of Michigan | Ann Arbor | Full-time | OnsiteThis may be the only "Who's Hiring?" posting this month (possibly ever?) that offers the opportunity to work directly with brain surgeons in an operating room. The Neurosurgery Department at the University of Michigan is hiring for a unique position in a lab developing tools to distinguish cancerous tissue during surgery. The HR-sanitized posting of the position is here:http://umjobs.org/job_detail/117286/research_laboratory_spec......but we are really looking for someone with a software passion who wants to gain experience in a biomedical environment, perhaps as a pathway to graduate studies or medical school. A C++ background would be ideal, but any numerical computing  (Python/NumPy, MATLAB, R, Julia) or functional (Ocaml, Haskell, Scala, Clojure/Incanter, any Lisp...) programming experience is a plus. Experience developing in any of OpenCV, ITK, VTK, Point Cloud Library, or ImageJ would also be a plus as the position will  include microscopy, image analysis, and surgical navigation (look up "BrainLab" or "Medtronic StealthStation" to see what this looks like). At least initially, it will also require some hands-on wet-lab work (training will be provided -- the listed lab experience is negotiable). Above all, we are looking for intense curiosity and a willingness to get your hands dirty with software, hardware, and wetware.I am the lab PI, and I was referred to this board by a friend who said he frequently sees HN posts asking about getting in to the biomedical field with a CS background. This job provides such an opportunity. We are a small, young, and ambitious clinical-translational lab with an extremely productive (multiple publications in a Science journal) collaboration with one of the top spectroscopy groups in the world. Do note that this is an academic lab position, so we can't offer anywhere near Bay Area salaries. (but Ann Arbor's QoL/CoL ratio is absolutely fantastic!)

      Do you really mean "US Citizens only", which can be legally problematic in some cases I believe, or "people with legal authorization to work in the US for any employer"?  Unless you are doing something with the USG or which falls under ITAR you almost certainly mean the latter -- don't want to exclude good candidates who have green cards/permanent residency, etc.
                      
                  
      >REMOTE, Anywhere BUT must have legal right to work in USMaybe you should change BUT to AND. It seems contradictory otherwise, given the REMOTE, Anywhere.
                      
                  
      This is most definitely _not_ illegal if US citizenship is required to perform the job, which is the case in any job dealing with classified information.
                      
                  
      Or export restricted things like anything covered by ITAR, which is not always classified.
                      
                  
      My understanding is only US citizens can go through certain clearance/background checks required by our clients. Although perhaps it's just folks with a valid right-to-work? I don't know for certain, I'll amend it to be "valid right to work in US" and clarify for clearance reasons.
                      
                  
      If they need a clearance, then in all but very, very limited circumstances they must be US citizens.
                      
                  
      Some sensitive industries like defense will DEF require citizenship for getting immediate clearance OR future scenarios where you'll need a clearance

Our team has the technical expertise across stack to implement our models at scale, and we are looking to add an expert front-end developer to the team to help us design and develop a stunning front-end that will allow our customers to discover novel insights about their customers, develop marketing interventions around CLV, and track the results of those actions.Candidates should be comfortable with a major JS framework such as React/Angular and a visualization library such as d3. Candidates should also have a strong sense for UI/UX.The key challenges that you will face are:-Presenting a new metric: Predictive CLV is a new metric that has never been accessible before. The success of its penetration depends critically on effective communication to our clients.-Visualization of massive data sets: We need to present output from millions of customers and billions of transactions in an elegant and simple-to-understand fashion.-Design for different stakeholders: We need dashboards and visualizations appropriate for a range of audiences from performance marketers to the C-suite.Please email justin@clvmetrics.com to apply.

      This is the third booking.com comment in this thread. Maybe a little excessive?
                      
                  
      Based on the account ages/activity/postings, it looks like a lack of coordination between different departments/recruiters in the company rather than being intentional.  Curious how the mods will handle this.
                      
                  
      Actually this has more to do with the referral bonuses and the speed at which postings happen on the Who is hiring thread. I think two of the postings were from individuals and one was from the recruitment team. I downvoted the duplicate posts.I work at Booking.com and often post on these threads. Stayed away this time after seeing the existing posts.
                      
                  
      Interesting, thanks.  Internal competition. :)

      Nava | Washington DC* | Experienced full-stack developers/devops/product manager/operations | On-site - Full-timeWe're a small team of engineers and designers from Silicon Valley that came out to DC last year to help fix Healthcare.gov. It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to fix, and itâ€™s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.Our revamped Healthcare.gov application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. The login system we rebuilt is about two orders of magnitude more reliable and two orders of magnitude less expensive; for example, itâ€™s about $70M less per year to operate.People die because the Veteran's Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures. [0]
Thatâ€™s not because thereâ€™s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right. These are complicated legacy systems and processes, and there are very few people with modern tech industry experience who are aware of these problems and willing to help fix them. You can help change that.Our team is about a dozen people (Stanford, Google, Khan Academy, Dropbox, YC alums), and we plan to bring on a few people every month through 2015.Weâ€™re looking for:
* experienced full-stack engineers
* experienced devops engineers
* a product manager with a technical background
* a hyper-resourceful operations personWe have a social mission (we just incorporated as a public benefit corporation), but we pay market compensation (above market, for DC) and equity 
(above market).If you'd like to build software and infrastructure that radically improves how our government serves people, weâ€™d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.comLearn more about us: http://navahq.com

      Full-stack Software Engineer - Easel TV - Full time in Central London, UKEasel TV's philosophy is that the television is special; it's not just another device that's now available with a web browser, it has a unique context in our homes. We seek to exploit that special role by delivering a relevant and potentially personalised televisual experience from our cloud-based software-as-a-service platform, Suggested TV. Whilst we use web technologies, the user experience that we deliver is more like a TV channel than a web site or a mobile app. We provide our clients with editorial tools to allow them to control the user experience and powerful analytics to help guide those choices.
We have been around for over 5 years now however it still feels a lot like a start-up (and in many ways it is). From a technical point of view, there's a big roadmap of exciting and challenging work ahead of us.
Our tech: - Scala, Akka, Play Framework - Neo4J, SQL - Git, BitBucket, Jira, HipChat, Jenkins - Cloud infrastructure on AWS and AzureSkills & Requirements: - You have solid Java skills and some functional programming experience, preferably with Scala. - You are a great web developer.  - You are familiar with agile development and continuous deployment methodologies.  - You have experience and the scars to prove it. - You are a great team player. - You always feel responsible and want to deliver the best you can.
