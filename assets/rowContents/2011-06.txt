Pune, India - we are looking for guys/girls who are smart and get things done. (Please forgive the double post, didn't expect to see two separate who's hiring threads.)2 weeks ago I quit my job in NY to work on my new startup, Styloot (name still a work in progress). Our goal is to build a search engine for fashion. We have a nice office in Model Colony. Currently we are 10 people (CEO, CTO, adviser, web designer, 6 content creators), with lots of work to be done and not enough of us to go around.We have room for all sorts of people - our main focus right now is on design/user experience, web development and machine learning.We care a lot about attitude - if you want to build your own startup someday, we probably want to talk to you. We care far less about grades, whether you went to IIT, or whether you've used django before.Why you should work for us: you'll work very hard on difficult problems, you'll be a vastly better developer/designer when you are finished, and you might even become very rich.Contact info is in my profile.
                      
                  
      Congrats on the new gig, and hope the (dramatic) move went well for you. You're a smart guy and I'm mildly jealous of anyone who gets to work with you. Good luck!
                      
                  
      Thanks Tom. Though I should say, both to reply to your "a smart guy" crack and to further advertise the position, I'm actually the dumb guy in this group.
                      
                  
      Your office is in Model Colony, Pune!?!?!I'm not looking for a job, but I will get in touch when I'm next in my hometown (5-16 December). Would love to meet you!

      My really good friend just sent you an email about this yesterday I believe.  Just wanted to let you know (he found out about it through me, and I found out about it on here)
                      
                  
      Really REMOTE. You don't even have to be in the USA.deviantART (http://www.deviantart.com) wants developers. We're fully remote; there's no central office with a devteam located there. We expect all hires to be comfortable working in PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL; we like our developers to be able to hack on any part of the site, rather than being frontend/backend specialists.One exception to all that: there's an Infrastructure Engineer position which is located in Vancouver. It's C++/Java focused, and involves developing backend services used by the rest of the site.We post information about our development process here sometimes: http://dt.deviantart.com/blog/Apply here: http://deviantart.theresumator.com/apply
                      
                  
      P.S. I know we post a notice like this every month, but it's because we're doing ongoing hiring.
                      
                  
      Oh boy. I suggest you google a little bit before making accusations such as this one. DeviantART is a well known site, they definitely don't need to spam comment threads to get attention.
And no, I'm not in any way affiliated with deviantART, apart from being an occasional visitor.
                      
                  
      Oh yes, the HN hiring threads are really a great spamming location. We have to do this to promote our totally unknown site. :P(You might be being sarcastic, but I don't quite get that vibe from the "please stop it".)

      Yammer is hiring in San Francisco. We're one block away from the Caltrain station.What do we do? Yammer helps turn the mayhem of the corporate world into return-on-investment butterflies and leveraged-employee-engagement unicorns. Really, we make a product that enables companies to have a private social network. It helps people do their jobs, and our users legitimately love our product.We are a medium sized start-up that is battling several big enterprise software companies in this space. So yes, our target customers are in the enterprise space but we are turning this space upside down with our viral approach and how we build solutions for the user (which doesnâ€™t include an army of salesmen). We are solving consumer type problems but also monetize like enterprise software. (i.e. real revenues with fewer users)What's in it for you?- Amazing group of smart engineers to work with. (Sounds cliche, but we really do have smart people here :D)- Ability to have influence without authority. Yammer is a product-focused and user-focused organization. Everything we do revolves around that. - We hack in Ruby/Rails, Scala/Java, JS/JQuery/Node.js/Adobe AIR, Obj-C for iOS, and some MSFT stuff for Sharepoint I don't know too much about. You'll probably find something you want to work on.- Good catered lunch and dinner daily, with a 3PM snack cart. (Really.)- Fancy Apple hardware of your choice (you can have a PC if you really want one.)- Our engineers can outdrink anyone.- Top of the market compensation.Check out this blog post written by another one of our engineers: http://eng.yammer.com/blog/2011/5/31/shameless-recruiting.ht...All our open positions (engineering and otherwise) are here: https://www.yammer.com/about/jobs.If you send me your resume, I'll make sure the correct person sees it. bkudria@yammer-inc.com(Note: we also offer generous referral fees.

      Our engineers can outdrink anyone.That sounds like a challenge. :D You think you can outdrink Grooveshark?
                      
                  
      Definitely. When we win, we get to steal one of your engineers. Our choice.
                      
                  
      As the author of said blog post, I'd like to reiterate Yammer's awesomeness.

      Londsdaleite futures, actually: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonsdaleite :)I was originally talking about trying to get currently profitable trading strategies out of the same pieces of accounting information that millions of smart competitors have access to.  It's definitely a bit of a Red Queen's race ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queens_race ) trying to find and clean up new data sources and improve our trading methods well enough just to stay current. It's also hard because even though there's lots of data available, it's hard to tell how useful the early data is and whether you can still make money with trading strategies based on it.
                      
                  
      Very interesting. I guess though that there is little data that the rest of the world _doesn't_ have right?Btw, The wikipedia link should be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queens_race
                      
                  
      That's interesting -- it looks like news.arc automatically removed the "%27" from both of our URL submissions, maybe as an over-zealous anti-spam precaution.
                      
                  
      Ha - so it did! I didn't check, assumed was good :)
                      
                  
      If you don't mind me asking... If someone were already a good programmer, what is the baseline financial/statistical knowledge?

      Is "kicking the shit out of the 4:20 attitude" some sort of reference to marijuana usage? I'm not at all familiar with this turn of phrase.
                      
                  
      Being that they're from Vancouver I think it would be. 
The only way to be more sure is if they were from Nelson.

We recently raised our B round, led by Crosslink Capital, the investors behind Pandora.We are looking for test-driven engineers (and sysadmins) to work on an internet-scale video processing pipeline using Python, MySQL, Selenium, ffmpeg and other open source tools. Its goal is to find and ingest videos from web pages and to generate and store metadata about those videos using our vision algorithms written in C++.You aren't expected to have a background in computer vision, but it would be great if you are interested in learning more about it. We are building a cross-functional team, so you will work closely with our computer vision experts to plan new capabilities and bring them into production.
We are also looking for computer vision experts who feel the need as we do to build an engine that can watch and understand all of the world's video. This is truly the greatest AI problem as there is no more quintessentially human activity than watching TV.No remote hires, please. You must be willing to work at our office five days a week in a pair programming environment.If interested, please contact me (founder/ CTO) at bobby@affinesystems.com

Iâ€™ve worked in AWS for the past year and Iâ€™ve learned more in that time than I thought possible. Iâ€™m an infrastructure person at heart, and at other companies Iâ€™ve worked for, Iâ€™m always torn between doing the deep engineering that I love, or working on a more customer focused product. In AWS, they are one and the same. I like having scalability, availability, and performance as core features of the product Iâ€™m building. Another thing I love about working in AWS is the impact your work has - your service is used by thousands of developers, and those developers use your service in ways you never imagined, which are then used by millions of people.Detailed job descriptions :https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/133388/job

      Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Since December 2010, when Route 53 launched, we have been working hard to add new features (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2582674), make the service easy to use, and scale our systems.

      Are we going to do a "Who is Hiring?" for remote positions this month?
                      
                  
      I think they are combined into one.  This post is asking for the keyword REMOTE, search that to find remote positions.
                      
                  
      Not everyone is specifying remote or not, though. :(
                      
                  
      I guess you can assume not-remote if it doesn't say remote. If everyone who didn't allow remote were to specify "no remote" then it'd just mess with the folks who were searching for "remote", because it would also find "not-remote" and the folks searching for "remote" would get frustrated.Whoops, this post could be annoying for those searching for "remote", couldn't it? I'll stop saying "remote" now. Sorry for saying "remote" so much.
