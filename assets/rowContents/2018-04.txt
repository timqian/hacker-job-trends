      What the hell is a headline, the email subject line? And why is this a Gmail address?
                      
                  
      I'd assume it refers to the email subject line, and it's likely a Gmail because these quant funds are notoriously secretive and secure. It's legitimate nonetheless.

Contact us If you are bright, like to be surrounded by smart people, enjoy challenges, and need to see projects through to the end!! We are seeking great software engineers who are interested in solving problems of scale within an increasingly competitive retail landscape.As a mid to senior engineer, we would like for you to have a good working knowledge of at least one JVM language (preferably Java or Scala). Junior candidates can code in any language (though Haskell would be impressive :) ). Get in touch at wmlabs.dc@gmail.com
                      
                  
      Why do you use a gmail address for your contact info?
                      
                  
      Because I get lots of spam if I use my corporate email. If your resume looks good I will reply to you from  my Walmart account. It's not the first time I posted the job here, we actually hired two people from HN.

      Please someone report this post! It's fake!
                      
                  
      Actually. I have been with the team for over 2 years and a hacker news member for what feels like ten years. The reason I don't put my actual Walmart email is because of all the spam I actually get. If you are actually interested. Shoot me an email and I will reply from my Walmart email.
                      
                  
      Might be a good idea to setup an email at your work dedicated solely for receiving job applications.
                      
                  
      Good idea, although we do have our own recruiting team that has emails created for that purpose, but I am not part of that team. I am a software engineer who is looking for new awesome peeps to work with :) (I was also hoping my Karma + longevity in hacker news would give me some cred, but I guess that didn't work hah)
                      
                  
      The hnofficehours link in your profile is dead FYI.

We do custom engineering work like platforms that power Swiss cities.- We are finishing building a SaaS product for Yoga studios in Zurich that can be adjusted to other local businesses with a few clicks, meaning that you can adjust it for the needs of hairdressers also without having to code.

      â€œGerman language neededâ€�. That seems to severely restrict your application pool right?
                      
                  
      Think the German language requirement is only for the PM.> we hire English speakers for technical roles.

      Folks - the 2nd link for VSC (https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/390321/Software-Engi...) is incorrect.  Can't edit the post unfortunately.The short job description is for a dev to work directly on the Python extension for VSC (ie Editor, Debugger, Intellisense, Data Science features, REPL, ...).

      Hey, what does "FULL-TIME ONSITE+REMOTE VISA" mean exactly?Does that mean a fully remote position is an option or that you'd include a person in your team that'd be working from some other existing Microsoft office?

      We do hire interns but we don't have a regular (e.g. summer) internship program. Interns are hired when we have a space and usually stay until graduation. Right now we have interns so it's unlikely we'll have new intern positions until, at least, the end of this year. If you're interested I would sign up for USAjobs.gov and create a notification for engineering internship positions. You can see a list of our current open positions [1] on USAjobs.gov as well.[1] https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/?k=defense%20microelectronics...

      Would you be interested in hiring new grads?If it matters, I'll be doing my last internship with the silicon & graphics team in OneCore this summer and I have some past internship and personal (mostly homebrew) experience writing low-level software albeit most of it wasn't performance-critical.
                      
                  
      > Would you be interested in hiring new grads?Those are rough characteristics we think we'd see in successful candidates. Happy to make exceptions for the "right person", but it's hard to say w/out seeing a resume. If you're passionate about working on JS runtimes, then please reach out, we'd love to hear from you.For new grads and/or intern positions at Microsoft, the easiest thing is to go through your university recruiting center, and schedule interviews as early in the fall as possible.  Microsoft hires lots (1000s?) of college students & interns every year.

      Coâ€”Star Astrology | Software Developer | Full-time, On-site in Brooklyn, NY | https://www.costarastrology.com/Co-Star is a mobile application combining traditional methods of astrology with NASA data and modern technology to create a branded, hyper-personalized and social astrology experience. Nearly half of millennials believe in astrology â€“ and that number continues to rise as more people are searching for meaning, connection, and community across all aspects of their lives. Since launch in October 2017, Co-Star has grown incredibly quickly and was ranked in Apple's top 100 entertainment app weeks after launch. We are an early stage startup (we just raised a seed round of funding) looking to expand the team as we continue to gain traction and develop the app!Some of the technologies we use include  - Haskell (our whole web api is written in this!)
  - Swift 
  - Python (we use AWS Lambda to wrap python libraries we donâ€™t want to port to Haskell) 
  - React + TypeScript 

We are looking for a full stack developer who is familiar with at least one of Haskell, Swift, or AWS and is open to learning the others! We love types at Coâ€”Star, and a passion for statically verifying code is definitely a plus!There are currently three of us (founders) working on this. Youâ€™ll be our first hire, so youâ€™ll have a big say in what we do and how we do it.Contact jobs@costarastrology.com
                      
                  
      How does the astrology bit actually work?
                      
                  
        import System.Random (randomRIO)
 
  pick :: [a] -> IO a
  pick xs = fmap (xs !!) $ randomRIO (0, length xs - 1)
 
  main = do
    x <- pick lifeAdvice
    print x
                      
                  
      If you are only familiar with Sun sign astrology, you would probably be surprised at how mathematical and complicated astrology actually is. Though canned astrology often disappoints me, it at least doesn't tell you that you are going to have the same events as millions of others born within the same 30 day period.
                      
                  
      We start by using NASA data to get the precise positions of the planets. Then we assign semantic meaning to these raw data points using the rules of astrology (i.e what significance the Moon has, what the different signs mean, etc). And lastly, we combine them together into human readable text which we show to the user.
                      
                  
      Which astrology rules are you using? Greek or Indian? I have done some preliminary research into Indian astrology and it have amazed me at times on how accurate it is. Though most of the HN crowd can think I am stupid, even I thought astrology is stupid until I stumbled on few things and I applied the same rules to my friends life to predict their good and rough patches fairly accurately. The data set is very small to call it a scientific study, but I am planning to run the rules on a large data set to figure out the possibilities of it.Great to see someone having a successful business with astrology. Good luck
                      
                  
      Same as someone selling a religious app or any other entertainment app.The only issue I have is when people take astrology too seriously. I hope youâ€™re putting some sort of an â€œ*â€� that itâ€™s for entertainment purposes and people shouldnâ€™t make serious life decisions on what you say.
                      
                  
      Okay this is ridiculous. Great idea using science to advertise you shitty app.

      Worldwide, REMOTE, full time or part time -- 100% flexibility. $70-100/hr. Expert Interviewer at Karat (https://karat.io)Work from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else the training/time investment doesn't make as much sense from your end or ours. When each interview is done, you're done.I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We've done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we're well-funded and growing quickly as a result.Because of this quickly-growing demand, we're looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you're strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather's like.The application form is here: https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...I know it's a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I'm happy to talk through any of it.
                      
                  
      I had interview through this company. They gave the company I applied to the bad recommendation. But the thing is:* Interviewer has less experience than me and wasn't able to understand some concepts.* Interviewer has no experience with the language I was using (and interviewing for).* I solved all the challenges and answered all the questions, but the decision was no-go, for some reason (they don't provide feedback).* I may be wrong here, but they also did recording without my consent. They should ask "Are you ok with recording?". Instead, they just record and violate California recording laws which require consent by both parties.I think they did very poor job (however, I admit I am biased here). You need to be extra careful interviewing with them. There are some signs that their process is not organized and things don't work very well.
                      
                  
      Hey, sorry to hear you had a bad time. Candidate experience is something I personally spend a lot of time on, so it's always disappointing to hear someone wasn't pleased with their interview. As someone who's had terrible interview experiences in the past, part of why I work here is that I think we can give a better experience to candidates than they get in just about any regular interview.Anyway, I'd love to dive into the specifics if you want to shoot me an email. I understand if you're not comfortable doing that, but a lot of what you're describing sounds inconsistent with our normal process, so I want to see what went wrong. Even if we didn't actually screw any of this up, there's still a good chance we communicated in a way where you left feeling that we did. Either way, I'd like to fix it.
                      
                  
      Never got passed registration: Unrecognized email domain
                      
                  
      This company was here before, I was interested so I applied, filled in the form. Never heard back.
                      
                  
      Could you email me? I'll check on your application internally.
                      
                  
      Same. Applied, no response. Industry standard :)
I really enjoy interviews (on both sides) so thought it'd be fun topping to my day.
                      
                  
      Could you please email me as well? Will look into this, and figure out if there's some systematic reason for why we're missing applications.
                      
                  
      The time flexibility, coupled with remote-work, is a lovely idea. I hope it spreads.
                      
                  
      Thank you! :)
                      
                  
      That actually sounds fun.
                      
                  
      It is :) I work on the internal team now, but was interviewing for about a year in 2016 while working on my own business. If you have any questions about what interviewing is like I'm happy to answer!
                      
                  
      Can you describe the process of assigning interviews to interviewers and the process of choosing times for the interview sessions?If I wanted to set aside a time period of say, 8 contiguous hours every week, during which I wanted to do as many interviews as possible, how many could I expect to be able to fit in?
                      
                  
      Sure! Basically: You put availability on your calendar; we book interviews into that availability. (When candidates schedule, we show them aggregated availability across all eligible interviewers.)You could do roughly 5 interviews in 8 hours if you account for breaks and everything. It's possible to do more than that, but I'd say that's the happy fill rate. I've done more than that and it starts to be excessive.
                      
                  
      Really nice. I'm a founder nowadays on the hiring point, but I kinda wanna give it a try :-)

Our customers depend on us to keep their systems up-to-date and secure, so we would depend on you to make sure our systems stay running and secure.Ksplice has a rich infrastructure that utilizes virtualization heavily, and we are looking for somebody who can help us take that infrastructure and modernize it. While some day-to-day system administration will be required, this is primarily a development role. As such, strong programming skills and an understanding of how to automate system tasks are required. Ksplice primarily uses Python, so experience with that is preferred, but experience with any similar language to perform system administration automation is acceptable.The Oracle Ksplice team is a remote team, so you must be comfortable interacting remotely and working autonomously. We are a small team that expects its members to be comfortable with self-directed work. We

Email me if you're interested: fahim@adquick.comAbout AdQuick* Founded by ex-Instacart engineers/marketing 
* Raised $3M led by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan & Alexis Ohanian, Reddit co-founder). 
* Our customers include great brands such as: Kevin Hart, Peloton, FanDuel, Drake, Lyft & more.Technical Stack* Our tech stack is Rails 4, Webpack, React, Postgres, Heroku. 
* Looking for 3+ years experience in running production systems, ability to iterate quickly and sense of ownership. 
* Strong focus on user experience and putting the customer first.Technical Challenges* We have a complex frontend user interface. Users should be able to view 100,000+ markers and transit lines on a map without their browser crawling to a halt. We need to support complex and interesting map visualizations â€“ layering political voting data, Census data, Foursquare data and more.* We're a search company. AdQuick conducts a search every time the user pans the map. Searching by geography, demographics, AdQuick score and a myriad of other attributes from disparate data sources is computationally expensive. It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times and server costs low.* We're a data science company. We integrate with Google Analytics & AdWords and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior (CTR in a region). ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We'll use machine learning to create better campaigns overtime.* Our backend systems have to deal with a myriad of inventory CSV, PDF formats, requiring robust and fast file validations, normalization and ingestion systems.* We scraped Instagram and used image recognition to see if people shared photos of billboards. Turns out, a lot of people Instagram'd Drake's board. Innovative ROI tools are a core part of our offering.

      > Our Software Engineers benefit from a working environment that encourages them to produce excellent code with a customisable workstation, multiple monitors and an open plan office.I'm struggling to understand how an open plan office fits into this. Are the current employees happy with that? Given the choice, I would definitely get a real office with a door and enough silence to reason about code.
                      
                  
      There is a big debate about open plan, isn't there? I personally like working in a collaborative environment, at least within the scrum team all focussed on the same goals.I think Pico's layout is quite good in that hardware and software engineers share the same space, but it's separated from tech support (who are on the phone a lot) and marketing and the warehouse. Sometimes it gets noisy, but no more than any other open plan I've been in.If you come in for an interview, you'll get a tour of the building and can see whether our style is right for you :)

      PolyAI | London/Singapore | Onsite/RemotePolyAI is building the backend machinery to allow computers to have two-way conversations with people. If you've used Siri, you'll probably know that it's okay at handling single-sentence commands like "remind me to call Jane in 2 hours", but anything significantly more complicated - anything that requires a 2-way conversation to establish what you want - is much much more flakey and inconvenient. At PolyAI, we're building the first developer platform for making scalable, maintainable voice apps that rely on conversations, rather than just single-commands. This opens up the possibility of Alexa/Google Home skills for Deliveroo, Uber, Postmates etc that are actually convenient to use and "just work".We think this is the first step towards a future where voice interfaces are the de facto way of carrying out small to medium sized tasks.We're a small but fast growing team of 8 people, comprised of (really good!) NLP researchers, and software engineers with a bunch of startup experience behind us. We're healthily funded by Passion and Amadeus and pay competitively.We're looking for:* backend engineers
* machine learning/NLP engineersI just want to point out that while we are currently a team of all men, we are super keen to move away from that, and regularly introspect about whether there's anything about our culture that may in any way exclude non male candidates. Additionally, we are always open to feedback about anything we might be getting wrong here.Get in contact at angus@poly-ai.com
                      
                  
      Update: sorry to say that after some research internally we've come by some new information that means we are actually unable to support remote work for now, contrary to the ad above.
                      
                  
      Lots of YC companies | Software engineers of all kinds | Everywhere, though mostly in the US | Mostly on-site, but some remote too | Full-time and internA few months ago, a team of us at Y Combinator started working on a "common app", so that people could apply to all Y Combinator companies at the same time. It seemed silly to us that even though so many companies are struggling to hire people, it still requires O(n) effort to apply to n companies.So, we built https://workatastartup.com. It's a simple way to apply to all YC companies at the same time. It's only for software engineers & data scientists for now (we hope to open it more broadly later). If a company is interested, you'll get an email from them.  We also recently added a directory (https://workatastartup.com/directory) where you can browse the jobs of some of the companies hiring through the site and apply directly (not all have finished their profile yet).It seems to be working pretty well - many of the people who posted a profile have gotten more than a dozen company founders reaching out to them, and some people have gotten jobs through it already. That said, it's still a bit inconsistent and most likely to have good results if you're looking for a full-time role in the US.We'd love if you filled out a profile and let us know what you think (workatastartup@ycombinator.com) : https://www.workatastartup.com
                      
                  
      Based on the first line of this comment being "Software engineers of all kinds", would it be correct to conclude that this service is still limited only to software engineering (coding) jobs?
                      
                  
      Yes, it is for now.  We very much intend to expand to everyone - we're just trying to get it working really well for one group first.
                      
                  
      Considering this is only the second or third month that I recall it being advertised here, that makes some sense.However, what's the reasoning behind waiting for "really well" instead of just "better than the alternative" before opening it up to the minorities (at least the technical ones)?

      Great question biasforaction! Snap/insta is used primarily for broadcasting your life "at" people. Our new video format is all about talking "with" your friends. We use speech to text and NLP to embed what you say in the video, that way your friends always get the message. The result is fluid communication that flows as smooth as texting, but with the personality, character and connection that only video can offer. We've then built upon this foundation in clever ways to bring you closer together with the people in your life that matter the most.

      1bios | Senior Software Engineer | Truckee/Lake Tahoe, CA | FULL-TIME, ONSITE or REMOTE | hello+hn@1bios.coAbout 1bios:We provide a health management platform for healthcare providers and health insurers.  Our company is relatively young, and this position would get you in on the ground floor, positioning you to have real impact on our engineering decisions and company culture.Our stack:ruby, rails, javascript, typescript, react, mongo, postgres, thriftWhat we are looking for:Do you not only want to see a problem done, but see it done cleanly in a way that makes you proud?  Do you appreciate elegance, but despise implicitness and magic?  Is code and system design something you like to really think about before tackling a problem?  Do you like to discuss architecture with other engineers who care deeply about the quality of their code? Do you wish you were writing in a statically typed functional programming language a la Haskell, but are also satisfied applying those same concepts to more wild west contexts like Ruby and JS?  If this resonates with you, please get in touch!Email us at hello+hn@1bios.co
                      
                  
      Just FYI it's probably best not to mention highly desirable keywords like Haskell if you don't actually have that kind of work to offer.
                      
                  
      If you want to use Haskell's statically typed functional programming, why would you use a dynamically typed scripting language? Do you even know what that sentence means? Do you realize that you would have to reinvent a whole typing system to go from dynamic to static, but going from static to dynamic is a trivial exercise? You might get better applicants if you have a tech-savvy member of your team write your advertisements. You are posting on HN, not reddit. Furthermore, how is JS a "wildwest concept?" The point of JS is to have a scripting language supported inside lots of larger programs like web browsers. It is ubiquitous.Here I rewrote this for you:
Do you wish you were writing in a statically typed functional programming language a la Haskell, but are also satisfied wasting your time? If this resonates with you, please get in touch!

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsite 
Right now the market for educational software is a mess. Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing. Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.
At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. Weâ€™ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform. Our goals are much bigger than that, though. We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of about 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React. More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs !
