http://www.thumbtack.com/engineeringPlease reach out to (nate@)thumbtack.com with any questions.
                      
                  
      My personal understanding is that Thumbtack only wants candidates with Ivy League educations, and that they're dismissive of everyone else. I have heard they have difficulty filling their positions due to this. Is that accurate?
                      
                  
      Thumbtack engineer here, writing anonymously.Re: "Ivy League educations" -- I believe we have zero engineers from Ivy League proper undergrad, and a couple with grad degrees there.  If you include MIT/Stanford/CMU/Caltech/Berkeley we go up to 15/50, but the majority of eng is not from elite colleges.  We might have a bias for hiring from Google, I'm not sure how much of that bias is just that Google engineers tend to interview well.Re: "dismissive of some people, and have difficulty filling positions due to this": I agree that we have a selective hiring process which likely results in a substantial false negative rate.  The selectivity tends to be focused towards "ability to write code in an interview setting quite well."  I agree this is not all that correlated with the ability to produce good engineering work over a long period of time.
                      
                  
      Hey, I appreciate the reply. What I heard through the grapevine is that Thumbtack primarily wants Stanford grads. A very experienced friend had his resume dismissed out of hand because they didn't like his educational pedigree -- didn't even consider an interview. Meanwhile, the Thumbtack employee that had forwarded my friend for consideration told of constant pleas for referrals of "qualified programmers", and promises of exorbitant bonuses for people who could furnish them.After watching this happen, it was no wonder that Thumbtack was unable to fill their positions. There's a point where such baseless and flippant dismissal of good talent stops representing selectivity and begins instead to represent incompetence.The prior head of recruiting, who was employed by Facebook and Google before she was employed by Thumbtack, has been replaced since that incident, so perhaps things are better now.
                      
                  
      I can confirm. They have a very smug and elitist attitude. They also engage in some pretty shady business practices (just google them).
                      
                  
      I'm sorry you perceived some members of our team as smug and/or elitist.  While I don't feel like they're smug or elitist towards other engineers here, I don't know how they behave outside of work.I googled for "thumbtack shady business practices."  The top results were professionals complaining about 1)inability to buy a single lead at a time, and 2)bogus leads.  The first is specifically a measure to filter for more dedicated businesses;  regarding the second, there are multiple engineers and manual reviewers filtering out bogus leads and from what I can tell they do a solid job.Since you're likely coming from a technical pov, you may also consider the fact that our company gets a considerable fraction of traffic from SEO to be shady.  I agree that gaming SEO by itself is a silly thing to do.  Fortunately for me, optimizing for SEO is somewhat correlated to optimizing for quality content.  Additionally, at our company's current growth stage SEO is becoming somewhat less important than building a solid product;  this likewise makes me optimistic.

Epilepsy, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and other neurologic conditions affect one in six people worldwide. Without the ability to work collaboratively with this data in an integrated manner, and in the relevant context including links to metadata, teams of researchers and clinicians are prevented from making fundamental discoveries that advance the field toward better medicines, devices and care delivery approaches.

      I just started a month ago as a backend Django developer.  Itâ€™s a great team and the work is interesting.  Everyone is 100% remote and itâ€™s very flexible.  One of the co-founders previously co-founded oDesk/Upwork. If you have any questions feel free to message me directly.
                      
                  
      I don't really think the heritage of oDesk/Upwork is inspiring. How does that co-founder's experience impact the team's daily work?
                      
                  
      Mind saying which version of django is used?
                      
                  
      I'm also wondering this. It's definitely not the same to land on a django1.3 app or a a django1.9 app.Also, are you using python3? or python2?
                      
                  
      Exactly. I'm stuck maintaining a legacy Django 1.3 system and its not ideal. I'm using Django 1.9 for other systems and it makes me a bit sad to work with the older version. I'd happy maintain a legacy system but it gets harder as security fixes become non-existant.
                      
                  
      I just noticed that your Back-End Engineer position is set to Romania, and your DevOps to France. Is that correct? Does it make sense to apply to those as an American?
                      
                  
      is this us only remote position?

      OpenDataSoft | Paris, France (onsite) | Full-time
https://www.opendatasoft.com/company/jobs/We're a small 4-years-old company (21 employees at the moment, including 11 R&D engineers) building a SaaS platform to help governments and companies to share their data, ranging from the typical opendata platform to an internal sharing platform, and anything in between. Our product targets regular users, not technical users, and aims at making data publishing as easy as possible; we don't sell professional services and instead try to let our customers be as autonomous as possible with the product in a true SaaS fashion, sometimes by teaching them a few things in the process. We also try to make data exploration as easy as possible, in order to make open data reachable to any citizen or end-user.Our stack is basically a Django (Python) project, with a data processing framework pushing stuff into Elasticsearch, which is exposed through an API allowing filtering, querying, complex aggregations, and so on. On the front-end, a lot of AngularJS hitting this API and allowing users to dynamically filter and explore datavisualizations, and an administration interface trying to solve the big challenge of making data transformation and publishing as easy as possible.We are currently looking for:
- a front-end engineer, to work on the product's UI and data APIs (AngularJS, Python)
- a back-end engineer, to work on our data processing framework and on Elasticsearch (Python)You can contact us directly on jobs@opendatasoft.com, even just to share a coffee and talk a bit more about what we do and what you're looking for!

      Insikt- San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles
ONSITEInsikt (pronounced â€œin-seektâ€�) is a white label loan origination and investing platform that enables any brand to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios.Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow â€“ brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrowâ€™s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital â€” all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you donâ€™t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. Weâ€™ve launched â€œLending as a Serviceâ€� (LaaS) to power this transformation. We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. We are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations, and capital markets.We want passionate, fun-loving people who can contribute positively to our company and our culture. Let us know if this sounds like you. http://www.insikt.comTechnologies: front-end: angular, react back-end: java(finagle), node, groovy, postgres we run on AWS and we use chef for deployment.Beyond developers, we're also looking for product managers, business analysts, you name it!Shoot me a note at bernardo [at] with the subject "HN" and I'll connect you to the right person.

      Coatue Management | New York, NY | Infrastructure Engineer, Data Engineer | Fulltime | ONSITECoatue Management is a long/short equity hedge fund based in New York City. We focus on investments in the technology, media and telecommunications sectors and manage $10+ billion in assets on behalf of individuals, nonprofit organizations and institutional investors.Weâ€™re in the middle of building a market intelligence platform based on non-traditional data (ie. Non-financial data). We look for unique and creative sources of data (everything from e-commerce pricing to satellite data), use it to model key firm and economic metrics, and present it to investment staff.Weâ€™re seeking an engineer interested in taking a lead role in building a data pipeline and warehousing backend for datasets ingested from APIs, web scraping, remote databases, and purchased data feeds. You would help build systems for job scheduling, data anomaly/QA detection, process monitoring, and efficient storage/querying. Our current infrastructure uses Python, MySQL, and Docker but we are open to well thought out alternatives. The ideal candidate will have experience and opinions on database architecture and best practices when building high throughput data systems. This role offers the opportunity to take ownership of the architecture and offers technical freedom/creativity.Keyword skills: Data Engineer, Python, AWS, SQL, Docker, Redis, Redshift, SparkWe're always happy to talk to data scientists interested in creative ways of measuring the economy as well.Email us if you're interested or want to learn more: recruiting [at] coatue.com
                      
                  
      Nontraditional data is THE future of investing and engineers are best suited to find it. For instance, if you wanted to know who was spending the most to acquire users, wouldn't it make sense to get bid data from ad exchanges? If you wanted to know which were the most anticipated games of the year, wouldn't the Reddit API be the tool you'd use to check? And if you wanted to predict crop yields, wouldn't satellite data of crop fields be the most realtime way to see it? Traditional equity research doesn't do this - but we do and we've seen it work. We're building a system to systematize our capabilities.The scale of what we're trying accomplish is no easy feat - we handle realtime data at very high throughputs and analyze datasets > 1TB in an environment where accuracy and speed counts. Our output has a real impact on investment decisions.If this sounds interesting, email us!

Why Point B is so enticing in the first place is something we have yet to figure out.This should sound both exciting and terrifying at the same time.In practical terms, this means that you should feel that writing tests before writing code is The Right Way To Do Things. You should have strong opinions on technical issues, but also be able to work productively with the team even if they disagree with those opinions. And you should be excited at the idea of working in a balanced team, not just with other software engineers, but also with designers, marketers, and people of the sales persuasion.You will also need to be comfortable tackling hard problems that you only loosely understand, and be willing to treat every line of code that you write as part of a massive science project -- which means that you might have to throw that code away if the experiment doesn't pan out.I'm not going to lie: this is challenging work. But not a challenging work envrionment.We support each other as a team. If you need something -- a book, a tool, a training course -- we will make that happen.

      Iterable (https://iterable.com) - San Francisco, CACome join Iterable. We are 12 people bringing the growth hacking tools that consumer Internet companies like Twitter/Facebook build internally to other large-scale companies. We aim to build the best user growth engine on the planet. It's crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven't caught up to the 21st century.Our team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance/Twitter/Google, (we built large parts of Twitter's growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here. This is an opportunity to join a super-fast growing startup, in a huge market and with a great team, while it's still early.If you're interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:    - Scale our messaging API
    - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces 
    - Write software to build machine learned user models 
    - Make data visualizations for our email and user data 
    - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform
Some aspects of our culture that make us different:
  - We are all very focused on self improvement
  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want)
  - We are chill and empathetic people
  - The company is completely transparent
Technologies you'll work with:  - Scala
  - Elasticsearch
  - Postgres
  - Redis
  - AngularJS
  - Play Framework
  - RabbitMQ

      OpenSignal - London, UK (Full time, permanent)
At OpenSignal we're using mobile apps to tap into the smart phones we're all carrying around with us to build up global crowdsourced sensor networks. Our first sensor network is for wireless signal [1] where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible. Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch. We are hiring for a Full-stack Dev and a UX/UI Designer but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills. We're also backed by top-tier investors (we raised a $4million series A [4] from Qualcomm Ventures, O'Reilly Alphatech Ventures & Passion Capital).More info: http://opensignal.com/jobs/
