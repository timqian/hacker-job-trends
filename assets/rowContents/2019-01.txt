Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web | San Francisco | Onsite | FulltimeHappy New Year, Hacker News!Y Combinator has a small ~5 person team in San Francisco that builds all the software that runs YC.  We don't hire for this team very often, but we're looking to hire a couple of people now.Despite our small size, we're in charge of a number of important products.  We run the software that powers YC's application process, software that almost every investor in silicon valley uses (https://blog.ycombinator.com/investor-day-software/), and Bookface, a private community site that is very actively used by YC founders.  This year we launched two big new projects - Startup School (http://startupschool.com/) and Work at a Startup (http://workatastartup.com/).  Those new projects are going very well - we have over 26K founders signed up for Startup School - and we want to double down on them.An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners - from our dinner talks to demo day.  You'll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you'll get to know and learn from hundreds of companies.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point.We're looking for capable generalist engineers. We care mostly about your ability to write great software; we don't care if you've used the technologies we work with as long as you're willing to learn them.  We look for engineers with great product instincts who can own whole projects from start to finish.We also offer highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC's portfolio.

      I'm really curious how many applications you will receive on this position. What a super opportunity.Any data science or BI positions?Not currently but hopefully later this year!@jared, Do you sponsor visas?Some visas, depends on the details.  Email me with your visa situation and I'll let you know if we can help.While I'm someone else, I sent you an email :)United States Digital Service | Senior Software Engineers, Senior Site Reliability Engineers, Senior Designers, and more! | Washington, DC | ONSITE https://www.usds.gov/The best of technology. The best of government. And we want you. We're looking for the most tenacious designers, software engineers, product managers, and more, who are committed to untangling, rewiring and redesigning critical government services. You'll join a team of the most talented technologists from across the private sector and government. No government resume required! We work on some of the biggest issues affecting the American people there are, immigration, veterans service, students, health care, and more. We're especially looking for talented senior engineers to join us to help shift move government tech in the right direction.See one of our Reports to Congress for examples of what you could be working on:https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/07/Apply here:https://www.usds.gov/join
                      
                  
      If you'd like to get a feel for the sorts of folks we have at USDS, our Medium account is a pretty good place to start, too: https://medium.com/@USDigitalServiceWow this seems like a perfect opportunity, Matt. I hope that you are doing well.I presume green card holders are not hired either?We need U.S. citizens for the roles we have.It would help save a lot of time if OP added this important piece of information on their job posting.I have a GC and have applied for citizenship. Does than count?Are there specific clearances that applicants would be expected to obtain?How's the pay when the gov't is shut down?Not trying to be cheeky -- genuinely curious does the shut down affect the pay of those on this team?
                      
                  
      It depends on the team!  This shutdown, only two of our teams are affected -- the DHS Digital Service and the SBA Digital Service.  We work when our parent agencies work, and we shutdown with them for the most part.When furloughed, yes, we are not paid -- however, so far, Congress has always passed legislation to pay back employees who were furloughed.
                      
                  
      If only you guys were able to offer a relocation stipend or on-site outside of DC.  Upending your life to move to an expensive city for, at most, a 12 month commitment? No bueno.I'm not generally a fan of remote work so really what I'd like to see change is along the lines of: housing assistance, relocation stipend, a path to non-term-limited employment, and/or positions on-site outside of DC.(and that whole drug testing thing, but one step at a time)
                      
                  
      Just to address the "that's a lot of changes to make for a 12 month commitment" aspect, you can sign up for a two year term at USDS, which can be renewed, so you can work at USDS for up to four years if things are going well. We're just at the point where the first set of folks are reaching their four year mark.For folks who don't know, USDS salaries for digital service experts typically top out at the "GS 15 step 10" cap for government salaries, which is a little over $164,000/year.
                      
                  
      One of the ways I've looked at public vs private sector jobs is that you trade salary for stability and benefits (USDS is no exception).  So it's good to hear that there is a longer-term potential, and it would good to see the copy on your site updated as such.  The way it reads now seems like "that's a lot of changes to make for at most a 12 month commitment"Likewise the USDS site indicates that the TSP is a maybe.  That's a big negative any way you slice it.  Aside from being idealistic a government job is again about stability and predictability.  Some way of figuring out a way to ensure all USDS gigs are eligible for TSP would be a big comfort.  Either that or some sort of more clear indication about what sorts of jobs would or would not qualify.That said, topping out at $164k is about average in terms of base pay for the Bay Area (dunno how much cheaper DC is).  It's actually pretty disappointing to see that the comment about salary uncertainty get downvoted into oblivion.  Not everyone who wants to do good things in the world has the financial security to weather missing paychecks.It's unfortunate that trump and the republicans have brought such unprecedented instability to the federal government, but that's where we as a country are at right now.  Coming from the private sector world, I haven't worried about whether my paycheck would bounce in over a decade and have zero interest in going back to those days.Personally I'm starting to think about looking around for an ops gig again.  From my point-of-view 18F seems more in line with what compromises I'm willing to make.  Obviously USDS (or any other federal gig) will never be exactly like a private sector job, but it would go a long way towards making someone like me polish my rÃ©sumÃ© if USDS were closer to what other federal gigs offer.
                      
                  
      Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. Weâ€™re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and weâ€™re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.Our books sell very well because:- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.If you decide to go with a â€œtraditionalâ€� publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)Iâ€™d specifically like to work with someone on Fullstack Go and Fullstack Rust - which is less about the respective languages and more like guides to building full-stack web applications with each, including third-party libraries, etc. But weâ€™re also looking to write content about Python, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.If this sounds like something youâ€™d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/(I've talked more about our economics of writing books here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17015117)
                      
                  
      This is very cool! Last year I wrote a manuscript on an hands-on approach to learning Python [0][1], going to apply on your site.. :)[0] https://github.com/joaoventura/full-speed-python[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16622038
                      
                  
      This looks cool. Couple of bits of feedback on your website: the â€œRequest for Booksâ€� link appears to be broken on the landing page you linked here. The hamburger menu in the upper right doesnâ€™t do anything for me in iOS Safari. I have an adblocker though so maybe thatâ€™s interfering?I'll fix those, thanks!!Another tiny thing: Under the Request for Books topic you have spelled it Pheonix instead of Phoenix.This sounds like something I'd love to get into, but I don't have any book writing experience. Do you have any tips/pointers for me? Can you recommend any online courses that might help me learn more about technical book writing?We will teach you :)What's most important is that you've used your topic in production and you have some "earned secrets" that don't normally appear in API docs that you'd love to share to others. I always say that we're writing the books we wish existed when we were learning.We have some internal training on how to think about outlining, how to evaluate the audience, and how to refresh yourself on the things beginners want to know. We'll also work with beta readers before we launch, so you'll be able to test the material against a fresh audience.Basically, if we decide to work together, I'll be working with you closely through every step of the process: outlining, drafting, coding, revising, editing, marketing, etc.If this interests you, please apply.
                      
                  
      There are definitely topics I can think of that I have always wished were in the books I learned from. I'll let the ideas churn for a bit before I apply. Thanks so much for the quick response :)Quick note @jashmenn : in the last sentence of section 8 of the "write a book" page, "filling" is misspelled as "filing" (missing n).Also fullstack.io seems pretty cool!

I'm interested in the Backend Manager position and located in D.C.I think right now we're a little more cautious about a remote manager (it'll be our first) than ICs of all seniority levels. Definitely happy to have a conversation about it, though, and I have a soft spot from my time in DC.Ok, I'll add a note in my cover letter regarding this interaction. I'm sure you have thought of this, but I think it is a powerful indicator to remote ICs if their manager is also remote.

      I was really interested in this until I saw the salary. Is this for a jr role? Its very low.Nope, not a junior. For our staff roles, we have Junior - Mid Tier - Senior - Principal. This is for a Mid Tier role.It's just how it is here, sadly - I wish we could change it, and so does my boss.Nobody is here for the money; we get to work on pretty cool projects with quite a big user base (we're talking millions of users and billions of request per day) - No. 6 Alexa rank for the U.K, and one of 2 non-startups in the Top 20. We have a lot of authority and a relatively relaxed work environment

      SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTEThe story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 8 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. Weâ€™ve hired 3 remote developers so far and itâ€™s been a great experience!SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+2 to GMT+8 should be OK.Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.
                      
                  
      Amen! I wish more companies would realize that SPAs are not the right solution in many cases.>remote-friendlyI love that word. Maybe some day I would apply

You will love this job if you: 
1. Thrive in small teams (employee #5!)
2. Want to build and own a big chunk of the code base
3. Hate doing the same thing over and over again
4. Will do whatever it takes to solve the problem (such as using regexes instead of a DNN)Our stack: 
Python (scikit, pytorch, spacy)
Docker
AWSYou ideally have: 
1. CS/STEM Bachelors/Masters
2. 2-4 years experience building NLP products
3. Familiarity with Information Extraction & Sequence labelingNice to haves: 
1. Experience designing data annotation pipelines
2. Interest in linguistics

      Maybe I'm wrong about the intention based on seeing NLP, but wouldn't this be more so replacing paralegals, and serving as complementary to the lawyers? If you are replacing lawyers, what's the value prop in your own words?I love the idea of applying tech to law and seems like it has a lot of promise-- the phrase "replacing $occupation" was surprising though, I must say, as tech companies usually sugarcoat this with "empowering $occupation" or something of that sort.

We want to build intelligent multi-step campaigns that educate and inform prospects as the first introduction to our company, explore new campaign platforms and make smart data-driven decisions about what to pursue.I realize marketing jobs aren't usually what gets posted here, but the people who have really thrived at Varonis are both really technical (a third of the marketing team are full stack devs who moved into marketing, myself included) and adept at marketing.
