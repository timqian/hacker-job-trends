Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why weâ€™re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteranâ€™s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.Itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      Huygens ING | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Software Engineer | Full-time, onsite | $35K â€“ $60Build open source software that slowly but surely gathers all historical data in EuropeWe're a team of engineers at the Royal Academy of Sciences in the Netherlands. 
We build a Backend as a Service that allows users to deposit their data[1]. 
We're looking for front-end / back-end engineers (we prefer people who like a little bit of both) to add features for exposing the data (search, visualisation) and for working with the data (distributes storage, reasoning/inferring knowledge).We provide an environment where people enjoy freedom of work, where our clients understand the uncertainty of experimentation (they're researchers after all) and where all code is published under an open-source license.We're using java (yes, voluntarily), react/redux (I know, sooo 2016) and we're hosting on kubernetes (sorry, no disparaging remark here).
We don't really care if you've used these exact technologies before, but we do care if you have built up greenfield applications as well as to have worked on applications that have been in development for a few years.Interview process: phone interview -> at a later date a technical challenge (in person or screenshare) -> final interview (finalizing the agreement)Drop me a line at jauco.noordzij . huygens.knaw.nl![1] http://github.com/huygensING/timbuctoo
                      
                  
      35-60k... euros? That's kinda low even in pound sterling. Is this what folks get paid in The Netherlands as a "software engineer"?
                      
                  
      Yeah that's euro's.We're bound by the collective bargaining agreement (cao) for universities. So it's a bit low even for dutch standards.However, it's hard to compare it against SV or london positions because the cost of living is lower, and a lot of the conttact is very much in favour of the employee (a company cannot just fire you for example, you get health benefits that are probably very good by us standards).I'm purposefully not making a case here. The vsnu cao is online[1] and you should make your own deliberation.[1]: http://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/CAO/Januari%202016/CAO_N...
                      
                  
      Good luck, hope you find someone. Luckily, most people who see this and scoff won't have been the person you're looking for anyway.

      Similar question to the other person: I applied via your portal a while ago.  Want to talk?
                      
                  
      I've applied through the portal about 5 days back, when can I expect to hear back from you guys? :)
                      
                  
      Hey, a friendly reminder. Iâ€™m parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map onhttps://whoishiring.ioAlso Iâ€™ve started a small campaign to update thread format and make it more parser friendly for whoishiring.io and others (I know that at least few websites that do similar thing). Also you can read more about whoishiring.io in a recent â€œShow HNâ€� (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13500701)Here is the format.  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, company url}
  Google | Software Developer | SF | VISA https://google.com
  DuckDuckGo | Software Developer | Paoli PA | REMOTE, VISA
or  2) {company} | {job title} | {locations}
  Google | Site Reliability Engineer | London, Zurich, Sydney
  Facebook | Web-developer | London, Zurich
Iâ€™m using this regex to test the firstline.  \s*(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s*(?:\|\s*(?P<attrs>.+))?$

You can test it in Python or here https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/3 (for the match look right).As a result off this calling in previous editions of â€œWho is Hiringâ€� many posters actually complied. Which resulted in more accurate map positions, better tagging (REMOTE, VISA, INTERNSHIP, â€¦) and for some I was even able to get LOGOS!. Thanks!
                      
                  
      From looking at postings so far, my guess is it's not natural for the submitters to remember or accurately list the job params as you've laid out.My suggestion would be, if you're not already doing/working on it, to start doing some basic NLP around the specific verbiage used for each param, and then you can organize by match instead of by position in the list. I'm betting you'll see some nice results without much optimization even since each expected param argument is pretty different from one another.Just an idea, best of luck!
                      
                  
      I agree. I'm talking to HN people, they are in loop as well here. There is a chance that they will suggest something or we will adopt the format that I'm posting. Always would be good to have some feedback before too not miss to many things later.As for the NLP, I'm doing it (kind of and I've tested many things including Stanford NER lib and external APIs) Having said that, If your format wont comply, no worries. I will do my best to find the location, tag the job if it's remote or intern. Although to get the rest like company name, positions names the mission is hard here.
                      
                  
      I hear ya. I was able to format my submission properly (I believe), but just noticed that pattern as I scrolled.
                      
                  
      cool, looks good https://whoishiring.io/s/hn13542817
                      
                  
      is this open source? May be I can contribute.
                      
                  
      When multiple {locations} are specified, do they all get mapped?
                      
                  
      I meant something else (locations in terms of types countries, cities) but I think would be possible to have multiple location in format. It will not work that way right now, but I can try and test(and extend) the script work that way
                      
                  
      You need to account for ONSITE. That's specified at the top, but I don't see it anywhere in your spec.
                      
                  
      If it's not remote, where else could it be?
                      
                  
      You are correct, but imagine to avoid people enquiring about if the position can be remote they write NO REMOTE instead of ONSITE.Anyone searching through the comments for "REMOTE" is going to get all those NO REMOTE jobs as well, which is a pain.  Using ONSITE makes it much more clear.
                      
                  
      It's consistent with what people are posting and the directions given. From the very top:> Please lead with the location of the position and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, please include ONSITE.
                      
                  
      There's the possibility of (Remote, No onsite) in addition to (Remote, onsite)
                      
                  
      I'd reduce that to 'REMOTE (?:ONLY)?'.

I find that quite an inventive way to get your defects looked at.

      David | San Francisco, CA | https://www.senddavid.com | FullÂ­time | OnsiteDavid is a San Francisco-Â­based software startup that combines technology and legal research to help customers resolve disputes with their cable, internet, or wireless service provider. The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.
The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.We currently have a MVP (https://www.senddavid.com) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80Â­-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-Â­4.0% | https://angel.co/david-174/jobs/72943-engineerContact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com

      ROKT | www.rokt.com | Sydney, Australia | ONSITESoftware Engineers (Clojure/ClojureScript)ROKT is hiring thoughtful, talented functional programmers, at all levels, to expand our Clojure team in Sydney.ROKT is a successful startup (~100 employees) with a transaction marketing platform used by some of the world's largest ecommerce sites. Our Sydney-based engineering team supports a business that is growing rapidly around the world. Our Clojure team is responsible for a variety of sites and services written in Clojure and ClojureScript.If you have professional Clojure experience, great. What we're really looking for, though, is developers comfortable with a simple, functional style of writing code -- we'll happily bring you up to speed on Clojure if you're not there already.Due to Australian visa requirements, unfortunately we're only able to consider candidates who already have the legal right to work in Australia, please.Contact Claudio at claudio@rokt.com
                      
                  
      Are the Australian visa requirements that bad? With the current nastiness of trump, isn't this a great opportunity for Australia to steal some talent.Also didn't Trump tell Turnbull that he is an idiot for asking him to take 2000 refugees when he just signed the anti-muslim order?
                      
                  
      Sponsoring engineers to come to Australia is definitely possible -- and in fact we've done it in the past for certain roles.  But, as in some other countries, it does come with the caveat that you need to be able to justify the sponsorship with evidence that it's not possible to find anyone who could do the role and who already has the right to work in Australia.We're pretty open about what sort of candidates we'd consider:  we're looking for good engineers to join the team, and are willing to accept that that means that we might have to spend some time and effort training them up in the technologies we use, etc.  I think that's a great attitude for us to have.  But it does make it pretty difficult for us to turn around and tell the government "we have to bring this specific individual from overseas because no Australian has the exact skillset we need for this role".
                      
                  
      Australia has an H1-B equivalent called a 457 Visa with similar requirements.
                      
                  
      I'm a contractor at ROKT on the Clojure team, it's been a blast working with Sam and the rest of the folks at ROKT.

      Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsiteRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and itâ€™s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and weâ€™re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out one of our product releases here: https://clever.com/products/badges

As a ground-up rewrite, there's lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we'd love to hear from you."Agent Engineer" sounds like something from Person Of Interest, but actually you'll own our lean, mean data collection agent. An ops visibility tool is only as good as the data it collects, and we pride ourselves on gathering everything from logs to system metrics to application metrics to API data. If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything. You'll get to play with packages from Apache to Zookeeper, APIs from AWS to, er, Azure, while tackling challenges such as monitoring 100,000+ simultaneous log files using minimal CPU.If this sounds like fun, check out the links below, or drop us a line at jobs@scalyr.com!https://www.scalyr.com/company/jobs/front-end-engineerhttps://www.scalyr.com/company/jobs/agent-engineer

By facilitating two-way conversations, Hustleâ€™s clients maintain genuine, personal dialogues with hundreds, thousands, and even millions of people. Our clients include Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign, and Our Revolution (Bernie Sanders' organization). It's 48 times more effective than making phone calls.As a product engineer, you will be working on Hustle's core web and mobile products: our web and mobile text messaging apps, our campaign administrative interface, and our message delivery back end. Product engineering at Hustle is unique in that we do not have mobile, front-end and backend specialists. Instead engineers are empowered to develop and ship features in their entirety covering the whole stack.
This feature of product development is enabled by Hustle's particular technology choices: the use of JavaScript, React, React Native and Node.js through out the stack. It's a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very dynamic working environment: form a temporary team for a larger project where you decide to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project form another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.Hustle was started by engineers from Facebook and MongoDB and is backed by top VC firms including Social Capital and Index Ventures.

      Well, I have an answer: <EMPTY STRING>The question itself is risky, even to ask. We cannot condone or encourage anyone breaking contractual agreements - no matter what they might be or how the parties involved feel about them.
                      
                  
      Oh well, my friend says "Thanks for trying". But why is risky to ask?

      Wellframe | Healthcare | Boston, Ma | Onsite/Fulltime https://www.wellframe.comAt Wellframe, we are building an intelligent care-management platform that allows health plans and care-delivery organizations to better manage large populations of complex patients. Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patientsâ€™ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider. We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.We're currently looking for several mid/senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, backend, infra/platform, sre) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you're in the area I'd love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you're actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.Our stack is native Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C), our API is served in a Ruby on Rails monolith and Scala services, on top of MySQL, Cassandra, ElasticSearch and Spark. Our frontend is mostly Backbone + React, although some more complex state we are moving to Redux.Jobs: https://www.wellframe.com/jobs Also feel free to reach out to me at nam@wellframe.com!

      You might be able to get a work permit through the NAFTA/TN1 process, which is supposed to be pretty painless for you and for the company.
                      
                  
      Unfortunately we cannot. We can only extend an offer to candidates that are eligible to work in Canada.
                      
                  
      Interesting. Did IBM laid off HR staff? Even small shops are able to sponsor work permits/visas for Canada...
