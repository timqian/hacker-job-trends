      San Francisco, CAHelp build the most popular mobile apps for the cruise vacation industry. Before you dismiss this as fluff with no technical challenges check out what we're working on. We are associating tens of thousands of Facebook ids with booked cruises across all cruise lines. Besides the obvious chat features (which will be available with the next updates) we want to let cruisers know who in their social graph will be on board with them or landing at their next port from another ship and so on. We are working with the largest port promotions provider to get our users relevant discounts at their next duty-free locations.

      Palo Alto, CA or REMOTE (full-time preferred)Looking for intermediate to advanced full-stack coders and a designer with additional skills.We're just days from launching a restricted beta of our unique idea in the groups and events space, and are planning on launching our real-time product on the web, mobile web, and native mobile to a wide audience in a month or two. Our dev team is all remote right now, but it'd be great if you were local to the peninsula or willing to relocate at some point in the coming months.We've built a real-time stack of our own that bridges backbone.js <-> socket.io <-> gunicorn+gevent (through nginx) <-> django. As the stack matures, we may release the source. The web application is nearly all single-page architecture. We use coffeescript pretty much everywhere, including our javascript tests.* backend: postgres, redis, python, django, gevent + gunicorn* frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, compassI'm looking for:1. Advanced web jacks-of-many-trades. You know a lot about several things from above and have at least tried your hand at a demo app using the rest. Backend/frontend/deployment. We'll be growing our user base very soon and will need some deployment automation skills (chef or puppet + fabric) and knowledge/experience scaling the above technologies. Note: we have a great lead architect right now, but are on the lookout for locals (or those who can move to the bay) who want senior developer ownership and can be mentors/leaders as we move towards having more of a local presence.2. Talented web app designers (referrals would also be good). Even with the nifty tech we're building, our app will probably live/die based on making an intuitive UI with fun and easy experience. There are several unique challenges in this product that require novel widgets -- creativity is a must. Would be great if you have more than just design skills, but very high quality design is more important than ability to build it.gmail - davidmarble

If you want to come help us build the future of location products, let us know through our jobs page:https://foursquare.com/jobs/If you have any questions, feel free to email me: jorge@foursquare.com
                      
                  
      What do your data analysts/scientists do on a normal basis? I just sent in my applications to both because it sounds like the technical experimenting I loved doing during my graduate school.
                      
                  
      Excellent question! I work on the data team here, and we work on a variety of projects. Some of our features rely on data from our applications, and so we help develop those features by building our data models. On the other hand, some other projects, like our recent infographic[1], are open-ended - you have the freedom to come up with your own hypotheses and test them against our data.If you have a good background in data munging and analysis, it's incredibly fun work - a nice mix between the creativity of investigating problems that interest you and the rigor of data science.[1] http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/06/20/holysmokes10millionpeo...
                      
                  
      To add to what chimeracoder said above: a lot of our products are data driven. The prime example is Explore, our recommendation engine. It recommends places that you might want to go to, based on your past checkin history, your friends' checkin histories, the checkin history of the venues you've been to or might go to, the time of day, etc. Other examples of data-driven products include our venue search, friend recommendations, etc.In addition to working on our data-driven products, the data team also analyzes and visualizes the critical business metrics that keep the company and the executive team informed about the state of the of the business and help us make data-informed decisions about our products and our business priorities.In terms of the day-to-day, this might involve writing Hadoop jobs (or more likely Hive queries), wrangling data in Ruby or Python, working with business or product leads to understand how things are performing, and coming up with new things to pay attention to in our data and more insightful ways to look at it.

      You mostly develop software on top of Java?
                      
                  
      Not sure what you mean. Java is one of the main languages we use, along with Scala, Groovy, and JavaScript.
                      
                  
      Yes, i meant to ask with that technologies you work with, there was few information on your website, although the opensource projects you contribute were a good indication of it
                      
                  
      OK, hope my list helped. We are technology-neutral, and regularly hire (for example) C# or Python developers and teach them Java, so don't let unfamiliarity with any particular language stop you considering us.
                      
                  
      Yeah it sounds interesting, particularly for developers who like to diversify.Although the large percent of my career has been developing content management and "corporate" applications in PHP, wether i had to or not, now i mostly been focusing on Python/Django because i like the language, the tooling and feel productive in it, on the things i have to do.But always loved Java, even when i was learning PHP 11 years ago, i spent a lot of time around Struts (1.x), Hibernate and Ibatis, that's where i got the MVC/ORM/Framework skills from, which was useful for "easily" picking/understanding a lot of other stuff in other languages. Also when Groovy got some traction, i spent personal time fiddling with it, was cool, which also lead to spending some time around Grails. But i never got deep in pure Java skills, even though i have a 700 page "bible" around the house somewhere.Also tried out Jboss Seam, which found out to be kind of awesome for somethings and at a time was contracted for 4 months, to extend features on an existing project built on it, although grasping the whole JSF/J2EE life-cycle can be a pain and still ended the project missing a lot of know-how about it all. For another particular short-time job, i developed some EJB "if it's not working, there's not enough XML in it" 2.1 code.Not being a rocket engineer (not even an engineer) and a perfectionist trying to meet deadlines, i ended up loving Python and Django, good ORM, good tooling, community and the backend admin feature is a killer one for me.

Disruptive B2B start-up is looking for Technical Co-FounderI developed a concept of a web-based platform that puts the 21st century into market research by utilising smartphone applications and their developer communities.Since pitching to industry experts I have received great interest and been asked to apply to an incubator who would like to support me and a small team to develop the concept further.-----------------------------------------------------I'm looking for a hands-on technical co-founder who can help me turn my mock-ups into an MVP over the next three months and then on to launch and beyond. Suitable frameworks exist in open-source format, which can be built upon (up to you).If you are a self-motivated developer who likes the idea of disrupting a large market then please get in contact for more information! Experience and track record of bringing a customer focused product to market and start-up experience is a huge bonus.----------------------------------------------------With my science background (PhD), I'm somewhat technical but I won't be an idiot and list the different technologies I think you will need. This is of course up to you and you alone will decide on the stack and direction that it takes.As your partner I will be charge of product design, business development, sales and marketing. I am driven by my vision, I work extremely hard and I will do whatever it takes to take us to the next level. I also see our partnership as a great opportunity to learn more programming and to eventually contribute some code myself.I can offer co-founder equity as well as a negotiable salary (based on us getting into the incubator). I am not expecting you to rush into this partnership head-on. If you are also doing some freelance work on the side (etc.), I am flexible enough to work around that until we have pocketed the incubator funding.If you are a cool dude and you want to know more then contact me at dapgutmann@gmail.com

      Los Angeles or Bay Area or Shanghai preferred, but remote work is a definite possibility. Full-time only. If you're interested in remote work, you must live in the U.S. (U.S. citizen living outside of the U.S. might be okay)Factual aims to be the place where people meet to share, improve, and mash-up data. Our vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider for startups and developers, so that they can focus on innovation instead of data acquisition.We have a terrific team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense).

We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.Ideally you know Java, Clojure, and/or Ruby, and you'll get bonus points for experience with machine learning, NoSQL, algorithms, infrastructure, and/or Hadoop.http://www.factual.com/jobsYou can also email me personally at leo -at- factual.com
                      
                  
      Just double-checked with our hiring manager, and I was wrong.... U.S. citizens living in other countries who want to work remotely would not be okay due to different laws, tax complexities, etc.
                      
                  
      That's a shame. The tax and other advantages for both parties are significant. In your position it's something I would familiarize myself with.

      Yes, we provide visa sponsorship.
                      
                  
      [this is my interpretation and not necessarily the company's official stance]Nothing wrong with citizens. We are not expressing a preference for non-citizens, but we are not avoiding them either.

      Chapel Hill / Research Triangle Park, NCFogbeam LabsSeeking technical and/or non-technical co-founder(s).At Fogbeam Labs, we like to think of ourselves as "The Next Great Open Source Software Company."  We're building awesome information retrieval and knowledge management systems (all open-source, ALv2) using Groovy, Grails, Scala, Java, and many existing open-source tools and libraries:  Lucene, Solr, Mahout, UIMA, OpenNLP, Jena, Droids, Roller, Camel, etc.If you have a passion for open-source software, and are particularly interested in information retrieval, machine-learning, AI, and want to be part of a company that's pursuing a proven business model (selling software to other businesses, for, like, actual money), and want to get in early and become an actual co-founder (with a corresponding equity stake), ping me.NOTE:  Not funded yet, and the current founder (mindcrime) is still working a day job, so another co-founder would not be expected to commit any more than I am... So, basically, 20-30 hours a week (including weekends) until we reach a point where we can pay salaries.  Yeah, we're talking about being a founder here, not an employee.2nd NOTE:  This is not just a pipe-dream or a hobby project, despite the day-job thing. I've just had an excellent customer discovery interview with a very large and well-known bank headquartered here in NC, and they were very responsive to what we're working on.  This and the Customer Discovery we've been doing the past few months strongly suggests that there is real demand for the kind of stuff we'll be doing; and Red Hat (if not others) have proven the open source model.  See, for reference:http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-23/red-hat-sales-to-tr...fogbeam (at) gmail (dot) com

      Unrelated, but I visited Luxembourg last year while backpacking in Europe. After fearfully walking a few blocks away from the train station full of very pushy homeless people I found sprawling bridges overlooking storybook castles and lush gardens! Beautiful country!It might be hard to find non-remote devs with the exact knowledge you require as the population of Luxembourg is relatively small, no?
                      
                  
      Nice to hear that you liked it here. Many people call Luxembourg the small switzerland. 
They also have plans to reorganize the main central station and to build a park on it. So in 5-10 years, it will look much nicer.We don't require our applicants to be experts in these fields, but smart people willling to create things and to learn. We found quite a few good people during the last few months.The plug and play center (from San Francisco) will also be opening its European offices here in the future, so there might be more competition for developers in the future, who knows.

Iâ€™ve worked in AWS for the past year and Iâ€™ve learned more in that time than I thought possible. Iâ€™m an infrastructure person at heart, and at other companies Iâ€™ve worked for, Iâ€™m always torn between doing the deep engineering that I love, or working on a more customer focused product. In AWS, they are one and the same. I like having scalability, availability, and performance as core features of the product Iâ€™m building. Another thing I love about working in AWS is the impact your work has - your service is used by thousands of developers, and those developers use your service in ways you never imagined, which are then used by millions of people.Detailed job descriptions :https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/133388/jobhttps://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137679/jobhttps://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137677/job
