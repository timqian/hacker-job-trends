Weft - http://weft.io - Cambridge/Boston, MA (office is in central sq.)   ===========================
   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================

We're the single source of truth in logistics data -- we track every boat on the water, every plane in the sky, and every truck on the ground so that we can know everything that's going on in the logistics world. We do a lot of analysis and optimization, too.Weâ€™re working in the largest, least sexy, most invisible industry in the world â€” 90% of everything has been on a ship at one point in time.The problem -> To try to decrease costs, carries have been increasing the size of container ships. The only problem there is that as container ships get larger, the variability in the global supply chain goes up (e.g. a large ship being late causes a headache to more people than a small one).How we fix it -> We track every ship on the water and run a bunch of analysis on our data sets so that we can help our customers smooth out the rough edges. (One company we're working with spends 6.5 mil every month on â€œlate feesâ€� because of these rough edges).   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================

Web/data stack -> clojure + postgres/cassandra/redis/rabbit + ruby on rails + hadoop/EMR (weâ€™re a SOA shop)Mobile -> iOS, android in the near termAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from CPG companies and telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors (a16z, atlas)!Looking for help on frontend and data science sides! (also looking for experimentalists for fun hedge fund stuff)If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!
                      
                  
      Mozilla Research - Video Codec Engineer - Remote or one of the global officesThe Internet needs a royalty free video codec appropriate for universal deployment with no gatekeepers. Creating a better video codec is a difficult task, and creating one with unencumbered technology is even harder. We've achieved that goal for audio with Opus, but video is still dominated by royalty bearing codecs like H.264.We're looking for a Senior Research Engineer to join us building Daala, a next-next generation video codec being developed by Mozilla Research in conjunction with the Xiph.Org Foundation. Daala uses lapped transforms, overlapped-block motion compensation, frequency-domain prediction, gain-shape (perceptual) vector quantization, , and non-binary arithmetic coding to achieve superior performance.If you like low level code, numeric programming, signal processing, algorithms, or machine learning, you'd probably enjoy working on Daala.More details and to apply:

      Heap (YC W13) - Software Engineer - San Francisco or Remotehttps://heapanalytics.com/jobs=== What's Heap? ===Heap is taking a new approach to web and iOS analytics: just capture everything. Whereas other analytics tools require you to define events upfront, Heap lets you run instant, retroactive analytics without writing code.=== The Role ===Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack. We're eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day.Weâ€™d like to get to know you if:* You enjoy teaching yourself whatever is necessary to build something.* You plow through obstacles.* Youâ€™ve written 10,000 lines of code that look really embarrassing in retrospect.* Youâ€™ve written 10,000 lines of good code since then.* You communicate ideas with clarity and precision.* You make decisions with a preference for empiricism and measurement.* You like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes.Our stack is Node + Redis + Postgres + Backbone + D3. Some things we're working on:* Data capture. Weâ€™re integrating with more clients and frameworks, including Android, AngularJS, and Backbone.js, all with virtually no performance overhead or integration cost.* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice the data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data.* Data visualization. Simple pre-generated graphs just don't cut it. There's an enormous number of ways to organize the data. Existing tools only scratch the surface.Heap was in Y Combinatorâ€™s W13 batch. Soon after, we raised a $2M seed round from Ron Conway, Ram Shriram, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, and others.We work in SF but are absolutely open to remote engineers.

They are growing fast and are now in need of a skilled full stack software engineer to take this MVP to the next level.  The current platform is a mixture of open software (linux, influxdb) and Java.

The right person will not only have a huge impact on the choice of languages and direction of the platform but potentially the electric car industry.

The company is well-funded by some of the best enterprise angels and VCs in the business (https://angel.co/bettercompany).Our app facilitates anonymous sharing within companies.

      Connexity - Camarillo/Los Angeles, CAWe're building a sophisticated advertising platform to help brands and retailers sell efficiently through loads of shopping intent data.1) We need a Rails dev to own our campaign management interface.  While we have a growing set of systems doing automated optimization and altering, you'll help humans effectively manage hundreds of campaigns for well-known brands and retailers.  We serve 50+ million ads every day and process 3.5 billion transactions, and you'll be right in the thick of it.  You'll work directly with Postgres, Redis, HBase and Hadoop.  You'll also likely play a key role in developing a new API for several key partners.2) We need someone with fierce tenacity to run QA and technical ad operations.  When an account manager sees that we recorded no clicks for a certain campaign in Firefox browsers, you'll get to hunt down the resolution.  You'd bring a meticulous eye for detail to bear with browser and Javascript chops.  Done well, you'll be a daily hero.  (As it turns out, the folks writing "system code" perform best when they can stay in the zone, head down as much as possible.)  Count on becoming well acquainted with Hive.3) Finally, we're looking for a strong DevOps team member.  You know networking and Linux very well.  You'll help improve our Hadoop clusters.  You'll tune monitoring and alerting thresholds.  Most importantly, you'll eagerly seek to expand your usefulness as you work with the rest of the dev team.  We're not driven by dogma, and you'll find yourself in good company if your sole priority is fixing the problem at hand.I'm one of the lead devs, and you can reach me at dlarsen@connexity.com.  I'm happy to speak informally about our situation, and can hook you up with the HR folk at the appropriate time.

      PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES (http://PSYT.co.uk) â€” London, UK* We're looking for an experienced Android and/or full stack engineerWHAT WE DO. Weâ€™re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nationâ€™s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (http://mappiness.org.uk). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (http://www.getsomeheadspace.com).WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate (weâ€™ve tried RubyMotion â€” impressive, but probably not for us â€” and weâ€™re playing with Swift). Our Android apps donâ€™t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.WHO YOU MIGHT BE. Weâ€™re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important â€” and usually the hardest â€” thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.WHERE WEâ€™RE AT. We've just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so youâ€™d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk

      ListRunner (YC S2014), San Francisco And/Or Montreal - FULL-TIME (Can help with VISA)ListRunner (www.listrunnerapp.com) brings project management to doctors in hospitals. It's hard to believe but doctors are still using paper and pager to manage their team and critical patient information. They're not even allowed to use email..We're getting amazing traction - and excitement from doctors - and we are looking to expand the team with a few key people:1) Backend developer: We use Mongo and Node. Lots of very cool challenge in building a robust and flexible API. Experience with real-time synchronization, AWS, security, offline apps and Angular.js is definitely a plus.2) Product/UX designer: Building an app for doctors is a big UX challenge. They're extremely busy people and are used to have access to lots of information all the time.3) UI Designer: Doctors are tired of those ugly 1980 computer systems still in use in hospitals. They want to work with the same kind of polished and beautiful apps that they've started using at home. We're looking to push the current healthcare design status quo to a new level.4) ios and Android developers: We're looking for great ios/android developers with an eye for design who can take a leading role in implementing beautiful and snappy native apps.5) Machine Learning / Data geek: Right now, 75% of critical patient information is trashed at the end of the day. That information is not going back in the EMR and is totally wasted. There are so many opportunities in helping finding better diagnosis, helping doctors be more efficient, helping the departments/hospitals save time and money, etc.6) Front-end developer: We're looking for a great front-end developer/designer who love writing clean html/css code with an attention to details (We care about those pixels). Experience with Angular.js with an eye for design is definitely a plus.----We're a multi-disciplinary team (Two doctors on the team) solving a massive healthcare challenge. Doctors love ListRunner and they can't wait to start using it every day. If you're looking for an opportunity to use your technical and design skill to solve a real, practical and meaningful problem, please reach out to us (contact@listrunnerapp.com or to me directly at phzbox@gmail).
                      
                  
      Ideally you'll have a full immunization record so we can take you into hospitals to work directly with the doctors. We are also live in a number of hospitals in Southern Africa and our ideal candidate would be able to travel there for a few weeks to work with our doctors there.

      REMOTE Senior Ruby Developer Needed!Hi. We're looking for an awesome Senior Ruby Developer to join our growing team. If you've ever wanted to work for a interesting security startup with great people this is your chance. We're a little different than your average startup so we put together this FAQ.Q: Ok who are you guys?
A: ThreatSim is comprised of some really smart security hackers who were tired of working for large companies. There are people here from Mitre, HP, Fortify, RSA, Verizon Business, Cybertrust, and others. We wanted to do the small company thing and it's worked well for us.Q: What would I be working on?
A: You'd be working on our SaaS service, ThreatSim. It lets our customers send simulated phishing campaigns against themselves. When the user clicks on the simulated phishing link they are immediately shown training. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data).Essentially we get to think like bad guys and help our customers improve their security. It's an interesting space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place. We simulate evil AND give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization. You will spend a lot of time thinking "if I was a bad guy I'd..." then have to pivot and think "if I was a security engineer I'd...".Q: Where is this position located?
A: This is a remote position that is open to US residents only located within the US. We understand that not every developer wants to move to SF, NYC, or DC so we let you work wherever you are productive.Q: What technology to you use?
A: ThreatSim is built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq, redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing in a startup.Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?
A: Here's a bullet list:Ruby on Rails 3.0+
Relational and non-relational databases: MySQL, Redis
Background job processors (e.g. Sidekiq)
Javascript frameworks (e.g. jQuery, pure JS)
Client-side and server side MVC
Comfortable with git for version control
Continuous integration
MS Office (hah right, could you imagine?)If you are interested, send along a resume to jobs@threatsim.com

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software. We're hiring for full time positions as software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - We aren't limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I've worked with Objective-C (and Swift),
    Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, get in touch with me:ej@mutuallyhuman.com
