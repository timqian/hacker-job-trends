      I applied to Khan and they told me they have no slots to fill anymore (but thanks for trying...and feel free to contribute in your spare time). I can program in jQuery and know Django -- I sent them several demos directly related to generating math exercises. Either they are getting many applications from talented devs (and I didnt make the cut) or they arnt really hiring. I just hope they arnt using the prospect of a job as part of some viral marketing scheme.
                      
                  
      I can assure you we don't consider turning down applicants as marketing.Please feel free to apply again in a few months - we try to err on the side of caution when hiring, and any interviewing process likely has a large margin of error.
                      
                  
      Seriously, why do you advertise positions if you're not going to hire until "in a few months"? The impression that you're making on applicants is that you're just fishing for resumes. Please consider that applicants put time and effort into preparing a cover letter and their resume. If that's how you treat applicants, I wonder how you treat employees?Sadly, you're not the only one in the industry who behaves like this. I experienced exactly the same thing with Mozilla this year. I welcome that hokua is making this public because that way of treating applicants should really be outlawed.
                      
                  
      Why so cautious? Are you not hiring programmers at-will? If Im not performing on par with a team, Id leave no hard feelings. The reason I applied is im highly interested in building tools for educators, and currently run a business that sells such tools.
                      
                  
      Training is expensive and time consuming for the team as a whole. "Trying someone out" is usually not efficient.
                      
                  
      You can try someone out before you invest in them. Its called internships/probationary period. Lots of companies do it.
                      
                  
      To "try them out" you have to teach them enough about your process and code base to be useful. That still can take significant amounts of time. The primary investment isn't money, it's time.

      San Francisco, CA (SOMA)Twitter is hiring: https://twitter.com/jobsTwitter (https://twitter.com) is a real-time information network with the mission of connecting people everywhere to the latest information that is interesting and relevant to them. We're hiring across the organization, for a broad range of technical and non-technical positions. Come help us solve some hard problems!
                      
                  
      Dammit Greg! Sure, me posting this months ago helped you get a job at Twitter, but that doesn't mean you get to post it in the future. :).P.S. Come work at Twitter, it's awesome.
                      
                  
      Are you hiring front-end engineers?
                      
                  
      Note: This company usually does not respond to applicants.I applied for a few positions over the year and never heard back.
                      
                  
      I applied to Twitter and the HR person asked me for dates for phone interviews, and then didn't respond for weeks after I gave them the dates.  Twitter HR and their recruitment process is amongst the worst I've ever encountered.Also, if you get rejected by them, they don't have the common courtesy to let you know, even if you try contacting them.  Apparently it's beneath them to respond with even 140 characters.
                      
                  
      I went through several rounds of interviews that seemed to go well, and was asked "when i coukd start" - i had to follow up with the internal recruiter several times before I got the "we've decided to take this position in a different direction" rejection.I found something far better though, thankfully. My impression from the interview process was internal chaos, among other things.
                      
                  
      I applied for an internship and got two interviews, but they seemed pretty disorganized.  They often called at different times from what they said they would (usually when I was in class).  They also had to reschedule the interviews several times.  The initial informational phone call I also got twice which was strange (about half way through the second one I mentioned she had called the day before with the same information).  Seems like a fun place to work though and the interviewers were great.
                      
                  
      Yes. https://twitter.com/job.html?jvi=owPbVfwb,Job

      I really wish we could figure out a way to stop posting these on Saturday, which guarantees the hiring thread won't be on the front page on a weekday.
                      
                  
      On the other hand, job-seekers who have been here for longer than a few months probably remember the hiring threads always happen on the 1st.I think that's easier to remember than "1st of the month, unless that falls on a weekend, then it's the 1st business day following the 1st of the month"; which tends to get further conflated to include holidays.
                      
                  
      Hehe. And also, if you look at the account posting these threads, "whoishiring", you'll see that it says:> This account automatically submits a 'Who is Hiring? (Month YYYY Edition)' post at 8 AM Eastern time on the 1st of every month.http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring(Just happened to find this out myself because I thought, "who is this person that is so regular with these posts?")
                      
                  
      I agree, much easier. I also always include the hiring threads in my weekly Hacker Newsletter (http://www.hackernewsletter.com) in case someone does miss it when it comes out.
                      
                  
      Couldn't pg add a way to pin these posts on the front page for a week or add a link on the top bar ?
                      
                  
      Parent's idea plus this would be nice. At least make it a pinned thread through the first day of the week.
                      
                  
      It would make a lot more sense if the monthly job post was listed on the 'Jobs' page alongside the handful of YC companies listed.
                      
                  
      Wait until next month. :-)
                      
                  
      I could be wrong, but I think Saturday is a great day for these threads. The work week is mainly relevant to people in 9-to-5 jobs. If I were looking for a job (I'm not) I would generally avoid doing the search during the week. Why? At least on Wall Street, people get fired if their bosses figure out that they're looking for jobs. Once you start searching, you've effectively quit as they see it.That said, I'm coming to the conclusion that one should always be looking for jobs at least in a limited sense (networking, skill building). It's not disloyal. It's just smart. Jobs end, sometimes suddenly and involuntarily. It's a fact of life and people need to be prepared.
                      
                  
      The work week is mainly relevant to people in 9-to-5 jobsYou mean like a hiring manager | HR person | future coworker who might post here?  I could see arguments going either way about weekend posting.  At least it should be at the top of the ask HN list for a while since it is a bit lower churn for people not wanting it to disappear because of the weekend post. etc.
                      
                  
      Well... I really think that's a reason why having this on a weekend is good; I don't want to hear from a hiring manager or HR person.  Those are the people that are already flooding my LinkedIn account with offers for soul-crushing positions.  By contrast, the people that see these things on the weekend are people that are here because they're interested, in their spare time, to read about programming, because they actually like it.  Those are the people I want as prospective employers.
                      
                  
      That boss can only fire you so quickly once you start looking because he's already been looking. And he likes not only having that freedom, but that you do not.They don't know what loyal means. Don't kill yourself trying to show them.
                      
                  
      Rockefeller Center NYC, onsite: #1 looking for #2Bootstrapped prop ultra low latency trading firm (as opposed to a firm which originally had investors and later kicked them out), and I'm willing to cut significant equity. see http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2835656 for some discussion of what I do.I'm not a traditional finance guy, and I'm definitely not looking for a banking drone. Most of those tasks are handled by cron anyway. Sanctity of weekends are preserved.The ideal candidate: mastery, to the level of obsession, with C/Python/coreutils; insatiable curiosity; inquisitive to a fault; chutzpah to challenge every assumption and assertion; calm under pressure; and desire to be involved in every aspect of the business.Windonauts need not apply (I currently use 2 27" iMacs in the office)Excited? intransigence123@gmail.com
                      
                  
      This looks like a quite a example of arrogance.Remember the more egoistic you are , more you double your chances of failure. Just a advice , take on its face value.
                      
                  
      I tried working with financial recruiters at the very beginning and realized that the type of candidates they present are really interested in a cushy job with a strong salary and significant returns on the upside and no downside risk, which puts my risk control desires at odds with their profit desires.If I come off as arrogant I sincerely apologize. As a person, I am not particularly arrogant. With regards to some points, like about using cron to do tasks, there are good reasons for bringing that up: I have worked with a broker who literally opened and copied text files using notepad to send off compliance reports (which i had originally sent to them via FTPS).  When I pointed out to the employee that a cron job or task scheduler item could automate the process, the answer was along the lines of "then I wouldn't have a job".  And i would classify that type of role as a drone role.
                      
                  
      This is the second story about a "drone" that I've heard in 3 days.  I'm surprised that people like this slip by and linger without providing much value . . .
                      
                  
      There was a time, as late as 5 to 10 years ago, where people were needed in the process.  Nowadays, the same motions are being repeated because those people don't want to lose their jobs.  And they are sufficiently low cost (250K is paltry for a 100M business) that the institutions themselves aren't really incentivized to streamline.
                      
                  
      I honestly don't see what aspect of that post is arrogant? Could you elaborate, because if there is something in there and I don't see it, I don't want to make the same mistake (I'm not be sarcastic!)

      Oakland, CA - Root LabsWe are a fully-funded startup with a major paying customer, building a web-based service for analyzing and searching code. You will be in charge of building a large, distributed computing system for parsing and indexing code for our search engine. We've been creating the code analysis tools for existing customers, and we need you to build the automation framework to help us scale. We are building something really uncommon for a HN hiring thread, so contact me even if you're just curious!We're solving problems that will have a major impact on the software industry. For example, one goal is that independent, open-source authors have a way to get paid for their work.You'll team up with us to implement solutions to some challenging problems. (But don't worry, you don't already need to be an expert at all of these).    * Nearest-neighbor search in high dimension (or knowing how to
      avoid this by projecting to a lower dimension)
    * Classifying code by various metrics (structural flowgraph analysis,
      symbol sequences and frequency, etc.)
    * Map/reduce deconstruction of complex queries
    * Distributed computing design, cluster management, software deployment,
      load balancing 

Being a good programmer is the most important part. We mostly work in Python and C/C++ although considering Scala or other options for some tasks. We use PostgreSQL, Redis, and Riak for a lot of the existing components.You need to understand distributed computing, fault detection and error recovery, messaging, etc. An interest (but not expertise) in low-level details like compilers, operating systems, and reverse-engineering is a good plus.We have much more details here:http://www.rootlabs.com/developer-job.htmlAsk any questions in the comments, or contact me directly at the address in my profile. Thanks!

      Really REMOTE. You don't even have to be in the USA.deviantART (http://www.deviantart.com) wants developers. We're fully remote[1]; there's no central office with a devteam located there. We expect all hires to be comfortable working in PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL; we like our developers to be able to hack on any part of the site, rather than being frontend/backend specialists.One exception to all that: there's an Infrastructure Engineer position which is located in Vancouver. It's C++/Java focused, and involves developing backend services used by the rest of the site.We post information about our development process here sometimes: http://dt.deviantart.com/blog/ Apply here: http://deviantart.theresumator.com/apply?source=hn[1]: http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/We-re-all-remote-220038037
                      
                  
      I've applied for this multiple times, and as I see here you haven't replied to a lot of people. I've met one of your developers at a DeviantArt meeting, and he seemed like one of the nicest blokes I've ever met.Extreme shame about the management.
                      
                  
      This reminds me of something the CEO of a fortune 500 company I worked for said during a company-wide Q&A. An employee had mentioned that he applied for an opportunity within the company and never heard back from the hiring manager. The CEO didn't miss a beat, responding: "Let me just say to all the managers in the room, if I ever hear of that happening, you won't be managing in this organization."
                      
                  
      I had the same experience with a company in Gibraltar, got to the phone interview, went well, was told to expect an email with details of flights over and heard nothing, it's been months now. The CEO didn't come to my rescue, and I haven't heard from them since.
                      
                  
      I applied to this too in the past, and got to the point where they said they wanted a second interview, but then they said that they 'moved forward with another candidate.' The position is still open so apparently that candidate went no where too.I will note that at times during the interview process they would say that I would hear from them 'shortly' but then hear nothing for upwards of 3 weeks.
                      
                  
      Note: I've applied to this opportunity before.  Did not receive a response.  Funny to see it posted again...Maybe they are looking for something different than "PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL"?  Hard to say...
                      
                  
      Yeah, I've applied there to without any sort of response. My impression was that they either are looking for something more specific than they let on here, or that they have a high turn over rate. Not necessarily bad things, but they might narrow down their employee search by providing more details
                      
                  
      Yeah but you should still at least respond to people. I mean, why not? It's a win-win. Candidates at least find out and you look good by showing you care enough to get back to them.
                      
                  
      It's called having some common courtesy.  Companies such as yours that think it's beneath them to spend the 10 seconds to respond back to people is a huge redflag that they're filled with arrogant pricks.
                      
                  
      Unfortunately this courtesy is anything but common in my experience, it's not the exception. Hell, I've had companies and recruiters disappear after showing initial interest, e.g. after the phone screening stage. Call me a cynic but these days I'm pleasantly surprised when I receive even a negative reply.
                      
                  
      I would love for someone to put together a weekend project where people can anonymously list where they apply and if they ever got a response.
                      
                  
      Welcome to the club. Mostly. I applied for that as well. At least I got a (negative) response but I think it was automated. I'm not sure what they're actually looking for, maybe we're not "artsy" enough or something...
                      
                  
      I would encourage anyone wanting to apply here to read this first: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3061860

For people who have just published a paper, we want that paper instantly to get into the hands of people who are interested in it. It often takes 12-24 months for a paper to get through the journal publication cycle, and to get distributed to the relevant research community. We believe that this is a large inefficiency in the research process, and we believe that there is an opportunity to make a huge impact here. We want to bring the time it takes for a paper to be distributed around a given research community down from 12-24 months down to a matter of hours.Right now we have over 600,000 academics signed up, with about 2,000 joining each day. Our monthly uniques are over 2 million. We have about 700,000 papers, with about 80,000 new papers being added per month.Amongst other technologies, we work with Rails, Redis, MongoDB, Beanstalkd, Varnish, Solr, PostgreSQL, Node.js and Memcached.We're a small team of 7 people in San Francisco, backed by venture capital (Spark Ventures) and angel investors (Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu, and Rupert Pennant-Rea, Chairman of the Economist, amongst others). We have a very engineering-focused culture. You can read more about our culture here http://academia.edu/hiring/culture and here http://academia.edu/hiring.We have a very collaborative culture, where everyone discusses everything going on with the company: engineering, product, revenue, user growth, recruiting. We think that building a successful startup is hard enough that we need to leverage everyone's brain power.We're very happy to handle the H1B application process for foreign applicants. Interns are also welcome to apply; we have an intern program detailed at http://academia.edu/hiring.

      INTERN, H1B acceptableGeneralist or Backend EngineerPalo Alto - Tinfoil Security (http://www.tinfoilsecurity.com) - 500startups companyAbout Tinfoil Security:Tinfoil Security is the simplest way to secure your website. To the user, we provide an easy-to-use reporting interface that tells you where we found vulnerabilities, what they are, and provides a step-by-step wizard of how to fix them. Behind the scenes, we're crawling the site looking for every potential input vector and attempting to infiltrate, just like any external hacker would. The catch is we do this non-maliciously and without leaving a trace. Sound interesting?We're looking for incredibly smart guys (or girls) who like to get their hands dirty. If you don't know the answer, find it. If you can't find it, build it; but don't reinvent the wheel. If all the wheels suck though, build a better one.We're revolutionizing the stale and boring security industry, and making website and mobile security accessible to the world, so no business has to continue being the "low hanging fruit." It's absurd that security is only understood by so few developers and business owners in the world, when so much of it is actually pretty simple to understand. We want to change that. Join us.About you:You'll be employee #1.Our entire stack is Ruby at the moment, but we have a strong affinity for Python, Scala, and C, in no particular order. We're of the mindset that you pick the best tool for the job, much as you wouldn't hammer in a nail with a wrench (unless you didn't have a hammer and really needed to get it done fast).You'll be in charge of a large project, and will be given the ability to take charge of it and make it your own. On the flipside, you should be willing to take on that challenge.More than anything else, I can guarantee you'll have a boatload of fun, learn a ton, and produce software people really care about; lots of people.We offer significant equity, market salary, benefits, your choice of equipment, etc. We're based in Mountain View and are looking for people that can hack in the office with us.Please get in touch -- borski@tinfoilsecurity.com -- we'd love to chat. :)

      Software Architects/ Developers needed
Colorado / RemoteI'm working on a promising idea for TechStars Cloud (http://www.techstars.com/cloud/).  I'm designing a product around OpenStack technology that will bring cloud storage to the average business.  I'm looking for one or two developers with strong experience building back-end services to join me as co-founders for this venture.  During the TechStars application process, this position is unpaid.  We're working on this project in the evenings, after our full-time jobs.  It's a gamble, I know.  On the other hand, I think that we have a strong idea and if you join me now, we will be dividing our ownership of this venture equally amongst the three or four of us.For now, this product is being worked on remotely.  If selected for TechStars Cloud, we may continue to work remotely or we may converge in San Antonio, TX for the TechStars incubation stage.  Obviously, you must be able to work legally in the US.  No H1B sponsorship available.About me: I have 18 years of experience as an engineer in the Internet industry.  I've spent the last four years working with cloud computing for a major hosting provider.  This idea is the genesis of daily conversations that I have with customers.  It's a product that I think business is screaming for but nobody has perfected yet--and I think I know how to perfect it.If you think you have the chops to take on a project like this, send me your resume and some links to projects that you've worked on, preferably on GitHub or the like so that I can review your contributions.kumogumo@gmail.com

      San Jose - BVI Networks (bvinetworks.com). INTERN, H1B welcome.If you run an e-commerce website, you probably use google analytics, mixpanel or similar to track your customers and do some funnel analysis, A/B testing etc to optimize your site.If you run a physical retail store though, you're out of luck. How many people walk into my store and leave frustrated, without buying anything? Why isn't my hot new item selling - is no one seeing it, or are they seeing it but not buying because the price is too high? There's no easy way to find answers to these today.Not having cookies or IPs makes tracking in the real-world a real challenge! We primarily acquire data through machine vision algorithms that run against video cameras in the stores and identify and track people, but we also use data from a host of other technologies (RFID, WiFi, Zigbee, etc) to get the full picture.We just closed our series B, and are scaling very fast. We use C/C++, Java, Python and Flex. Our product runs on Linux. We like super-smart generalist hackers who like working on a variety of things - UI development, machine vision algorithms, AI, data mining/analytics on big data (last month we tracked nearly 2M people worldwide!).

      New York, NYBookish is hiring Scala and Rails engineers to work on a project that puts Reading Rainbow to shame.Lots of interesting work around recommendations, big big data, ereading, and everything in between.http://www.startuply.com/Jobs/Software_Engineers_Scala_Ruby_...
                      
                  
      How is Scala working for you guys? I am learning the language and trying to get it to catch on at my company (which uses a lot of Java but has really smart people who could pick up Scala easily IME).Having almost finished Odersky's book, I've reached the conclusion that Scala is somewhere between (a) the best language out there, and (b) at risk of getting into over-complex C++ territory. I'd have to take it to 25,000 lines at least before I could have a reasonably useful opinion on it. It looks fun, though.MongoDB: what are the advantages of it? How does that work out for you? "NoSQL" is interesting to me because I've never used any of those products. I worked at a company that tried to use sharded MySQL, which is pure hell if you want (a) anything more than a key-value store (because you're multi-sharding and have to keep consistency) and (b) performance at the same time.
                      
                  
      Scala has worked out very well for us. We introduced a similar stack (Scala services backend "data switches" with various front ends using the APIs. For your Java team Scala will be a snap to pick up, and undertaking to master. But the nice thing about is everyone can be fully productive as more and more advanced techniques find their way into code. Scala code can be made overly  complex in the wrong hands. So can Ruby and Python :)A lot's been written about why Mongo, what are problems it is singularly suited to solving. At Bookish, we're using Mongo for a use case clearly not well-suited to a relational structure, where the ability to query by elements other than document key are essential. So far so good.(Andy Parsons, CTO at Bookish)
