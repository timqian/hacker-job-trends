      Amsterdam, The Netherlands.Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a developer there and relocated over there about a year ago and have been very happy with it. We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation / visa issues.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.
We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it.You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.(This is a repeat of my January post (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3413911) since it still applies, including the keyword "H1B" because while it's not in the US we'll similarly assist with the Dutch equivalent if relocation is needed)

      I'm not looking at the moment, but just wanted to say kudos for your approach to remote work!I'm currently living mostly in rural France (with a month or two per year in Kuala Lumpur), working full time with a Cambridge-based startup that's even more accommodating of remote workers (and that's the only way I could possibly do this) -- many of us on the team travel & keep working, as well, which at one point resulted in us having one dev in GMT-8, one in GMT-5, one in GMT, and one in GMT+8 (!).There are some things that are more difficult with remote dev, mostly communication-related -- though if we all have good internet connectivity, we get by quite well -- but I've become fond of the hidden bonuses, like "relay" programming -- basically, pair programming where you only overlap for one part of the task, and the person who started it (in an earlier time zone) isn't the same one who finishes it.  It's always easy to do maintenance, deployments, etc. at "odd" hours -- you just pick the person in a time zone where the hour isn't so odd.  And generally our communication is good enough (and we share tasks enough) that no one is ever stuck sitting around waiting for X to wake up and come online.So best of luck to you, and I hope more startups will follow your lead!
                      
                  
      Being in rural France myself, I am interested in such open minded companies. Would you mind telling me who it is ? (if there are open positions).
                      
                  
      Patients Know Best (patientsknowbest.com) -- though we're not hiring aggressively at the moment (which is why we don't have an entry on this page otherwise...), I imagine it can't hurt to keep in touch if our mission looks interesting.Our webapp is currently old-school enterprise Java, partly because we're building atop a few major bits of OSS that are Java/JEE, but we're not opposed to becoming more polyglot as we expand.

      The typical answer is: "it depends on the team". Is there a particular part of Amazon that you are interested in?

Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 10-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc.
Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:
- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from
- every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer
- actively upgrading our version of Rails, and not stopping until we hit bleeding edge. We hit Rails 2.3.14 last week and hope to hit 3.0.11 within the month
- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise
- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves
Causes is a great place to better yourself and better the world. Apply through the site or adam@causes.com if interested!

You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.

It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam.

The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.Reactions to: dennis@quintel.com

      San Francisco, CAPagerDuty - http://www.pagerduty.comFULLTIME* Front-end Developer (http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/engineering/frontend-engineer)* DesignerWhat we do:At PagerDuty, we're building an alerting and incident tracking system that helps IT operations groups detect and respond to high-severity issues.We're not like the thousands of monitoring systems out on the market. In fact, we don't do monitoring at all. Instead, we plug into existing monitoring systems and handle the people part of the equation: alerting (via phone, SMS, email), on-call scheduling for teams, auto-escalation of critical alerts, and incident tracking.Our current product helps IT ops people know about critical problems as quickly as possible, collaborate as a team to fix problems quickly, and help track and improve incident response performance over time. Our vision is to expand into the event management space. This means treating data from monitoring tools as events and intelligently filtering and correlating events across monitoring tools in order to reduce the noise. It's like spam filtering for events: a critical problem, such as a bad deploy, will automatically alert the entire team via phone call, while a minor issue like a server going down in a fleet of 20 will only generate a low-priority email alert.Why you should work with us:We are different than many startups out there: we charge money for a product. Companies like Intuit, National Instruments, VMWare, Square and 37signals love our product; that's a lot to say for a system that frequently wakes our users up in the middle of the night. We're also fairly early stage (13 people plus a few interns). This combination means you'll get a market-rate salary plus a decent chunk of stock in a company that has already figured out product/market fit.We put a very big focus on the user experience (UI/UX), since some of our core concepts can initially be confusing to people who don't have a lot of experience in the operations and support realm. We want to guide people to use best practices whenever possible. Our customers span a gamut of sizes, from small start-ups just trying to monitor their websites to enterprise clients like Heroku who have to monitor thousands of servers and deal with complex infrastructural issues. As a result, our UIs have to scale and be intuitive with a wide range of data. Simply put, we're solving problems no one else has solved before, and we're doing so by designing clean, elegant, easy-to-use UIs.To apply, please send your resume to jobs@pagerduty.com.

      San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.Academia.edu has over 1.1 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011.
