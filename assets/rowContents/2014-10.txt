Chicago. New York City. San Francisco. Mountain View.Matasano Security / iSEC PartnersJob Title: Senior "three year endless winter whose storms rattle branches off world-tree, hearkening the end of this world, the rebirth of the next" Engineer.Startup devs work to build things people want. Matasano team members work to break things people want.This is, I expect, my last HN hiring post for Matasano. My last day is next Friday. Yggdrasil's branch has struck the world-serpent Jormungand, Heimdall strides towards the Gjallarhorn, the garbage around my desk is being picked up, the yeti pictures torn down.I confidently recommend Matasano. The team is amazing. There are too many great people here to list, but let me talk about a couple. Do these sound like roles you'd like to play?* The German PhD who hit the ground running as one of our best C/C++ vulnerability researchers, wrote the "idb" iOS analyzer, and schooled the rest of the team on timing attacks.* The person we moved from DC to Chicago, along with their... notable... Windows driver security and exploit development skills.* The Mountain View line-of-business web software dev we found who picked up a Rails CVE within an hour of looking at Rails for the first time.* The Santa Cruz shorts-and-flip-flops-wearing RTOS spelunker and Microcorruption coauthor; that guy has seen some shit.* The devops from STL who'd never so much as poked at a web app who implemented an impossibly tricky lattice-reduction+FFT cryptanalytic attack that Nate Lawson showed me as a joke, inside of a week.* The Chicago .NET dev who found us on HN and wound up writing half the crypto challengesI give up. This post would be 5000 words long if I tried to capture just one awesome thing about everyone I work with here. I will miss working with all of them terribly. You could be working with them now. I think you should!As Patrick McKenzie once put it: "If I were looking for a day job, I wouldn't be looking for a day job any more: they're friendly, happy people who get social license to join the Dark Side, do smart stuff all day, and then go home while it is still light out.".Matasano tries very, very hard to be cool about hiring. You can't waste their time, and they'll respect yours.www.matasano.com/careers

      To make it on-topic:Will Matasano continue its objective work-sample method of evaluating candidates?

Everyday we get to deal with a range of problems that few startups get to offer â€“ we have a modern web-stack, we need to use our cloud-clusters for the simulation half of the product, but also get to solve interesting physics/optimization problems on a regular basis (if that's your thing).â€“ Paul paul.gibbs@folsomlabs.com[1] http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/better-faster-ba....

      ScraperWiki.com is always looking for talented, generalist engineers - people
who can advance our products and build things for our customers.Location: Liverpool/Northwest UKWe're currently building https://pdftables.com which converts tables of data locked up
in PDFs into formats more useful for the general public. What sounds like a
boring problem actually requires quite a sophisticated approach - PDF's usually
don't have much in the way of useful structural information in them.As an engineer at ScraperWiki I can honestly say this is the most fun place I
have worked. My office offers an environment of self-determination, a chance to
explore all areas of the stack from product development to technical development, operations, security, product design and user experience.We have a generous holiday package and a guy in the office called Dragon. He
has a giant fluffy red beard and long hair and is generally an awesome guy.What more could one ask?We build things in Python, Go and Node, using Github, EC2 and salt - to name a
few things. Of you, we don't ask anything specific, but hopefully you can
demonstrate to us some decent experience in building interesting things. We
would expect someone who at least had a year or two's experience with Python
or experience equivalent to that.You can contact me personally or our CEO. Bonus points if you can crack the
puzzle:  UHR2IyNRbmJ6bCppaS1KfXF2fX1nMjZ+djluc3k9bWpCS0d

      Connexity - Camarillo/Los Angeles, CAWe're building a sophisticated advertising platform.  Actually, we've already built a ton of it.  In fact, it hums along running a few billion transactions per day.  As our business expands, we a few roles to fill:1) We need a Rails dev to own our campaign management interface. You'll help humans effectively manage hundreds of campaigns for well-known brands and retailers. We serve 50+ million ads every day and process 3.5 billion transactions, and you'll be right in the thick of it. You'll work directly with Postgres, Redis, HBase and Hadoop. You'll also likely play a key role in developing a new API for several key partners.2) We need someone with fierce tenacity to run QA and technical ad operations. When an account manager sees that we recorded no clicks for a certain campaign in Firefox browsers, you'll get to hunt down the resolution. You'd bring a meticulous eye for detail to bear with browser and Javascript chops. Done well, you'll be a daily hero. (Devs are cheerful when called upon to fight fires, but prefer to write code.) Count on becoming well acquainted with Hive.3) Finally, we're looking for a strong DevOps team member. You know networking and Linux very well. You'll help improve our Hadoop clusters. You'll tune monitoring and alerting thresholds. Most importantly, you'll eagerly seek to expand your usefulness as you work with the rest of the dev team. We're not driven by dogma, and you'll find yourself in good company if your sole priority is fixing the problem at hand.I'm one of the lead devs, and you can reach me at dlarsen@connexity.com. I'm happy to speak informally about our situation, and can hook you up with the HR folk at the appropriate time.

      Smarkets, London, UK. Sorry, no remote.We're always looking for generalist, python-happy software engineers. If you know, or want to learn erlang, even better.Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We're a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over Â£600 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too high, spelling for opportunity to do better.We're building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority. Whether you want to work on the trading exchange or the frontend, you'll be solving real and challenging problems - from scaling to optimising python to handling near real-time design constraints.The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around version control, configuration management and automated testing. We can, and do, deploy to production several times a day.Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Chef - but we are not resistant to change as needed.To see all our jobs, visit: http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/

      San Francisco - We're looking for engineers to join the web application team at Loggly. We're growing quickly and have multiple positions open, but right now we're very interested in Fullstack, Frontend, and UI Engineers.Who We Are:
Leader in cloud-based log management. Check out our site (www.loggly.com) for more information.Tech Stack:
We have a pretty sophisticated client written in Angular, and a backend written in Python (Django) and MySQL.What we're looking for:
Pretty much what any good engineering team is looking for: competent engineers. We're not looking specifically for people who are Angular or Django experts (although we certainly wouldn't hold it against you).That was vague, give me some specifics:
- You have had at least 3 years working on an engineering team (We're not at a place right now where we can help junior engineers succeed in their careers)
- You love what you do
- You know the basics, and you know them without hesitation. For example, if you're a frontend engineer, you should be able to do a basic 2 column layout in raw html/css without looking anything up or using bootstrap, or be able to implement a function like _.filter in 2 minutes (because you thought it was really easy since you understand javascript really well and you've worked with it enough where it's pretty much second nature to you)
- You ask questions when you're confused, and aren't afraid to push back or say no when someone asks you to do something that's a terrible idea. (Full points rewarded if you usually offer them an explanation of why that's a bad idea, and what it would entail to do it correctly, but you still get points for being able to say no)What we offer:
- Standard perks to make your life awesome at work, and outside of work (good pay, free meals, time off whenever you need it, healthcare, dignity... sorry, got carried away)
- An awesome team invested in making sure you succeedEmail vincent at loggly dot com with a resume, or a github link, or some kind of material that shows you're a good engineer.

We have a large application upcoming and are moving towards a REST architecture using javascript client-side and asp.net webapi backend. We're looking for a developer with experience in any client-side javascript technology (current line of thinking is to use angular, but open to alternatives) utilizing REST to become part of the team that designs and implements the platform. Knowledge of server-side factors of REST also desirable (ideally c#/asp.net/webapi but not required).If interested, contact me via email and I can provide more details.
