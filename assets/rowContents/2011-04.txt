Groupon is hiring all kinds of computery people in Chicago and Palo Alto - programmers, designers, operations, testing, support, Big Data, performance, managers, etc.Full listings at http://groupon.com/techjobsMost jobs are in both locations, and there's the ability to move or travel as desired.A couple months ago on this thread, I said Groupon was planning on hiring 100 engineers this year, and we're on pace to hit that goal.  The people we hired are so great that instead of work halting to train them, we have increased the rate that we release new features and products and our software quality has improved too.All tech people get a new MacBook Pro and monitor.  We use Ruby on Rails, git, RSpec, Cucumber, Selenium, Jenkins, and lots more good stuff.  We're the biggest player in the daily deal space so we face the biggest technical challenges - tens of millions of users, insane growth, real-time, data-based targeting at scale, defining the hottest new space (deals) on the Internet, etc.Usual official stuff aside, let me share my personal experience.  I started at Groupon four months ago and I'll say that it is better in every way than every job I've ever had.  My coworkers are amazing, we do all that stuff everyone says you're supposed to do (test coverage, automated builds, scope control, regression testing, etc), the atmosphere is so fun (company meetings are the highlight of the quarter), and everything I develop gets used by millions of people, immediately.  My mom actually understands who I work for.  I honestly legitimately love it here.
                      
                  
      Raleigh, NC - Generalist engineer (development/operations)The AgileZen team at Rally Software is looking to add a few engineers this year. Our app is a SaaS project management system that makes it easy for users to visualize their work.  While Rally's primary business is enterprise software, AgileZen's customers are primarily small teams and startups.We started as a two-founder startup in Ohio in 2009 and were acquired by Rally in 2010. We're now a team of four with intentions of expanding to seven by the end of the year. We think and act very much like a startup, report to the CTO, and operate with relative autonomy within the company.Experience in any development ecosystem (.NET, Java, Ruby, Python) is great, but JavaScript knowledge is a major plus. Our frontend is a whole bunch of JavaScript and CoffeeScript, and we're exploring doing more with Node.JS on the backend. We like people who are good at lots of things, and excellent at a few.Review My App link on HN (from our launch in 2009): http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=691673More about us at: http://agilezen.com/More about the job at: http://jobvite.com/m/?3ph32fwv
                      
                  
      Just seeing a job ad that mentions CoffeeScript is fascinating.  It's really a fun tool to work with.
                      
                  
      CoffeeScript is great -- it's (arguably) what JavaScript should have been, syntactically. We're really interested in finding new ways to use it, Node.JS being one of them.
                      
                  
      Whoa.  I'm looking for exactly this sort of job in Raleigh.  I just submitted my resume on your job site. Hit me up at wednesday @ gmail.com, I'd love to chat.

      that's really cool product you guys are developing! very impressed! just curious how you draw 3d? using 3d context in canvas or just plain 2d canvas context?
                      
                  
      Thanks, we are pretty excited about it! :-) We use WebGL for rendering on the client side. We have a custom 3D engine written just for Tinkercad. Our main UI guy is an ex game graphics/AI programmer http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/. He's done stuff like the Zen Bound iPhone/iPad game and AI for Crysis.If you are interested in seeing the rendering technology our viewer works for everyone, take a look at this bunny model:

      Would love to see a blog post about the tech behind this.
                      
                  
      I'm planning to do a few now that we start to emerge. Sign up for the mailing list or follow me on twitter, I'll announce the blog posts there.Basically we have a client side rendering engine combined with a cluster based solid modeling kernel. To get everything interactive we have pretty strict deadlines both for the server processing and for transferring the data to the client. I used to work at Google as systems programmer and even compared to that infrastructure this is pretty interesting and hard stuff.Edit: I'm @KaiBackman on twitter.

      Montreal - PHP/MySQL DeveloperAdult company, many positions available.  High traffic, lots of new products, different areas, including credit card processing.  Don't do one thing, do many things.http://gammajobs.com/Edit: Downvoted, I imagine, because it's an adult company.  If you downvoted this, at least you can have the guts to explain why?
                      
                  
      I would guess that it may have been seen as a joke.... "adult company"..."many positions available"... April Fools... Just a guess :)
                      
                  
      That's fairly observant.  Considering another post in this thread talked about joke posts.  sigh And I was serious.
                      
                  
      I'm guessing the initial downvotes are by anti-porn crusaders, and the subsequent downvotes are because you complained about being downvoted.
                      
                  
      Actually, I had -3 downvotes before complaining.  As for complaining, I think it's valid in this case.  I hate meta discussion as much as anyone else, but in this case, downvoters are imposing their views on others, and impacting those people from finding jobs.Basically, I don't care about the karma, but I honestly do feel that the downvotes were against the idea of HN.Plus, I'm sick today, and rather ornery.
                      
                  
      It could also be that there's a lot of hate for PHP on Hacker News for various reasons. Not saying that it's justified, though.
                      
                  
      I guess it's not hate, it's just that it's considered NSFW.
                      
                  
      I think it was the assumption that it was a joke (as another commenter pointed out) based on what was written.  Nothing about the post was NSFW, including the link.  In fact, if anything in the post was NSFW, then the problem lies with the place of work, not me.
                      
                  
      Facebook doesn't seem to have too much trouble attracting talent. (Personally I have little interest in working there, but PHP is only a small part of why.)

      Just to add to this:Our group has a lot of elements that resemble a startup. So for those of you who might be "lurkers" who are a bit afraid of a startup, our group can provide you with some of the benefits you might be craving: small team, interesting projects, wide technical leeway (we like the right tool for the job), and a fun work environment.Some of the things we've been using lately:- Python/Django- JavaScript (jQuery, Backbone, and many more)- Scala- Java (when we have to)- PHP- Objective-C (for mHealth iOS apps)What we really need for our current position is someone who has solid QA experience and is looking for a leadership opportunity. You would be starting from scratch in a very fluid environment and you would set the direction for our QA efforts. Our work is in research, which has traditionally  tolerated perpetual "beta" software, but we're trying to change that and build high quality "commercial grade" software. This includes not just traditional testing, but also defining repeatable processes for deployment, change control, system availability, etc...
                      
                  
      I'm a little confused... You describe a small team, interesting projects, wide technical leeway but the specific job your advertising here is one in QA... that person won't actually be able to exercise 'from scratch' development other than a test bed for QA...?
                      
                  
      We basically need a developer who can own QA, but we expect this person would also have opportunities to do from scratch development on some of our projects too. It's a hybrid role that requires just the right person, which is why we are reaching out here. What we are looking to avoid is someone who "puts up with" the QA because they are interested in the software development side of things. We would really like a QA person who also wants to dabble just a bit in regular "from scratch" development.

      Boston, MA - Engineers / Technologists / Programmers - not remoteWhy get drowned out in the Valley / SF when you can work on a sweet consumer web startup in Boston! OK I'll get it out of the way, the weather: well, yeah, there's snow/slush on the ground right now on April 1st (jokes on us), but it does make you appreciate when it is nice out a lot more.We're a new company (http://smarterer.com), recently funded, with some big ideas. Not only are we exploring a space with tons of potential, but we plan on putting "consumer web" back on the map in the Boston startup scene.There are just three of us at the moment (and only one tech person: me) so joining now means you get to have a big impact on the product, the company, the vision and the technology.There are lots of interesting product, algorithm, gaming, infrastructure and scaling challenges. We're currently using Python (not Django), but we're not language-religious, anyone who loves web tech, big problems, big systems, design, products and programming might be a good fit.Sorry, no remote right now. The early core team needs to be local to really gel (just from my personal and previous startup experience).if you're interested, email me: mikepk@smarterer.com

      Can't help but feel like this might be a bad day for this thread. You would think people could set aside the jokes in an obviously serious thread such as this one. Unfortunately, as evidenced by some of the submissions already, this seems not to be the case. Ugh.
                      
                  
      And you'd also think that people would stop taking themselves so seriously for a day that they could actually smile... but hey, what would I know?
                      
                  
      Employment is generally something about which you want to be serious.
                      
                  
      If somebody cannot distinguish real from fake jobs here then arguably the sort of jobs listed here will not really be aimed at them anyway...
                      
                  
      thats not true, its not very hard to create a fake listing that looks fairly real:social media startup startup.ly is now hiring: our stack looks like this: html5 frontend, node.js backend and nginx for static content.  We use redis for real time analytics, cassandra for our social graph, mongodb to store user data with an easy interface with node.  We are looking for people who know lisp, php developers need not apply.
                      
                  
      You know, I can't help but think that you might have thought my adult post was supposed to be a joke.  Considering the wording, I could understand how you might feel that way at first glance, but it was a knee jerk reaction.  So maybe you should try to take things more seriously.

For example:The Editor -- Our virtual styling tool features pretty nifty JavaScript.Style Analytics -- Our users interact with tons of products on a daily basis (50K clips/day, 35K sets/day), which makes for really interesting data mining opportunities.Monetization -- Think of Polyvore sets as user-generated ads.
