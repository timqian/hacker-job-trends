Buffer (http://bufferapp.com) - Anywhere in the world (we're a distributed team)I hope you are having a fantastic day. Happy new year :-)I'd love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We're a small team of 7, we have 450,000 users and are about to hit a $1M annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead and just around the corner we're expecting even faster growth through our mobile efforts.2 key areas we're looking for help with:    - JavaScript (+HTML5, CSS, Backbone.js) to lead our webapp 
      and browser extension development
    - DevOps (we're PHP/MongoDB on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and it's
      been put together by a couple of full stack hackers so there
      will be a lot that could be improved!)

If you're interested in coming on board, you will:    - work primarily with myself and my co-founders Leo and Tom
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great
      approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, itâ€™s cool if not)
    - be friendly and comfortable helping our users
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and
      support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup before (would
      be awesome, itâ€™s cool if not)

Youâ€™ll be amongst people who are striving for success and pushing themselves forward each and every day. Everyone here seems to progress at an incredible pace, we want to do everything to make that happen for you as well. Whether you want to start speaking, blogging, learning marketing or have other areas of personal growth, youâ€™ll have my personal support and the whole team as a resource too.Great salary and equity - $85k-$140k, 0.5-1.5%.If this sounds fun, let's have a chat. I'm looking forward to it! I'm Joel, drop me an email directly - joel@bufferapp.com.
                      
                  
      +1 for the transparency of the posting.  Getting the salary range out there, and the equity range out there makes a lot of sense.Quick tip:  People are somewhat jaded with platitudes like "be amongst people who are striving for success..."  Instead, try to bring out examples of the awesome Buffer culture.  What makes you quirky and rare?  What can you say about yourselves that few other startups would say?
                      
                  
      That's great advice Dharmesh, I think I can be much more specific there. Thanks for the heads up.For anyone reading who's interested, I think this might be the best example of how seriously we take self-improvement at Buffer:Each day we have a daily standup video call (Google Hangout) with the whole team. Each person has 3 minutes to talk. Like most standups, we talk about what we've done and what we're doing next. The thing that we do which I don't know that any other startups do, is that as part of that 3 minutes we also share a daily improvement. Something we're working on to improve ourselves. It can be related to Buffer, but usually it isn't. Some examples of improvements people have worked on: start blogging every 2 weeks, speak at first event, speak to a new person every day, learn japanese, wake up an hour earlier. We all encourage each other with our improvements, and this helps us push forward much faster than otherwise. It's a really positive environment and there is built in accountability.
                      
                  
      I think this is one of the best companies one could work for and learn from :)email sent.
                      
                  
      That list at the end reads like my personal checklist (even the Japanese, in particular). Let me attest to the value in all those activities.You pretty much stole my attention for the evening with that explanation. Good thing I've almost finished this short story outline! Look forward to an email from me.
                      
                  
      Would you be interested in interns?
                      
                  
      we're looking primarily for full-time help but definitely drop me a note anyway :-) joel@bufferapp.com
                      
                  
      Joel Just mailed you. Let's see what comes up.P.s: I am not an intern :)
                      
                  
      Two Sigma (SoHo, NYC) - Full Time, Intern, H1B

      Factual is currently hiring engineers and data lovers of all levels in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai.Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US ('exceptional' meaning you are a great engineer and have lots of machine learning/data extraction/NLP/etc. experience that is relevant to what we do).Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:Palo Alto Software Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Software engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Data Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews

      Amsterdam, The Netherlands. H1B[1]Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a developer there currently working on infrastructure tasks and relocated over there about three years ago, and have been very happy with it.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and a few CPAN modules.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers.You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a few times before andI've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent

      Radius Intelligence, San Francisco, CA.Full-time -- on-site only. INTERN and H1B welcome. Principals only please.Radius Intelligence provides data and tools to help companies reach over 20 million small businesses. Consider that many companies you read about here on HackerNews need to effectively reach these companies to sell to them. Payments companies, deals companies... you get the idea.The reason I joined Radius is two-fold: I want to work on products that can benefit small businesses and I like the fact that our product directly benefits from our work with data. We're selling the data we have with a cool web application, not using data science to get a 1% lift of clicks on the blue button.So we're looking for solid software engineers to work on all sorts of problems. We have a sophisticated web application implemented in Python and Javascript and we have our back-end data processing tech which is implemented in Java with Hadoop, Hive and HBase. We have paying customers, but we're on the ground floor with both -- now is the time to join us and make a huge impact. We also need an engineer who is interested in test and performance.Drop a line: jobs@radiusintel.com . Thanks.

      Localist - Baltimore, MarylandWhen we built Localist, we went back to the drawing board to revisit how people connect around events. Instead of looking at traditional online calendars and creating minimal, evolutionary changes, we started from scratch. The result is a complete rethinking of an online calendar, with Localist at the core; one that connects communities better than any website or social media campaign. We think of Localist as more than a calendar, just as a Content Management System is more than a collection of blog posts.Seeking:

      Seeking a data-loving sales person to lead the charge (REMOTE from somewhere in the bay area)AppMonsta sells data and insights to help businesses better understand the mobile app markets.  Our customers love us, we're bootstrapped and profitable, and we're growing quickly. We love hustle - we've been out hitting the streets as founders for the past year (we closed Neilsen and comScore starting with cold emails). Now it's time for us to bring a real pro - we've figured out the product and the market segments, and now we need someone who can use what we've learned to close a whole bunch of new customers.When we talk to prospects, we hear things like "We've been looking for a solution to this problem for the past three weeks.  This is EXACTLY what we were looking for".  There are tons of leads just waiting for someone to give them a demo and close them, as well as a ton of companies that don't know they want to talk to us yet (we usually come back from conferences with handfuls of business cards to give demos to).As our first dedicated sales person, there's a huge opportunity waiting for you (and responsibility to match).  You'll set the tone for our whole sales organization, and have the opportunity to grow into a very senior management role.  You'll be instrumental in helping develop a repeatable, measurable sales process.  At the same time, you should be comfortable with being the feet on the street while we ramp up.  We have had great luck with attending conferences, sending cold emails, and giving web demos to close new customers.Our entire team works remotely.  We're very flexible about where and when you work, as long as you're hustling, closing deals, and keeping our existing customers happy and paying.  Being in somewhere in the bay area is a big bonus, as both founders are here, as are a lot of our customers.  We try to get together at least once a week, and meet with our customers in person when we can.  We also provide everyone with a 4G LTE wireless access point so you can work from wherever suits your fancy.Send me an email at scotty@appmonsta.com and tell me what gets you fired up about selling.

We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. We gave a presentation on the upgrade at last weeks SF Rails meetup, slides at causes.github.com/migrating-rails-talk- Everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise (aka study hall).- Every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves.Causes is a great place to better yourself and the world. We're particularly looking for a:

We want to do it with Data, Algorithms and Design in a space that has traditionally lacked all three but is finally turning the corner (and fast).Most local businesses resort to unsustainable daily deals or boring Email Marketing to acquire and retain customers. We reject that status quo and our hundreds of (paying) customers agree. Weâ€™ve also developed a new search/crawl/tech-centric way of acquiring our own customers and disagree with the obsolete feet-on-street Sales model. The company is very small but generating material and predictable revenue; net revenue growth has exploded in the last 2 quarters.Our tech/product team is 6 at the moment and the company as a whole is 11; we're looking to at least triple the tech team size in the next 6 months. The tech stack is standard-issue Rails/HTML/CSS/JavaScript and is deployed on AWS. The product and tech team operates on 2 week sprints and there's a decent bit of Halo-playing and beer-drinking at the completion of sprint milestones.We also just launched with a $5.1M Series A in the press w/ TechCrunch, AllThingsD, GigaOm and VentureBeat.

At conferences, answering e-mailed questions, and (of course) chatting with them on Olark. Interacting with our customers has repeatedly gave us insights that couldn't have come from simply writing code.- We have project-based teams that shift (roughly) quarterly. We want to give our teams enough time to make sizable changes, but experience has taught us that iterations need an end date so we can collect feedback from real-world usage.### How to applyFor more details and to contact us, check out http://www.olark.com/jobs

We mask the complexity of ordering from lots of separate shops and allow customers to place a single order online and receive all their weekly shopping in one go. It's good for the shops because it lets them reach a wider audience, and it's good for our busy customers because it allows them to support their local community.We're looking for two developers, who will double the size of our current team, to work on our Rails based website and supporting applications. Ruby experience is a plus, but we're very happy to take on people without direct experience if they know how to learn - our second developer hadn't written any Ruby before starting with us.More details, including how to apply, are at http://developers.hubbub.co.uk/

      San FranciscoIntransRuby Engineers, Mobile Engineer, internsThe last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry. We are changing that.If you're ready to change the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to jobs@intrans.com. We're also looking for summer engineering interns.

      "PHP is a shallow and pendantic" Really? First of all, you're missing a noun. Second, you're not a PHP fan? Great, we get it, but maybe it wouldn't be the best thing ever to post that in a job post looking to attract talent. Or maybe you think it's easier to attract the right kind of talent? I love Rails, Python and nodejs as much as the next guy, but there's no such thing as the perfect tool for all the jobs.
                      
                  
      It was a joke, we're all polyglot developers. No need to take such great offense. Also, thanks for the correction, changing it in future posts.
                      
                  
      I second this. That little snarky comment was frankly a bright red flag - not least of which because of the typo.

Java, Scala, Backbone.js, Storm, RabbitMQ, Puppet, Sass, Responsive Design, Objective-C and on and on.
Ideal candidates probably have at least 5-7 years experienceHere's the "job description", if you are interested, you can email me directly: jconnolly@theladders.com--Weâ€™re looking for a few good programmers to join our team and help us achieve our mission of â€œthe right person for the right job.â€�Instead of giving you a list of buzzwords to describe the role, weâ€™ll tell you about a project we started recently:
A few months back, a small team of engineers and designers at The Ladders got together to design a new product. We started off by interviewing some of our customers to learn about their needs. Using that information, we held design studios and brainstorming sessions to flesh out what the actual features and user experience would be like.On the front-end, we decided to build a new Javascript-powered rich UI using responsive design techniques. Many people are working on responsive design for content-based sites, but few are doing it for browser-based applications.
On the back-end, we designed an Event Driven Architecture that makes use of Event Sourcing. Instead of updating a relational database in-place when things change, we store a series of discrete application events. We can then replay those events to create the state of the world at any point in the past, right up to the present. (Yes, weâ€™ve built a time machine!)Does this sound like the sort of thing youâ€™d like to do? If it is, weâ€™d like to hear from you.In return for your passion and commitment to code quality, youâ€™ll enjoy an awesome work environment with perks like: Unlimited vacation days! Yes, unlimited! Quarterly hackathons A game room and a well-stocked kitchen Exciting events including holiday parties, picnics, talent shows, pumpkin carving and more Company sponsored athletic teams Competitive salary, bonus and stock options Health/Dental/Vision Insurance, 401K

      Dropcam, San Francisco, CA. Full-time and intern (onsite only). https://www.dropcam.com/jobsDropcam's cloud service accepts more incoming video per minute than YouTube. We make a Wi-Fi camera and cloud service that allows users to monitor their home or small business from anywhere in the world using apps for iOS, Android, PC, and Mac.We have some of the most challenging software engineering problems in the world, e.g.:  * streaming low-latency, live video over consumer wifi networks
  * storing up to 30 days of video per camera
  * analyzing video for significant events (computer vision)
  * refining a user experience that "just works" whether you are sharing babies'
    first steps or catching a burglar (or monitoring your pets, keeping an eye on
    your small business, providing in home medical care...)

Here's just a couple of the articles written about us this year:http://allthingsd.com/20121227/the-story-of-dropcam-a-little...http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/11/nyregion/an-improvised-tra...We are hiring software engineers and product managers (both software and hardware). Dropcam is an amazing place to work. Why? Here are just a few reasons:  * Spend more time working on the product vs being in meetings.
  * Every employee can access our sales dashboard so you know how the company is 
    doing/growing. (5x annual revenue growth in 2012)
  * We bring in catered lunch every day but not dinner, so you don't feel bad going 
    home to recharge.
  * Like big data? We measure it in Petabytes, not Terabytes (unlike your average
    "web scale" startup :)
  * I personally fly employees on helicopter tours of the San Francisco Bay (you 
    can even bring friends). It's a lot of fun!

      EasyESI (http://easyesi.com) - Berkeley, CA - full-time, H1B welcomeWe are a 6-person, tech-led startup that nearly hit breakeven last year and just closed a funding round. We are looking to fill 3 positions:Front-End/UI Engineer - Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.Software Engineer - With just 2.5 programmers right now (our CEO has a CS PhD but a lot of other responsibilities), we all wear many hats. Our server is written in Java 7 and runs on the latest Jetty. We use Hibernate and Spring with annotation-based configuration (minimal XML). We use Lucene for indexing documents, Cassandra for logging and searching user events, MySQL for storing relational data, and it all runs on AWS technologies. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We just recently ordered a 48-bay fileserver (basically a more robust, beefed-up BackBlaze pod) to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust. We're happy to hire someone with solid fundamentals who wants to learn on the job.Salary is competitive with other Bay-area startups. We also offer equity, healthcare, 3 weeks of vacation and 10 holidays, and a relaxed and fun work environment.We consider all applicants; please apply for the position(s) you're interested in at http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml.

      MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns welcome, H1Bs probably welcome but I'm just an engineer so don't ask me.MokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into "layers", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)See mokafive.com for more info, or send me an email (gthomas at that domain name).

You need to give it an A record, and have the webserver handle it.

      It's funny how you classify Scala, Java coders as engineers and PHP coders as developers. I know it wasn't probably intended, it's just funny. :)
                      
                  
      All of the jobs I looked at the description for have "Min Experience: Experienced." I just graduated in December; is Tumblr looking for new grad hires?

      Bubbli / Aria Glassworks - SF / RemoteWeâ€™re looking for an experienced developer to assist in development of our python backend and API (theyâ€™re the same thing!) for our mobile app and web presence (and maybe third parties one day). This developer will start on a contract basis, remotely with a 2-3 month term, with the possibility of becoming full-time. We use github, gchat and email to communicate asynchronously, but we'll fly you out to our offices every once in a while if you're not already local.We run a very modern stack - nginx, gunicorn, puppet, celery, aws, redis & postgresql. Our web API (what you'll be working on), is tiny. It uses our own micro-framework (1148 lines of python) specifically for writing APIs built on werkzeug (from the flask family), sqlalchemy, 1161 lines of â€œbusinessâ€� logic and 798 lines of tests. Much of the base functionality is complete (itâ€™s actively serving our mobile app), which means the next stage -- your primary responsibility -- is scaling this code and optimizing it all while continuing to strive for irreducible complexity.Day to day projects may include (but arenâ€™t limited to):* Implementing sharding logic in our python code* Porting our code to use gevent/eventlet* Profiling hot code areas and potentially rewriting them in C* Investigating whether PyPy makes senseIn addition - you may be â€œon-callâ€� to address server issues while you are actively working (read: sitting at a desk). If/when you transition to full-time these responsibilities may increase.Bubbli is building the technology and products to make bubbles. Bubbles are completely seamless spherical photos that you view through the window of a portable device. We think they're the most compelling means for communicating the real world on the flat web and millions of dollars of VC funding would seem to agree with us. What we've built so far has actually become surprisingly meaningful in our own lives (in capturing moments important to us when photos aren't enough) to the point where we would be seriously sad if the world didn't have it.We're about ready to launch our first iOS app imminently and we need to bulk up the team to support things when our app explodes in popularity. We're a tiny 4 person company (2 programmers, 2 designers) company based in San Francisco. We pay well, we're nice guys, and if you come on full time a few months in, you'll get full benefits, a 401k, and equity.Since we haven't launched, you can google for more...Shoot me an email at ben@bubb.li if interested.Also - a part time CM needed too!

      Mapquest.comPrimarily in Denver, CO and Lancaster, PA, but we're a relatively distributed company so go ahead and ask if you live somewhere else. As an AOL subsidiary, we've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't be unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got too much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management team to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering the ? "How do I get there?" to answering the more interesting ? "Where do I want to go?" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly known as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven culture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing products that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire engineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at varying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java developer to work with our data team and revamp various backend services (i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location databases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase "T shaped" has been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be able to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if you've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in someone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we have many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry knowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and directions. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be expected to be able to "talk shop" with the engineers you work with, but your day- to-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing ideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and designers see them through to completion.I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The office space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the new management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot the company away from directions and into product development. The brand is practically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for feedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to work like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we had 40M UV's on a brand new product on launch day, for example). You can read the company postings here (http://company.mapquest.com/careers/) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please feel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything else. Happy 2013, and hope to hear from some of you soon!
