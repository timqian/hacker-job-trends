      What technologies are you working with on your infrastructure and backend?
                      
                  
      Without Perl (sic!) you wouldn't have your Ruby and your Python. Rails - poof! Data science - poof! Perl laid the groundwork. It's flexible and intuitive. And I've seen people abuse it like no other. Perl got its "bad" rep not because of the language itself, but because of the people who lacked discipline, diligence and skill.
                      
                  
      I've coded in pearl and read code in pearl. Sure, it got a bad wrap and yes people did stuff you shouldn't have. However, all that is part of the language / community. Pearl isn't great to code in for the reasons you mentioned, regardless of how useful it was in the past.To put as an analogy, pearl is like an iron or bronze blade, top of the line at the time. Now we have a ton of improved metals to choose from - steal, tungsten, titanium, etc. With improved method of producing ever sharper blades. Why would I want to use the old technology? Sure it can get the job done, but it's tougher to use, and rusts quicker.If it helps, I also think the same of JavaScript. There are many faults that make it more difficult to code in than necessary.For both its a preference shared by many, and being a software engineer we can probably pick (some of the time) what jobs we do, so we can avoid jobs with antiquated or difficult programing languages to use. Of course, I use JavaScript (and even some Pearl) regularly because I need to.Finally, ill be honest, I know like 2 decent pearl developers and neither recommend using it / getting into a position maintaining it.
                      
                  
      I'm sure you mean Perl without the A. With the A it's an older unrelated language.

      Wait, this is weird. The SEC development branch chief is posting this on behalf of the contractor performing the role? Why?Jordan, why isn't Aretec posting this one? They should be the ones trying to staff the roles if they own the contract, no? I say this because seeing the government overseer doing the contractor's job doesn't breed faith in the contracting org.
                      
                  
      The SEC has more credibility than their no-name contractor, but limited ability to hire (Gov).So, they hire/manage through contractors.Personally, I view the fact that the SEC branch chief is posting this as very positive, since it indicates a real investment on the part of the client, as well as a close working relationship.
                      
                  
      That's an interesting perspective. I suppose either could be true and it would be hard to discern without a more direct conversation with the government liaison (in any circumstance, not just this one).I'm not used to seeing this pattern with the agencies I've consulted with, so maybe that's where my bias comes from.
                      
                  
      Is aretecinc the official recruiting company for the SEC?
                      
                  
      That's not how it works. They're not hiring for Government positions, they have a contract (possibly a subcontract under another company) to do coding for the SEC. The Government is the customer, not the employer.
                      
                  
      The title SEC seems rather misleading then.
                      
                  
      Especially considering that the SEC[0] directly posts in Who's Hiring threads.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11405745
                      
                  
      Lots of interesting roles -- any of them open in an internship capacity?

      This is exactly why companies in these threads don't put salaries because of people like you.By the way, no other REMOTE company in this thread has a salary range.
                      
                  
      > ...because of people like you.Your generalization is not true. There are many reasons why a company does not want to post salary ranges and I'm quite sure that direct and non-hostile feedback about how copy for a job posting on Hacker News might be interpreted, is a small maybe even insignificant, reason.
                      
                  
      I don't mean to make it sound like we are trying to short-change anyone. We are simply looking for great candidates wanting to live in beautiful southern Idaho. (And say that cost of living in this area is much lower than many other parts of the country). But, I can see where you can interpret my comments like that.
                      
                  
      I don't even know you so don't take what I said personally, I was attempting to be helpful :)I think stating the salary range and then providing examples of the CoL in the area without trying to justify the salary range in comparison to it is the best way to advertise the position.Saying what you just said: We are looking for great candidates wanting to live in beautiful southern Idaho is compelling too (for people wanting to get away from the huge and congested cities).Anyway, random internet stranger conversations, take it all with a grain of salt :)
                      
                  
      FWIW, I think the comparison is fair if you swap out CA for the insanity of housing prices in the bay area. I do think that the brutal winters of Idaho should be accounted for though. If you're trying to convince people to move to Idaho, you might need to pay a little closer to sunshine salaries to make up for negative degree weather.
                      
                  
      Idaho weather really isn't brutal unless you are in the north or way up in the mountains. Its really quite nice in Southern Idaho. Hot summers, absolutely perfect long falls and springs and occasional snow in the winter but it rarely sticks for more than a few days. Negative degree weather is also pretty rare. Very dry and little precipitation, again unless you are up in the mountains. The number of Californians that have moved to Idaho over the last 10 years is pretty staggering. The weather didn't stop them!
                      
                  
      I'm actually impressed! Sounds almost as nice as Colorado weather. ;)And yes, we also get a lot of people (myself included) who are escaping from California for various reasons. Considering the number of people who leave California, it's almost surprising that California's population is still growing, though I believe it is.
                      
                  
      I can vouch for it being beautiful.

      Hi there! Any chance you'd allow folks in Baltimore to avoid two beltways and work remotely the majority of the time?
                      
                  
      Heads up, I applied with these guys and it was a great process overall.I ended up not getting extended a position but they were still a great group of people. From what i can remember there was remote work available to an extent but it was mainly working together with the rest of the team in the office since they are small.
                      
                  
      Hey, I'm one of the cofounders of Nava. We currently are only hiring for on-site roles, as we find physical presence to be essential for much of our work. However, we have a flexible work policy that in practice shakes out to many people working from home around one day/week.

      Hi! Just in few words. What's your interview process like?
                      
                  
      My experience as a holder of a degree in STEM (not CS) is that if you have experience even people who say "degree in CS" don't actually care. I display my degree prominently on my resume but no one ever brings up the fact that it isn't CS (except rarely when it might be relevant to the subject matter of the company, then it's a bonus.) I wouldn't worry so much about the language on the req.
                      
                  
      Well if all the seniors at your text/telco company agree with that it must be true!
                      
                  
      They are the people hiring us all, so, uh, kind of?
                      
                  
      I work for a tech/telco company in London and all the seniors agree that CS degrees now are totally useless and don't make you any better at CS.You might want to consider forming a perspective on this topic with some basis other "what the senior developers at my company say".
                      
                  
      Since it's seniors who hire, i'de say it's pretty important whether they value it or not. And a lot don't, especially for networking since CS has almost no networking in it (by the 2nd year most undergrads still have difficulty working with binary, i.e. netmasks, cidr's, wildcards, etc.).

      Boeing Research & Technology | 3D Designer - Unreal Engine | Brisbane | ONSITEHi folks. Interested in building the future of aviation? Come join a mixed reality research and development team within The Boeing Company, based in Australia.The successful applicant will work within a small team of mixed reality specialists who are tasked with developing innovative enabling technologies for application within new and existing Boeing products and programs. The researcher will perform a variety of research activities focused predominantly within the field of Virtual Reality. Applicants must be Australian Citizens to meet defence security requirements.Submit a resume and link to a portfolio here [1]. Applications still open.[1] https://recruit.boeing.com.au/jobtools/jncustomsearch.viewFu...
                      
                  
      Please note that when readers see "Boeing" and an unqualified "Brisbane", it's natural for us in the other hemisphere to assume Brisbane, California.A qualifier on your title lines (e.g. Brisbane, Australia or even Queensland) would be helpful.
                      
                  
      I'm Australian so I'm biased but completely disagree. You're saying that the city with a population of 2,308,700 is the one that requires qualification so it doesn't get confused with the one that has 4,282?
Great startup scene in Brisbane!!
                      
                  
      I'm not Australian, but come from a cricket-playing nation, and I agree with you. I'm more familiar with the Brisbane that houses The Gabba :)
                      
                  
      Cheers, I wasn't aware of any other Brisbane's world wide. I'll clarify next time.

      To be fair, it actually does say "or equivalent experience."  So (in theory) a code camp background shouldn't count against you.But yes, it's something of a faux pas for them not to say as much in their writeup, e.g. "code camp graduates with significant industrial experience are warmly encouraged to apply."  Keeping in mind that this is not an entry-level position, after all.

      WalmartLabs - Clojure Developer. | SF | Remote (US Timezones) | H1B VISA
You can work on Clojure at quite a few companies, but rarely can you impact millions of people at such a personal level. We're a small, flat team of engineers building mission critical applications for Walmart. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. We use pull requests & code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.
Some aspects of our work that are important to us:  - high performance distributed systems
  - robust & well-factored codebases
  - simple & fast deployments
  - automating the hell out of operations
  - thorough system test coverage
  - managing our own development process and work backlog
  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)
  - contributing back to the clojure & open source community
What we do:  - write all our production systems & tools in Clojure
  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems
  - spin up web services for handling large volumes of data
For a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk we gave at Clojure/West. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4.

You'll be helping build some of the foundational services that run Twitter's infrastructure.(And if that doesn't sell it: we've tested new features by rebooting enough computing power to land on the Top500.

      Can you explain a bit for us how "come work at a company that's actively laying people off" would be compelling?
                      
                  
      So as to be fired?

      The Climate Corporationhttp://www.climate.comWe have offices in San Franscisco, Seattle, Chicago, and Saint Louis, onsite only.We're looking for senior software engineers (10+ years.) We have a lot of Clojure and some Scala here, any FP experience is good though. There's also a lot of Python, Ruby, and R laying around, but mostly just legacy stuff. We handle a lot of data, experience handling a lot of data or distributed systems is a big plus. We're processing satellite imagery for many states every day, all in AWS.Fair warning, our parent company is Monsanto, and some people might have an issue with that. On the upside, you'll get to work with for-real scientists on a daily basis and Monsanto has excellent benefits. And we have lots of for-real paying customers.Please email me at chris.gore@climate.com if you are interested, thanks.
                      
                  
      > Fair warning, our parent company is MonsantoI respect you guys for stating this upfront. Hope you find someone suitable.
                      
                  
      Thanks.I don't have a problem with GMOs (I'm really into genetics personally, I did natural computation during my MS thesis).
And the lawsuits against farmers seem reasonable given their seed contracts, more reasonable than software patents or EULAs to me.But I know some people disagree about that.
                      
                  
      A friend of my father used to be a researcher at Monsanto, so he explained a lot of the basics behind what they're doing to me. Absolutely amazing tech to be frank.So yeah, I personally don't have a problem with GMOs either, but as you mentioned, some people might.
                      
                  
      In-Q-Tel (IQT) | Arlington, VA | Technology Architect, Software Engineer, Network Architect | www.iqt.orgWeâ€™re looking to grow our team in our Arlington, Virginia office across several groups. Currently, weâ€™re looking for folks interested in working in a role like mine (which we advertise as a â€œTechnology Architectâ€� on our website) where we partner closely with the United States Government to help introduce innovative technology solutions in support of mission, perform tech diligence on potential investments (and help craft how to adapt and deliver them), and generally spend our days exploring emerging tech.Additionally, we have a few openings in our Cyber Reboot lab (http://www.cyberreboot.org/careers/) for software and network engineers. Our Cyber Reboot lab is one of our newest and the problem space is really interesting so if cyber security/networking is your thing itâ€™s a great place to land as you get to work with academia, many very interesting friends from one of our other labs â€“ Lab41.We are a relatively small crew and I can attest the organization feels like a startup (even inasmuch as we cater lunch on Mondays and Wednesdays and have nifty standing desks). Several of us came from venture-backed startups, some have left to start them and the problems you get to work on are definitely unique. Our lunches tend to morph into lunch-and-learns as we have folks spanning the academic/technical gamut from microbiology, NLP, computer vision, â€œnetwork securityâ€� and things that involve space.The interview process is a phone screen or two, an in-person with a handful of folks and no coding challenges. Weâ€™re looking for teammates who want to work on a unique mission. Mastery of C++, familiarity with Torch or a PhD in EE are great things to have but what we want is a teammate who can learn tech or domains theyâ€™ve never worked in, cook up new ways of thinking about the application of existing technology and help support technical innovation in the government. As far as we can tell thereâ€™s no test for that, so we just talk to you and make sure you get coffee or water and whatnot.Apply here: https://careers-iqt.icims.com/jobs/ or send an email to mjackson [at] iqt.org
                      
                  
      Kaggle | San Francisco | Full Time | ONSITE or REMOTE | Software EngineeringTechnologies: C#; ASP.NET MVC; React; TypeScript; Docker; Azure.You can read the job req and apply here: http://kaggle.applytojob.com/apply/GjSjOi/Backend-EngineerKaggle is best known as a platform for machine learning competitions. We have a community of 700K data scientists. Now also building a sharing-and-collaboration platform (closest analogy is Github for data science: https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)Particularly interesting opportunity for software engineers looking for exposure to data science/machine learning.Three of our engineers have come via HN posts, so we take HN referrals very seriously.
                      
                  
      This one has left me with a particularly bad impression since they specifically say they take referrals from HN very seriously.I don't recall being asked if I found out about them from Hacker News (I did), but they did ask me to provide links to LinkedIn, Twitter, StackOverflow, and GitLab/GitHub profiles.Here's the grand sum of response so far, I think I've waited as long as is reasonable to share.  It's been well over a month.  No other contact.  Thanks for your interest in Kaggle. This is
  an automated message from Kaggle's applicant
  tracking system to confirm that we have
  received your application and will review
  it in the next seven days.

Don't promise anything about 'seven days' if you aren't going to at least respond with an automated email saying you threw the application out after a quick glance.
                      
                  
      I'm sorry you had a bad experience. Would you mind emailing me at a@kaggle.com? I'd like to look up your profile to see what happened. I'm in charge of recruiting so it's my fault if your application slipped through the net.ps. The way we have historically known that the postings came from HN is by using a custom URL: http://kaggle.applytojob.com/apply/GjSjOi/FullStack-Engineer....I just noticed that the URL was missing from this month's link and last month's link. (This month I just copied last month's post.) Again, Glad that this was pointed out.
                      
                  
      Thank you for the nice response.I may have used too harsh a tone in my earlier message, so I apologize if you felt attacked.If you are tracking HN referrals with a special URL, you wouldn't have known I came from HN.  I found your site and the Careers link from a Hacker News post that was not a hiring advertisement.  Maybe you could allow people to self-identify their affiliation instead.Unfortunately, I see no benefit I might gain by reaching out to you directly.  I have posted a negative review of your company's hiring process in a public forum.  If I was interested in applying for your current or future openings, that probably wouldn't help my case.I'm happy to have helped identify any issues with your process, and again apologize for the tone in my previous post.
                      
                  
      You're right: we will miss people with this way of tracking referral source. I'm actually less concerned about this issue than when I first posted on HN. We now only post on HN, Stack Exchange and Github and we've found that the quality of the candidate pool is much higher than when we posted more broadly. I view HN, Stack Exchange and Github as equally credibly sources, so distiguishing HN from other sources is less important for us now than it was a few months ago.Re harsh feedback, I understand the perspective, but think it's actually not such a big issue for us for two reasons:
1. as a culture, we strive to give each other direct feedback, so your comments are in keeping with a culture that we aspire to
2. on a more light-hearted note, FAR more harsh things have been said to us on the Kaggle forums. Helps us develop a tough skin :).
                      
                  
      This interaction seems to have gone well on both sides, leaving me feeling particularly warm. As a member of the peanut gallery with no stake in the outcome of this interaction, I'm nonetheless glad this was sorted out!

      Wellframe | Healthcare | Boston, Ma | Onsite/FulltimeAt Wellframe, we are building an intelligent care-management platform that allows health plans and care-delivery organizations to better manage large populations of complex patients. Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patientsâ€™ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We're currently looking for several mid/senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra/platform, sre) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you're in the area I'd love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you're actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products. We're currently running most of our API on Rails but heavily migrating toward Scala for most of our backend/data services.

      I've seen posters for the Edinburgh DC throughout some of the Amazon offices in Seattle and it looks like you guys are doing cool stuff :). I'm not looking to change teams right now, but I'll probably get in touch sometime in the future since I lived in Scotland for 7 years (Aberdeen) and I'd love to get back someday.Out of curiosity for myself and others, is there a preference for local candidates over moving US based people over (whether internal or external)?
                      
                  
      We definitely are doing interesting things here, and across a wide range of different projects too!
We are looking worldwide for people to join our team as we big growth plans here in Edinburgh, so no real preference on current location.
                      
                  
      Wow, that's swell. And thank you for posting that here instead of sending an internal email or something.By the way, when you said "proceed to the next stage", did you mean the stage where you play dead recruiter and I pretend that nobody warned me about this?
                      
                  
      Do you take international interns as well?
I am a junior who is really interested in one.
                      
                  
      We are not able to sponsor Visa's for our internships, but if you already have the right to work in the UK then please do apply.
                      
                  
      Do you happen to know of any other Amazon offices who are willing to takes international interns, this seems to be the reason I don't get interviews so it would help to know from the beginning.
                      
                  
      Im afraid I do not. For many locations the Visa requirements will be prohibitive for short term internships, but that varies heavily between offices.
                      
                  
      Wow, I'm sorry to say this, but the website through which we submit an application (icims) is awful. I get it that Amazon doesn't want to be liable to lawsuits etc, but the website is very bad.
