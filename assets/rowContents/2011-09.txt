Chicago, New York, San Francisco Bay AreaMatasano SecurityJob Title: They look and before them is a pale horse, and its rider was named memory corruption, and hell followed close behind.We're looking for people who can do Ruby. And C. And Python. And Java. And Scala. And asynchronous network code. And MySQL. And Redis. And C++. And MongoDB. And Riak. And Berkeley DB. And kernel drivers. And x86 assembly. And Objective C. And block ciphers. And digital signatures. And hash functions. And iOS development. And template metaprogramming. And ARM assembly. And MIPS assembly (yes really). And FIX protocol. And market order management systems. And Android systems programming. And Javascript. And Rails. And Django. And statistics. And linear algebra. And graph theory. And SAT solvers. And signal processing. And software radio. And soldering. And hardware debugging.Knowing all that on day one would sure be nice, but it's enough for us that you (a) can code well in something and (b) want to do all that stuff.We're looking for someone who could work at any of the largest or best software companies in the world, so we can work with them at all of the largest and best software companies in the world. Matasano Security is one of a small number of firms that specializes in software security. People contract us to beat the living shit out of their code before they ship it to customers. So a vindictive streak is helpful, but not required.I wrote down everything I could think of about our hiring process here:http://www.matasano.com/careersFull benefits. Market comp. Infinite free books from Amazon. Smart coworkers.My contact information is in my profile.
                      
                  
      This sounds like a dream job.That said, no matter how much you stress that candidates don't need to master all these skills on day one, I can't help but feel overwhelmed by your requirements. I feel like people with the combination of skills you are looking for might be quite rare (expertise both in web development AND system programming AND security).Case in hand: I'm a passionate developer with an expertise in Java web development / Javascript (who dabbled a little with Clojure / Scala). I love my craft and keep improving, but I haven't yet gotten around and/or felt the need to learn about Ruby / Python / Objective C / NOSQL and all the system / network programming (assembly, C, kernel drivers, hardware debugging...). Sure, I'd love to do all that stuff, and security fascinates me, but I feel like it'd take YEARS to learn and master all these skills (more if I also want to stay current with the JVM-related stuff).Would Matasano have any use of a guy like me with expert-knowledge in a relatively specific field (web development and the JVM), but who wants to learn about all the other stuff? Or should I learn about these skills on the side and apply in a few years once I've improved my system programming and read K&R? ;)Another example could be a python web-app developer who is interested in security, but never really did any systems programming.[I wasn't sure whether I should comment on HN or send you an e-mail, but I think the answer might interest other people]
                      
                  
      Good. If I thought it'd be clear enough, I'd say that the second most important qualification for a role her --- after "ability and enthusiasm with code" --- is being comfortable with being overwhelmed. A typical project in my field is just a few weeks long, with just a few teammates, where by the end of the engagement you need to be standing triumphantly in the smoking crater where a system that took anywhere from 1-8 years to build once stood.We're not looking for someone who can recite chapter in verse from the GNU Radio documentation or write a compelling essay on category theory or even take the determinant of a 4x4 matrix. We just want people who are comfortable with the idea of becoming able to do those things. With, like, a day's notice. :)You cannot possibly waste my time by emailing me. Even if we're not a great fit today, I can tell you more about my field and software security in general. Write me anytime.

      Pune, India - we are looking for a general purpose developer who is smart and gets things done.We are building a search engine/knowledge representation system for fashion.http://styloot.com/parametric_search/search/dress-searchThe best way to describe working here is to describe my last month: I built a document classifier (based on max entropy), a backbone.js app, fixed bugs in django-tyrant-cache and started building a NoSQL database which supports color-based queries ("find all the items with color similar to #df3426" [1]). Your job will be to do similar things.(If all that stuff sounds out of your league, it sounded out of mine too, until I got started.) We use javascript, python/django, hadoop, and haskell, though we really don't care if you've never touched any of those technologies.Contact info is in my profile. Send a link to your github or other work you've done if you are interested. Here is our github: https://github.com/styloot[1] We aren't jumping on a silly NoSQL bandwagon. It's very easy to compute l^p distances on RGB records in your favorite SQL database, but RGB doesn't map very well to human perception of color.
                      
                  
      look into mongoDB's geospatial indexing, don't reinvent the wheel.
                      
                  
      Mongodb spatial indexing is 2d ([x,y]), as far as I know, so that would only work if we didn't have any items with a blue channel (rgb(x,y,0)).Regardless, that's all Euclidean. Human perception of color follows the CieLAB non-metric. (It's basically just a function of two variables, since it satisfies neither the triangle inequality nor symmetry.)
                      
                  
      Interesting CieLAB (Never heard of it before,but just looking through it). Function of two variables, yeah that makes sense as neurologically we have found only two types of neural cells in the retina (rods and cones).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell

      Akamai Technologies is looking for software, QA, network and systems engineers in the following locations:  Cambridge, MA, USA
  San Mateo, CA, USA
  Bangalore, India

We're also hiring for many other roles in these locations as well as many other places around the globe.I've been working here for just over a year as a Sr. Software Engineer, and this is just a great place to work. The company is very technology driven, creativity is encouraged, and while we are very robust and careful in our practices and procedures, (especially operations and release management) I feel like  developers and managers are given a lot of independence to make important technical decisions, which leads to giving us the ability to really make a difference with every thing we do. That's something special to have in a company of this size, IMO.So, the careers page is here: http://www.akamai.com/careersI know my group is looking for skilled SQA engineers, but company-wide we need everything from battle-hardened linux admins to C++ gurus, to Java/Perl/Python hackers and everything in between. My own group develops in Clojure. My co-worker is currently prototyping algorithms in Haskell.Since I do get a referral bonus, don't forget to send them my name if you submit a resume!

I went all in and quit mine a few months ago (freeeeeedommm!!).Social Tables is a web-based seating chart designer for weddings and other events with assigned tables. We help event/wedding planners create floorplans and assign their guests seats. We're called Social Tables because we have a social feature that lets guests meet who they'll be sitting with beforehand.

We've been self-funded to date and are currently talking to interested angels.Like I said, I'm looking for a CTO (understanding of Rails is a must, love for SproutCore is a big plus).

NetflixI'm hiring for my team (although there are a ton of other jobs too)The description is a little light on programming, but it really is more programming than sysadmining.Netflix is a very open environment -- any engineer can push code to production pretty much any time with almost nothing in the way.  There is no release manager or schedule.  Maintaining reliability in this environment is a fun challenge!Our team has three main goals:* Write tools to help the other engineers know when it is safe to deploy.* Create monitoring tools to detect issues before users do, fix them automatically if possible, and if not, contact the right people as quickly as possible.* Take charge of outages and lead the calls until they are resolved and then follow up to make sure the root cause has been found and fixed.So if this sounds like something interesting to you, you can send your resume to me at jedberg@netflix.com, and if you have any questions about the job, feel free to comment here (but don't email for questions, because I'd rather answer them here were everyone can see the answer).Here's a discussion about the job on reddit:http://www.reddit.com/comments/jyaqd/Here is the full job description from the jobs site:Netflix is the world's leading streaming video service, and our growth is accelerating.

You are a talented devops engineer and you thrive on managing and maintaining a reliable environment that others depend on.You possess these qualities:* You see the big picture delivering a 24x7 service* You are effective working with multiple teams* You have high standards in everything you do* You can balance multiple tasksYou have these skills:* Great communication skills, both verbal and written* In-depth experience operating a 24x7 production environment* Fluent in Linux: RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu* Strong scripting and programming skills (weâ€™re going to ask you to write code on the whiteboard)* Familiar with the Java platform, especially JVM configuration and JMX* Knowledgeable in Linux packaging tools: rpm, yum, dpkg, apt* Ability to quickly triage problems, determine root cause and drive resolution* Ability to keep a cool head under pressure and effectively participate in system down crisis situationsYou may even have these skills:* Expertise in one or more of the following: Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, shell* Prior experience with Amazon EC2/S3 or other cloud service providers* Building systems deployment and service management automation tools* Familiarity with large scale systems and methodologiesIf this sounds interesting then we want to hear from you!

      Vancouver, BC, Canada. full post: https://www.matygo.com/careersMatygo takes the traditional university classroom and explodes it across time, space, and social dimensions. We've reexamined the problems historically addressed by an LMS[1] and built a globally accessible free system for university instructors that makes learning more efficient, removes redundancies in teaching, builds social and content graphs, and has already gained traction internationally.We're a small founding team (two, both technical, plus an HN-hired intern) with a huge ambition to revolutionize one of the largest and most important industries on earth. We are seeking a developer and a marketing communicator. These will be our key first hires and will be expected to lead teams in the near future.By far, the most important qualification is culture fit.See the story of William Kamkwanba from one of our first blog posts (http://blog.matygo.com/post/518849458/announcing-the-matygo-...) for our guiding philosophy.Matygo is a GrowLab company (http://www.growlab.ca/), backed by top investors. We are still in the first quarter of the program - joining now means being able to go through most of the program including the trip to SF, Demo Day, Under the Radar conf, and meeting a ton of people.Developer:- We play with fun tech: our backend is a custom framework in Scala and our web frontend is Sproutcore. We need someone who can rock them both: Javascript experience is essential, and Scala would be fantastic (but Java + some functional is sufficient).- Very comfortable with all levels of the web stack. Can implement a feature front-to-back from our db (schema design, mysql) to the css and js that makes our app hum. Rest, http, and tcp understanding essential.- Good software engineering skills including testing (e.g. unit vs. integration - when to use which?), system design, and agile techniques.Marketer:- Great communication skills: Will be responsible for everything from our A/B testing our landing page and social media to partner and customer engagement channels.- Familiarity with lean startup and customer development approaches.- Possess the ability, drive, and vision required to play a key part in developing and executing Matygo's user acquisition strategy. We go direct to instructors (and students, in the near future).- Sales and presentation/public speaking experience would be fantastic.For both positions:- Creative. Bonus points for side hobbies like music, photography, design, or any other creative expression.- Desire to work startup hours and understand the commitment, responsibility, and rewards that come with being a first employee of a high growth startup.- See 'how to apply': https://www.matygo.com/careers[1]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system
                      
                  
      INTERN - looking for a PR/Marketing intern at http://feefighters.comWe're in Chicago, you don't have to be, though it would be preferred. We've had great luck hiring programming interns from HN and have already hired a social media/marketing intern. We could use a Public Relations intern too.Here's the job description for the marketing intern that we already filled... We haven't written a PR intern description yet but it would be similar, but with more Public Relationsy stuff.
http://feefighters.com/jobs/kickass-marketing-intern/Press is a big part of what we do, for driving traffic to the site and SEO purposes. We have been able to get great press on our own (http://feefighters.com/press) and fired 2 different PR firms we were working with. Another aspect of PR is figuring out where we should be on the internet - responding in forums etc. Drop me a line if you're interested- email is in my profile.
