      I feel like every time I see an Oculus post in these threads I get really excited for mobile work then see that you're still only hiring for Android. Any reason no iOS love?
                      
                  
      With AOSP, you can build a custom Android device.  It's unlikely you can get a license from Apple to build a custom iOS device.
                      
                  
      Surely they'll want iOS games and compatibility at launch right? They could take the whole market of iOS/VR from launch day if they plan it right. Am I taking crazy pills, or does that not seem like a HUGE opportunity?
                      
                  
      I'm just waiting for the day the public actually uses the Rift for fully supported games. Hopefully when that comes Microsoft (and/or Sony) will have jumped on the bandwagon and implemented support for the rift too.
                      
                  
      Well that has to be a first!

      Is this onsite only or remote/telecommute for the right candidate?
                      
                  
      As a rule, candidates will only be considered if they can relocate. Relocation expenses are covered, though.(And yes, we know getting people to move to LA is a handicap for us...)
                      
                  
      I'd LOVE to move to LA! Right now I'm studying computer engineering at UC Davis with an embedded systems project (freescale cup) involved and some iOS app development on the side.The tough part for me is I keep hesitating to apply to you guys because my projects are getting more interesting as time goes on (and I have more time to put into them, EE classes suck up a lot of time!)Ah well, anyway, I will be applying for a few positions, including that one mentioned. Perhaps you'll get to interview me, that'd be awesome :)

      In other words, no.

      Meta: I wish this bot would submit threads on the first Tuesday after the first of each month, so employers who work M-F would be more likely to see and post.  Tuesday around 10a to noon Pacific time seems to have the best chance of covering the majority of HN audience.
                      
                  
      Perhaps employers should be smart enough to write their bots too?

We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support.

Two months ago, we launched here on Hacker News [ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6858373 ]. Here's what some of you guys said:- "Wow. I rarely download this stuff. But the fact that it claims to be automatic piqued my interest. After downloading it I can say that my first impression is shocked. Shocked that I really liked it."- "This is very well done. This could crush Facebook. Not in the short term but if you create a timeline that is more personally valuable to people they will be far more likely to use it and share it with friends and family. Your timeline is already far more interesting then my "Wall."- "Why is it free? I would've paid for this."- "I have been looking for this. I've been so desperate for this I've been contemplating creating it myself."We're looking for mobile engineers (iOS - hard problems include making our sync engine fast/reliable, fast/intuitive search for memories, surfacing important memories in the background, UI performance, and doing it all without using a lot of battery), systems engineers (Python, Devops, Puppet/Chef - hard problems include delivering accurate geocoding for memories, reliable syncing, and building systems to monitor and scale all of it automatically), and data scientists (R/Matlab/SPSS, Python, SQL, statistics, machine learning - hard problems include using ML to improve accuracy of geocoding, building growth and retention models, all while guaranteeing user anonymity and privacy).We will fly you out for interviews and relocate you to San Francisco if you aren't here already. A lot of our team work remotely from time to time, but we haven't found full time remote employees to work out well for us since we collaborate so closely together in real time.Please email me directly at siqi at hey dot co (8 hour SLA for a response). I'm also happy to answer questions here.Fun fact: 33% of our engineering team found us through Whoâ€™s Hiring threads here.

You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.If you join, you'd become part of a team that is building one of the web's greatest analytics companies, while also serving a strong mission: helping editors and writers at top news organizations excel in the digital medium.Our software aggregates data on >5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.Apply by sending a (short!) cover letter to work@parsely.com.

      Academia.edu, San Francisco, CAAcademia.edu is trying to improve the way that scientific publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world." Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

      Eponym (New York, NY, USA)
http://www.eponymous.coWe're an eyewear company looking for engineers to help architect and build our software which powers eyeglass orders for fashion brands.Our team is looking for someone to take the lead iterating on user experience features. What kinds of things should we A/B test? Should we implement an email capture? How can we update the checkout flow? Where are customers having difficulty when buying prescription eyewear on our websites? You would help decide what kinds of features to build, and then be responsible for implementing, testing, and iterating on new features. You should be proficient in HTML/CSS/JS (framework-du-jour) and interested in using these skills to help our customers have a great experience.This also applies to internal dashboards: we ship everything from our office, and have a lot of infrastructure to keep track of customers, order status, laboratory status, and shipments. How can we build more usable tools?Our backend is Python (Flask) and MongoDB, including bits of Celery, nginx, and uwsgi. We do a lot of integration with the UPS (in fact, we maintain an open-source UPS library [1]). If you are interested in helping develop our eyewear API, please reach out too!We develop white-label eyewear for other fashion brands; Classic Specs and Steven Alan are some of our brands. Email me! jay@classicspecs.com[1] https://github.com/classicspecs/ClassicUPS. If you build something cool that others would find useful, we want you to open-source it.

      San Francisco, CA - Zenbox. Software Engineer. [LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]We're a YC company wrangling SaaS to work together (as they should), starting by bringing the biggest apps our customers use right into Gmail. We've been growing our team over the past few months, and looking to add even more awesome people. We work with dozens of API's to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw available when helping customers.Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there's still so much polish and improvement possible.We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we've recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it's interesting.
Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers.Interested in working with Reactjs, Om, and functional programming in the client? We're building a team that's able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.This is both UI and backend work.Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript. sean @ zenboxapp https://www.zenboxapp.com

      Folsom Labs, San Francisco, Full Time (www.folsomlabs.com)Basically, if you are interested in science and/or energy, and want to do software engineering at a place that actually let's you leverage the math/physics you learned in college/grad school, we're probably as good a fit as you'll find.  We make powerful design tools for Solar PV systems, making them very easy to use by leveraging a pretty sophisticated simulation engine (so we handle the physics for the user).We've already launched our product[1], have some great traction (including a federal grant), and we're still just a 2 man team, so there's a lot of opportunity.  Everyday we get to deal with a range of problems that few startups get to offer â€“ we have a pretty modern web-stack [2] (that we actually need, not just to be trendy), but also get to solve interesting physics/optimization problems on a regular basis. It's a really unique place in both the solar industry, and as a software company.â€“ Paul

      Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility for the right candidate)---At Khan Academy, we're a small, 52-person non-profit tech startup. We're trying hard to do good for the world. Here's a testimonial we received just two days ago:January 29, 2014I am an adult returning to school for a midlife career change. I have always disliked math and thought I was bad at it -- and my last math class was over 20 years ago! But I just passed my Accuplacer placement test, thanks to Khan Academy. Thank you so much for making it fun and easy to refresh my skills. I also purchased the Accuplacer test prep app, but I found myself coming back to Khan Academy more often because I liked it more. Now I am learning coding at school, so I'll definitely be back for more!LisaThis letter is one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives like this that we've transformed.--Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site. That's a lot.With this huge scale, we're able to study learning in a way that wasn't previously possible. We've run tests and found that students learn more when they're given harder problems based on an intelligent machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how different spaced repetition algorithms affect retention. We're also beginning to release anonymized student data to external researchers.We're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs so far. We're totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now, you can be a main developer on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. This is a rare opportunity.You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business Ã¢â‚¬â€œ though we have "celebrity" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are also amazing.Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring our interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we're a non-profit, we pay well too. I'm also proud to say that we're winning against GitHub in team Bensity (i.e., percentage of employees named Ben) [6].---We're hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), designers, and more -- if you're a designer, you might also be interested in our parnership with Bridge [7]. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us. Let me know if you know someone great.Please apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers directly (say you saw us on HN!).

We use karel to teach that computer science is about problem solving. We start in JavaScript, but use a thin teaching library because we believe in teaching concepts over syntax.Try it out and let us know what you think at codehs.com.Our site is built in python, django, JavaScript, and we're on ec2.CodeHS was recently a winner at NBC's Education Nation and has been featured on the Today Show and a number of other places.Thanks!

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am curently the only employee) and aim to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.

      Notting Hill, London, England, U.K.Our web application is at the heart of our busy and successful e-commerce business; every day it serves millions of product images and handles hundreds of thousands of user visits, but we can and do update the live site with new code anytime we want - multiple times per day - without missing a beat. Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services; we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles, especially developers of all levels of experience.Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is the UK's leading private shopping club, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many of them familiar from the high street. The company has about eighty employees and a substantial annual turnover; it was recently selected to join the UK's Future Fifty programme for the country's most rapidly growing startups.

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan  (INTERN yes, REMOTE/H1B no)http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, email me and I'll get you more info on how to apply:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

Time, Wall Street Journal, Mashable, Xconomy, and a slew of tech bloggers raved about it. Check it out. http://craigslist.mokriya.com/We are a team of engineers, UX designers, and thinkers. We have worked for some of the hottest tech startups in Silicon Valley, including Path, MixPanel, Threadflip, SimpleGeo, SideCar, etc.Google has us on a list of â€œbest mobile development teams in the countryâ€� so we get calls from them too.About YouYou love to build. When youâ€™re not at your job, youâ€™re probably tinkering on some contraption in the basement or figuring out how to take apart <insert-something-you-bought-recently>. You get a thrill from figuring out a clever way to solve a problem. And you really take pride in knowing the ins and outs of Android. You should be familiar with the libraries so that you know the best ways to do things without re-inventing the wheel.About How We WorkEvery developer on the team is remote, so we just get stuff done, from wherever, and chat via HipChat/GitHub to communicate. That, and the occasional G+ Hangout, is all weâ€™ve found to be necessary.Send a note to careers@mokriya.com (I'll see it, I'm Adam. Sunil & Pranil, the technical co-founders, will see it also). Say hi, tell us a bit about yourself. We'll be most excited if you tell us about recent projects you've built, and technical details that you learned, or that interested you.
