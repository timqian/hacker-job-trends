FULL TIME
San Francisco, CAHey HN!I'm Jesse, one of the co-founders of Everlane, and we're hiring engineers.Check out our website at http://www.everlane.com, and my personal blog at http://20bits.comWe're trying to re-imagine retail online and make it easy to find products that match your taste and style. Right now we're focused on mens fashion, but our ambitions are much larger.pg did a good job of explaining the opportunity, here: http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.htmlHere's a sample of some of the user feedback we get daily:* I can't wait until you open a store.* When are you going to start selling things?  I want to spend all my money with you.* It's like you entered my brain and turned it into a store.* I want to buy all my husband's clothes from you -- please start selling!We're well-funded by really awesome investors and need engineers who are interested in building the next big online retail destination.Our current stack is Ruby, Rails, MySQL, and Heroku, but smart and hungry beats knowledge of specific languages.If you're interested send me an email at jesse@everlane.com and mention this post.  The most important thing is for you to be excited by the opportunity, so make it clear.Bonus points for including a solution to this exercise in the language of your choice: http://static.everlane.com/everlane_exercise.pdf

      Newton, MA - Full Time (also remote, see below)Sonian provides a large-scale email archiving platform resold by several vendors you may have heard of. We run entirely on EC2, and Amazon was an investor in our Series B ($9M). We use Clojure for our backend, Rails for the frontend, and Chef to manage infrastructure (i work in the latter group). We are expanding, but the devs all know each other and we work in cross-functional teams whenever possible.The development teams are mostly remote and use tmux/Skype to pair program. Our VP of E is looking for a Director of Development, however, and for this someone local is preferable. We're looking for someone with experience not just building reliable applications at scale but managing remote teams to do so. We have a longer formal posting ready, but it's not up yet so email me (decklin@red-bean.com) for more info.Also, if you're a Chef expert or just an ops-and-dynamic-languages hacker who loves to learn new things, but not interested in management, please contact me too! Any location. I'd love to make the case for another devop on my team. A full posting for that is up at http://www.sonian.com/about/careers/development-operations-e....Perks: get flown out to Boston twice a year (or if like me you're already here, Sushi Thursdays :-)), MacBook Pro or ThinkPad, good benefits.For both positions, please contact jobs@sonian.net and let them know that I (Decklin Foster) referred you. Thanks!
                      
                  
      Dropbox has many full-time engineering, design, and support positions open in SF http://dropbox.com/jobsI help manage user growth there so I can tell you with pretty strong certainty there is no better opportunity. Dropbox has very few people but is running at a huge scale already.
                      
                  
      I don't know why JobVite doesn't offer a RSS feed of job openings, but in case anyone is interested we (LinkUp) offer a RSS feed that shows all of Dropbox's jobs - http://bit.ly/dropboxrss.A very good indicator of how cool the coders at Dropbox are is the challenges page that they use for hiring engineers: http://www.dropbox.com/jobs/challenges. That awesomeness is why everyone should keep their RSS feed handy!
                      
                  
      I wish that Dropbox would allow remote work.And I say this because I love the product. I'm just not at all interested in living in California.
                      
                  
      managing remote folks is hard so we're not really focused on that right now.
                      
                  
      I might be missing something, but I don't see any design position open, mainly engineering.
                      
                  
      we just haven't posted to jobviteemail me if you're interested: ivan@dropbox.com

      Austin, TX - Full-time positions for Java developers, a senior web architect/technical lead, PHP (Drupal) developers, HTML/CSS/JS front-end developers, artists and UX/interaction designers.We're BioWare, a video game company, and we're making a Star Wars massively-multiplayer online video game called Star Wars: The Old Republic.The Java positions are in our customer service and our middleware team: the live video game relays every movement and interaction of every player in real-time to a Java middleware on Oracle that feeds data into our customer service systems, our data warehouse, and our web site.The senior web architect/technical lead would design and run the technical implementations of the web side of things.The PHP (Drupal) positions are doing the back-end integration with that middleware and presenting live game data to the web.The HTML/CSS/JS positions are the front-end development of our web apps and site.Plus artists and another UX to design and draw it all.Contact me if you're interested, or http://www.bioware.com/careers/austin
                      
                  
      The Java Developer description explains that you are looking for a Senior Java/J2EE programmer with a minimum of 10 years of experience. Are opportunities available for good Java developers with fewer years of experience, but who are quick learners and have worked with some of the technology listed?
                      
                  
      Last I heard, we had multiple openings.  They try to roll them up into single postings, perhaps this is the "most important" one they're looking for.Feel free to send me your details and I'll ask on Monday.
                      
                  
      I am not currently looking for work, but I love BioWare and was curious which positions were available. The question about experience popped into my head as I was reading over the job description and I thought that other people who are looking to apply may have been wondering the same thing. Thanks for the prompt reply!
                      
                  
      Are these positions for local candidates only?  Im a Front End Developer but not in Austin (at the moment).
                      
                  
      Well, you'd have to move here, but a relocation budget would be provided.
                      
                  
      I completely respect your company's requirement for locals, but I am genuinely curious as to why companies continue to insist on local presence for most all positions.  I can guess at what the perceived benefits would be, but would really like to hear from an actual hiring manager what their actual reasons are.  Are the reasons more about control, or economics?
                      
                  
      I think you underestimate the cultural requirement for remote work, which any company not founded by UNIX geeks who grew up on IRC won't have.  We're not that company.  We've been around for fifteen years, and the doctors, writers, artists and designers who don't like working that way substantially outnumber the Windows desktop-centric and video game console developers, few of whom are likely comfortable with a terminal window.BioWare has people in all five studios working on the game, so we have some experience with working remotely, but that includes things like videoconferencing equipment in every meeting room and video chat cameras and headsets on most PCs.Successfully supporting remote workers is difficult and most companies are not equipped for the cultural shift that optimal remote work requires.In addition, the web team works across almost every part of the organization, and that includes senior management who don't sit in front of a PC all day, so you have to chase them down in person to find out an answer to something.From an implementation standpoint, all of the work we're doing expects fast, localhost or local network access to everything from video game servers to Oracle databases.  It's pretty slow to work from home over VPN, and if you're remote, things like network route problems have prevented people from working for days at a time.Finally, it's BioWare, and it's Star Wars.  The company is used to people liking the game industry and this company enough to move here from all over the world, sometimes on their own dime, for the privilege of being part of one of the few universally well-respected game companies and work the only property with a realistic chance of being the next big MMO.
                      
                  
      Are the positions only available for US citizens/residents?  I'm basically what you're after (senior java dev with 10+ years experience), but I'm British.
                      
                  
      We do occasionally procure visas.  Apply and find out?  :)
                      
                  
      Really REMOTE.deviantART (http://www.deviantart.com) wants developers. We're fully remote; there's no central office with a team located there. We expect all hires to be comfortable working in PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL; we like our developers to be able to hack on any part of the site, rather than being frontend/backend specialists.One exception to all that: there's an Infrastructure Engineer position which is located in Vancouver. It's C++/Java focused, and involves developing backend services used by the rest of the site.We post information about our development process here sometimes: http://dt.deviantart.com/blog/Apply here: http://deviantart.theresumator.com/apply

      New York City -- UI Architect -- SeatGeekWe're a data-driven search engine for sports and concert tickets.  We're trying to use analytics and exceptional UX to make buying event tickets a wholly better experience.We currently have a four-person dev team, but everyone prefers to work on the backend.  We're looking for someone to come in and own the frontend of the web app, which will involve creating interfaces in Photoshop, brining them to life in HTML/CSS, and (ideally, but not necessarily) doing some Javascript work.More details here: http://seatgeek.com/jobs/frontend/
                      
                  
      These guys are world-class!  They also work out of General Assembly, which is quickly becoming the hub of tech startups in the city.
                      
                  
      I'm interested in why would using OS X be a requirement?
                      
                  
      Certainly a fair question.  We use it as a signal.  Of the 100+ UI folks I admire and respect, I think all of them use OS X.  So while it's certainly possible to be a great interface developer using a different platform, in my experience such people are exceedingly rare.By focusing on those that use OS X we can narrow down the applicant pool and spend more time with folks that are likely to be a good fit.
                      
                  
      Seattle, WA - SEOmoz is hiring primarily local positions, but may have some flexibility on remote, particularly for engineers.Here are our 8 open positions currently - http://www.seomoz.org/blog/8-open-positions-at-seomoz and please note that for software engineers, we pay a $12,000 referral bonus to anyone who refers an engineer we hire as well as $12,000 as a signing bonus to the engineer. Details here - http://www.seomoz.org/refer-an-engineer
                      
                  
      $12k referral bonus seems a bit rich. Is that the norm for Seattle?I'm seeing around $5-10k referral bonus at other Bay Area startups. Talent is also insanely constrained around here.
                      
                  
      It's not the norm, but it has helped us a bit, and to be honest, it's still less expensive than most recruiters. When you're hiring positions between $90-$150K, recruiters want 20-30% of that first year's salary, so spending $24K to build a more organic pipeline makes a lot of sense.
                      
                  
      I'm not sure if it's the norm but I know SEOmoz are desperate for top talent and are willing to pay for it. Their web-index is pretty complex and so the engineers they hire need to be highly skilled.
                      
                  
      Do you only hire Americans or would a Canadian engineer work too?

      Yammer is hiring in San Francisco. We're one block away from the Caltrain station.What do we do? Yammer helps turn the mayhem of the corporate world into return-on-investment unicorns and leveraged-employee-engagement butterflies.We are a medium sized start-up that is battling several big enterprise software companies in this space. So yes, our target customers are in the enterprise space but we are turning this space upside down with our viral approach and how we build solutions for the user (which doesnâ€™t include an army of salesmen). We are solving consumer type problems but also monetize like enterprise software. (i.e. real revenues with fewer users)What's in it for you?
 - Amazing group of smart engineers to work with. (Sounds cliche, but we really do have smart people here :D)
 - Ability to have influence without authority. Yammer is a product-focused and user-focused organization. Everything we do revolves around that.
 - We hack in Ruby/Rails, Scala/Java, Javascript/JQuery/Node.js/Adobe AIR, Obj-C for iOS, and some MSFT stuff for Sharepoint I don't know too much about. You'll probably find something you want to work on.
 - Good catered lunch and dinner daily, with a 3PM snack cart. (Really.)
 - Fancy Apple hardware of your choice (you can have a PC if you really want one.)
 - Our engineers can outdrink anyone.
 - Top of the market compensation.
 - Seriously, we rock.For more information check out: https://www.yammer.com/about/jobs or contact me: bkudria@yammer-inc.com(Note: we also offer real referral fees. Sell your friends today!)

      Ashburn, VA - Brain wiring diagram extractionI'm hiring a software developer for my group at Janelia Farm Research Campus, in Ashburn, VA. The goal will be to develop workflow for extracting wiring diagrams of neuronal circuits from large-scale serial electron microscopy of brain tissue (10 TB+ image volumes). You can read about what I'm doing at http://www.hhmi.org/research/fellows/bock.html, and browse data at http://bit.ly/ga3Cfk. A detailed writeup of the approach was published last month in an article at Nature.I think the ideal candidate could come from a variety of backgrounds -- someone who had previously written or contributed significantly to the development of a game engine could be good, for example.

      San Francisco, CAAffine Systems generates data about online video using computer vision (face recognition, product recognition, scene classification, etc.) for advertisers to use in targeting and filtering their online video campaigns.We did over a million dollars in revenue last year working on campaigns for major brands. We recently raised our B round, led by Crosslink Capital, the investors behind Pandora.We are looking for test-driven engineers (and sysadmins) to work on an internet-scale video processing pipeline using Python, MySQL, Selenium, ffmpeg and other open source tools. Its goal is to find and ingest videos from web pages and to generate and store metadata about those videos using our vision algorithms written in C++.You aren't expected to have a background in computer vision, but it would be great if you are interested in learning more about it. We are building a cross-functional team, so you will work closely with our computer vision experts to plan new capabilities and bring them into production.We are also looking for computer vision experts who feel the need as we do to build an engine that can watch and understand all of the world's video. This is truly the greatest AI problem as there is no more quintessentially human activity than watching TV.No remote hires, please. You must be willing to work at our office five days a week in a pair programming environment.

      Palo Alto, CA - Stanford University - Full Stack Software EngineerApply: http://bit.ly/hve1ATWe're looking for a junior/mid level software engineer with an ability to work on front and back end code. We have a Rails/Javascript UI that uses a RESTful service built with Java (Spring, Hibernate, RESTlet) as its datastore.Our team runs as closely to a startup as you can in the academic environment. We're responsible for building BioPortal: http://bioportal.bioontology.org. This isn't one of those research projects that produces a ton of theory but nothing usable. We're responsible for a full production environment that gets tens of millions of hits a month and have a full team of developers, including proper managers and even some QA (this is huge in academia). The project is well-funded by the NIH and we're halfway through year one of a five year grant.You'll have a huge say in how things get implemented. We're not scared to incorporate new tech and definitely appreciate what people have to bring to the table. You'll be encouraged to get things done with minimal supervision, but everyone on the team is excited about talking through problems as needed.Stanford Pros:* Competitive compensation. Stanford likes to hire the best and we know we're competing with Google, Facebook, and everyone else. Salaries are competitive, obviously no access to options, bonuses, or profit-sharing :)* Awesome benefits. This makes up for the lack of compensation to me.

      Seattle, WA - Software Development EngineerAWS - My team is looking for software engineers passionate about building new web services.  If youâ€™re interested in building high performance distributed systems, come join a new AWS service and influence the direction of the leading cloud provider.  We have several positions for a range of experience levels.  If youâ€™re not in Seattle but are up for a change of scenery, Amazon has a great relocation program that makes it extremely easy to join AWS.https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/133388/job

https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137677/jobAWS is an unique mix of startup culture/autonomy combined with the ability to leverage the incredible infrastructure of Amazon/AWS.  Iâ€™ve worked in AWS for the past year and Iâ€™ve learned more in that time than I thought possible.  Iâ€™m an infrastructure person at heart, and at other companies Iâ€™ve worked for, Iâ€™m always torn between doing the deep engineering that I love, or working on a more customer focused product.  In AWS, they are one and the same.  I like having scalability, availability, and performance as core features of the product Iâ€™m building.  Another thing I love about working in AWS is the impact your work has - your service is used by thousands of developers, and those developers use your service in ways you never imagined, which are then used by millions of people.
                      
                  
      Seattle (or San Francisco) - Designers and developersPicture of Health makes tools that help people take care of people. We are self-funded, pre-launch, and small (4 in Seattle, 2 in SF). This is an opportunity to be in the first wave and help define how we do things.What we most need right now is one or two great designers to own branding, interaction, and visual design for our web and device products. We're building consumer services, and having the right design will be important. We're committed to making sure designers are full partners in the development process. (See http://vurl.me/AYRJ)The current dev team is me plus three former Hashrocketeers in downtown Seattle. That's a great start, but we'd still love to hear from developers as well. (See http://vurl.me/AZHL)We'd prefer to keep the dev/design team in Seattle for now, but we could bend this rule for an exceptional person who wants to be in SF.BTW, my co-founder used to be CEO of Sun, so we have a lot of runway. Also, in addition to the usual startup chaos, we have a few big-company perks like salaries and health insurance. :)Contact me at walter@pictureofhealth.com, or http://www.pictureofhealth.com/jobs.

I'd prefer those who have a possibility of coming on long-term as I build out the team, most likely around Palo Alto, but do have immediate needs that lead me to consider splitting up short-term chunks of development for freelancers. In any case, we're distributed for now so remote is the only possibility.backend: postgres, python, django, gevent + gunicornfrontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, modernizr, compassI'm looking for:1. Advanced web jacks-of-many-trades. You know a lot about several things from above and have at least tried your hand at a demo app using the rest. Backend/frontend/deployment.2. A specialized front-end dev who knows their javascript in-and-out. We're designing a single page architecture for the most part. Mobile browser experience would be good.3.

      Austin, TXThe Texas Tribune is looking for experienced developers to help us improve and open source our Knight Foundation-funded, Django-based news CMS (http://armstrongcms.org/), and build interactive "news apps" that make it easier to understand what's going on in the Texas government. (If you're looking for an internship, we can probably create a paid position for you.) Few people know what's going on in their state governments, even though that's where a lot of the things that affect people's day-to-day lives get decided.

We're a small team that decides its own destiny technology-wise. We work on a single product that's continuously developed, with lots of functional variety (there's plenty of non-CRUD work). Also, there's lots of opportunity for a developer to influence what they end up building.http://www.mcs.be/index.php?id=web-app-analyst-developerWe also have an opening for a Delphi developer, if we can find such a rare breed.

      Unpaid internships are illegal in Canada, by the way, so you'd have to be hiring/getting help from someone out of the country.
                      
                  
      Do you have any references to back this up? I would be interested in seeing them. Our lawyer (a well known technology partner at a large Vancouver firm: http://www.cwilson.com/people/10-profiles/69-brock-smith/pro...) had no qualms with this type of offer. Bit of an aside: in my experience unpaid internships can work out quite well for everyone involved, provided everyone is very unfront and transparent about expectations/abilities/mentoring to be provided.edit: added link to Brock. He is awesome BTW, highly recommended.
                      
                  
      I seem to be mistaken. Unpaid internships are illegal in most provinces in Candada, I suppose not BC though.http://blogs.hrhero.com/northernexposure/2009/06/15/beware-t...http://www.yorku.ca/ddoorey/lawblog/?p=2169
                      
                  
      I don't think even in other provinces, the first one warns you about the difference between an employee and an intern and the second one says about the same thing an even mentions he did no legal research on this.You have to just be careful while your doing it same as when you hire someone as a contracter making sure you don't treat them like an employee.
                      
                  
      Unpaid internships can work out quite well for everyone involved, but not everyone can afford to work for no pay.
