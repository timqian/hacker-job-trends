      Anonymous review:I tried this process because it sounded pretty fun and unique.One warning I have for anyone interested is that there are some big waiting times involved.  I'll share my timeline.  Some of the lags were on my end, but I was assured I had as much time as I needed.  - Day 0-6 - First contact
  - Day 7 - Assigned work sample
  - Day 21 - Submitted work sample
  - Day 62 - Work sample results returned
  - Day 72 - Paid work day
  - Day 79 - Work day report completed
  - Day 85 - Final decision

Overall there were 21 days where they were waiting on me and 47 days where I was waiting on them.  This seemed to me like a lot of waiting but maybe it is normal.I probably worked 15 hours on the work sample, 8 hours on the work day, and 8 more hours putting together the report after the work day.
                      
                  
      Oof, bummer. Your experience is slower than average. We ran into a grading crunch when we launched our Enterprise product. When you submit your work to us, your submission is anonymous. Three engineers grade each submission.Platform Engineers will experience the greatest wait periods. The other roles tend to be quicker.Expected time-frame:* Proceed from application to work sample: 24 hours.* Complete work sample: Up to the candidate. We build them to take 2-6 hours.* Grade work sample: 1-4 weeks.* Schedule work day: 1 week.* Receive decision: 2-5 days.Thanks for taking our time to try the process out, it is appreciated. The method is constantly under improvement.
                      
                  
      It's hard to see how you can have much success with this method. Current recruiting strategies involve getting from recruiter telephone call to final decision within 2 weeks, or 1 if possible. The faster you move on a candidate the more likely they end up working for you. At my current employer initial phone conversation, telephone interview and on site were all within 7 days.
                      
                  
      While I'd never argue its a "good" thing to have a slower pipeline, in the past when I had pipelines with timing similar to this companies, it didn't have extreme negative impacts on the success of the pipeline.I don't know why that was, but my suspicion was that our highest qualified leads were those coming from candidates that were "happy enough" at their current positions to not be frantically searching.As long as we seemed like a good place to work, and we did a good job of communicating why back logs were happening, we didn't lose many of the candidates we were most excited about.
                      
                  
      my experience is that I am mostly happy where I am, and I am not in market when I am Happy, but when I am not happy, I want to get out asap and wait times as high as a month is a real turn off
                      
                  
      It seems you truly care about feedback and the quality of your process. FWIW: I'm glad you are making these timelines transparent so people can decide whether the position is a good fit or not for them. As someone who is in the field for over a decade, it strikes me that this timeline is really long and you run the risk of getting people who couldn't get a better offer from another top employer faster. In addition, I personally have stopped engaging any hiring process that has a take home exam. My view is that my degrees and track record are sufficient evidence of my competence. Also, my time is really valuable .. so engaging with companies who are forced to waste their engineer's time as well as mine seems fair. Just one person's opinion :)
                      
                  
      I understand why you do but I don't really care how long it takes -- because I don't need a new job.The one I have is just fine.But I'll probably take a shot at this one because that "blind" process won't care how many trips around the sun I've made.
                      
                  
      * Grade work sample: 1-4 weeks.That's heinous.
                      
                  
      Agreed. That's kind of ridiculous. I don't understand this whole "we are not interested in speaking with you as a real human being but 'here', here is some homework for you to do' Seems really silly.
                      
                  
      It has its tradeoffs.  The point is, if they're going to go that route the assignment should be short and sweet, and the response should be quick.  Especially since we can pretty much tell, like, right away whether we like someone else's code or not, now can't we?Basic, common-sense considerations which a lot of places don't seem to appreciate, unfortunately.And to not respond at all is just a gratuitous insult.
                      
                  
      He's understating what he's done a bit. We're vastly more consistent with candidate feedback than we used to be, largely due to tooling + process changes that grayfox has put in place. It's improving, we'd like to turn evals around in <1 week for everyone.
                      
                  
      Of course they're a 'corp', and of course they're looking after their own interests over yours. Looking after your interests is your own job, no one else's.The employer-employee relationship is partly a fight. The best you can hope is that it be a gentleman's one, with no hits under the belt, rather than an all-out brawl or backstabbing.grayfox is showing you cards that the average employer would hold back and would only release at gunpoint: salary range, internal details of hiring process, how long the process takes... seems this is gentleman's territory for now.The long process selects for people who are happy with their jobs, which is the situation of most experienced and skilled people. I have seen worse.Edit: I'm realising this is more aggresive than I like. I'll leave it as is, with the addition that I once thought like you, and this here is the state of mind I've come to have now that I've been on both sides of the recruiting fence.
                      
                  
      That's a fair reply - thanks.I still don't personally like it, but I'd say my bias is mostly that I am older and have kids...I've been fucked over by so many companies in my 20+ years in Silicon Valley that I do not trust any HR team or "vision of a unicorn family"...But I will say that this model would look ideal to any millennial person who wants to work at a "progressive" tech company/start-upBut said company shall become as ruthless as any as they mature.Work is not your family. Either knock it out of the park, or get fucked. Success in our industry is binary.
                      
                  
      I sympathize with you and also dislike long evaluation times. I also have kids and a life outside of work. Personally I think 6 hours is too long to design a work sample around but it's not that bad, I've done work samples (early in my career) that took 3 days and that I would've billed out for $3k when I became a consultant later.In grayfox's timeline, things really seem to hang up around the time it takes to evaluate the sample, asking for 1-4 weeks. This is another point in favor of minimalist work samples (smaller sample = less time required to review). IMO work samples should be a simple problem where the candidate demonstrates his basic awareness of the core skills needed to perform the daily work and the bulk of the hiring process should occur in a discussion between parties.Anyway, I'd suggest that they tighten up this process by a) minimizing their work samples and b) making it priority to review work samples as they come in, which means adding more resources for this purpose if necessary. It shouldn't take more than a week to hear back at any step of the process.
                      
                  
      Minimalist work sample tests don't work.  The work sample test is the test.  There is no other criteria involved in whether to hire someone other than their performance on the work sample test.  Otherwise it's not a work sample test; it's an intro.This is a step forward for our industry.  For those who don't like it, there are plenty of jobs where you can do the traditional whiteboard hazing.
                      
                  
      >Minimalist work sample tests do not work.I've had a lot of success hiring with minimalist work samples.>Otherwise it's not a work sample test; it's an intro.Well, like I said, I think the work sample should only be needed to show basic awareness and that the rest of the process should be based upon the course of a discussion around the candidate's relevant experience, the company's needs and intended role for the candidate, etc., so perhaps it's not wrong to call the code sample an "intro". I referred to it as a "litmus test", meaning it's a simple pass/fail; they are either able to throw something together in 1-2 hours showing that they have basic awareness and competence dealing with the problem space, or they're not.Overall fit is much more important than something like "candidate Y has better indentation habits". Human cycles are thousands of times more valuable than CPU cycles. It's better to choose the good fit candidate whose coding habits can be trained up over the course of his employment than the unstable abrasive candidate whose code ran 1.5x faster than anyone else's.>whiteboard hazingHeh, I don't suggest this either.The frightening reality about hiring is that it can't really be reduced down to a formula. There are subjective judgments that have to be made (in both directions, meaning that you shouldn't be absolutist about things that are correctable in their code sample) if you're going to get good hires and a cohesive team. Questions like "Is this person an active, curious learner?", "Is this person able to field fair critiques of his work product professionally, reasonably, and humbly?", and "Is this person's personality going to mesh OK with the rest of the team within a professional work-day setting?" are all much more important than a raw benchmark of their code sample.I know that a lot of people don't like that subjectivity, especially when they're on the wrong end of a subjective judgment, but I don't think it's a good idea to discard evaluation on those metrics. We just have to hope hiring managers are using reasonable subjective criteria, and if they're not at the company we want to work for, we gotta move on. Fortunately for us, there are plenty of fish in the sea looking to employ programmers right now.
                      
                  
      Our sample projects are meant to tell us that a person is technically capable of doing the individual work for a given job. The work day that comes after answers "can they work well with us?"The criteria for both project/workday is predefined ahead of time, and the part we spend the most time on. Sample projects have ~40 criteria, nothing quite so minute as "indentation habits" but we do give points for "idiomatic use of golang" on the go work.What we found when we were putting processes in place is that we just shifted our bias. As an exampe: if a recruiting process judges abrasiveness during a traditional set of interviews, it's probably biased. It's better to put people into a work scenario and judge their actual work and how they interact with other people.
                      
                  
      Can you define "minimalist"? Or what you would consider minimalist.
                      
                  
      A self-contained project that gives the candidate room to demonstrate a basic grasp on core skills. It should take no more than an hour or 2 hours at most if the candidate chooses to stay within the constraints of the project (in my experience, candidates will often throw in a few extra features since we're not monopolizing their time with a demanding list of requirements, which provides really awesome insight into the candidate). In most cases, if the candidate is capable of a simple project like that, they'd be equally capable of a larger project, and there's no use wasting anyone's time on a larger thing (unless you're focusing on the wrong stuff, like specific knowledge of one particular library).For my purposes, I like variations on a project that asks them to implement a very basic listing call from a public API. I let them use any language they want. This shows that they can put together a project in some language, look up API and/or library documentation, provision an API key, reference external API docs and code a function that reads against it. I understand that Compose covers a different space and would need to tailor a different minimalist project.For me, if they're capable of this minimalist code task, it demonstrates basic competency and filters out almost all of the guys that aren't worth wasting time on. It doesn't demand too much of their time and allows them maximum freedom, which allows us to see a lot of information not only about their organizational skills but also about their code ideals. It doesn't penalize a great asset for not having run across a specific language, platform, library, algorithm, or data structure in his/her past; those things can be learned quickly by good candidates. It doesn't depend on knowledge of trivia or number of times they've seen the problem in past interviews/tests. It's not overly academic and doesn't depend on how long it's been since they reviewed their compsci textbook.The rest of the information needed to make a hiring decision is derived from an extensive discussion on their background in the field, their attitude and goals, and their immediately relevant experience.
                      
                  
      Agreed with (b), we've gotten lots more consistent and turnaround on all the evals has improved substantially (largely because of the person you're all responding to).
                      
                  
      For balance:
I also tried this process because it sounded fun and unique.
Got the assignment within 1 day, all inquiries answered within single day.I still think the process is fun and uniq, so I'll apply again now.
                      
                  
      I love the hiring process at Compose. I myself have applied here. I also love it how they understand the pain points in the hiring process and sympathize with potential candidates.However, I am a little disappointed. Given the process they have and the ranking procedures, unfortunately, the process is very time taking. Been 8+ weeks after I turned in the coding exercises and haven't heard back anything (positive remarks or a rejection) yet. So far I have been to a decent amount of hiring procedures (have been extended 2 offers and declined), and the entire procedure is usually 6-8 weeks. But again those hiring procedures are quite "traditional" compared to how Compose is performing. I guess, patience is virtue :)Anyways, overall I enjoyed working on the problems and exercises. Good luck!
                      
                  
      8 weeks with no communications from us is wrong. Will you email me so I can go see what happened? kurt at compose.io
                      
                  
      I must correct myself here. @mrkurt apologies for misleading information. What I meant was I haven't heard about the next steps or about a rejection. However, I was notified that my submission is in queue and to expect a decision soon. I am 100% in support for the hiring procedures followed by Compose :).What was disappointing was, overall the timeline has been 8+ weeks since submission of coding exercise and a decision on the same isn't available.
                      
                  
      Yeah 8 weeks is terrible, and I'm pretty sure it means something broke. I'm happy to look it up (incidentally, people are very hesitant to email us and ask what's up because they're worried about seeming pushy. They shouldn't be, if a company thinks you're pushy for respecting your time you shouldn't work there).
                      
                  
      Would you mind listing a few past projects and work samples have been?
                      
                  
      Your hiring practices and willingness to disclose pay are refreshing. It would be interesting to read a more detailed case study on how this works for you.
                      
                  
      +1, would love for more info on your "paid work day" experiences
                      
                  
      For me, the paid work day was 8 hours in a Slack chat asking a lot of questions of 1-2 employees.  My task was to get familiar with their existing systems by querying these employees.  I was asked to prepare a report about what I found.The guys seemed busy so for a lot of the day I was on my own, waiting for more information.It was intense, but by the end of the day I had a pretty good sense of the internals.  I think it was a good test overall.
                      
                  
      It sounds like it worked like we want, kind of! The work days should be more interactive than what you experienced, I think. The really good ones seem to be super busy for the first 4 hours, with 3-4 existing employees interacting. The latter half is frequently quiet if people are on the right track.I can guess which position you were going through the process for, and it's something that we've been talking about a lot.One thing we've noticed is that even when it's not perfect, the process we have helps a lot. You had an imperfect work day, but got a good idea of what the actual work is like. I'd rather you have a perfect workday though.
                      
                  
      Can you please add that you are only able to accept candidates from US and Canada, I had my hopes up :( .
                      
                  
      Ah! Out of space in the main post. We are only able to hire those that can legally work within Canada, the US, or the UK.Once hired, fully remote from anywhere.
                      
                  
      By "legally work" do you mean "pay taxes"? Because AFAIK European people can legally work in UK and live or pay taxes in their origin countries (France, Germany, Spain, etc)http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/index_...
                      
                  
      Confirming, EEA citizens can work in the UK, so the hiring pool could technically include the whole EU.
                      
                  
      It's tricky. The hiring pool can technically include the whole EU, but people need to live in the UK while they work here (I believe). We can't hire someone in Germany and have them be employed in the UK.
                      
                  
      > people need to live in the UK while they work hereNot really. The only issue is where the employee wants to pay taxes (and get social benefits), in the UK or in the country of residence. This also applies for UK nationals living abroad in Europe.Generally you're forced to pay local taxes when you spend 183+ days living in the same country (you automatically get resident status), but most of the EU countries have bilateral income tax agreements in order to prevent double-taxation. (you can live in Spain and request tax exemption/return from the UK or Spain gov) and viceversa.It's trickier than simply hiring EU contractors but it's definitely doable (I know some cases) and opens a whole new talent pool for an UK company.https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroadhttps://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice
                      
                  
      How about a Canadian citizen living in China?  Is the requirement mostly about paying taxes?
                      
                  
      I don't think we can employ someone living in China. We have a US citizen living in Japan, but China is a big bag of hurt all by itself.
                      
                  
      I've applied to Compose with equivalent circumstances and was assured that's ok.
Good luck!
                      
                  
      Shame you're not hiring from EU proper :(
                      
                  
      I voted you up, you gave great information to potential candidates and included a rough pay idea, hopefully you'll float to the top. Best of luck!
                      
                  
      Same, I've upvoted everyone who provided a salary estimate. I saw this in action last month and think it's a great principle so I encourage others to do the same.
                      
                  
      While I admire your "blind hiring," I've become increasingly aware that when it comes to team dynamics, EQ matters as much as IQ and social skills/empathy matter as much as ability... (Perhaps that accounts for your $500 "first day.") Has this method been working for you?
                      
                  
      EQ has proven to be of vital importance in growing healthy teams. There was that Google study: http://www.inc.com/robin-camarote/google-study-reveals-emoti...The work-day would be where we assess EQ. It is difficult to stay objective and consistent when assessing soft-skills. It provides the risk that biases and could-be-wrong impressions dictate your hiring decisions.Two things, in my eyes, have helped us find bright and 'good' people:First, by using consistent criteria that are as specific (binary) as possible, we have been able to find people who are not just talented, but conscientious contributors.Secondly, the way we write/pitch/communicate during the process sets the tone for both the people we want and the environment we want to create. If you go through an uncomfortable, even aggressive, hiring process, what would you expect from the environment and the people within that environment? We try for good-ness from word one.
                      
                  
      I always loved Compose - I am the founder of NoSQL.Com and developed a similar business model.  They are a fantastic company.However, my concern is that Compose is now part of IBM.  What guarantee does anyone starting at compose will not be caught in the layoffs?
                      
                  
      I take it you are still following your own hiring process and haven't been bluewashed yet?
                      
                  
      Yes. Our process actually meshes with IBM's reasonably well, people still have to go through the IBM recruiting system (very late in our process) but it's not used for any screening / decisions.
                      
                  
      Even the support and writing roles start at 100k? Seems really high for both.
                      
                  
      Our Support Engineers and Technical Content Creators do real intensive technical work.The role is not important at Compose. The system is built to best groom out 'core competencies'. A Support Engineer is a strong Ops/Systems Administrator with great communication and customer skills. A Technical Content Creator is a strong developer with excellent written communication skill.Our Analytics is maintained, built, and improved by a 'Content Creator'. Our hiring, too, is ran by a 'Content Creator'. Similar folk contribute across the app, and apply skills in various areas.It is a mature way to work. To get the best people, you need to offer competitive wages.
                      
                  
      I'm not interested in applying, but very curious as to what kind of work sample you might have for a systems profile. Is it okay to 'apply' just for the sample?
                      
                  
      What about germany? Do you need a guy to do night shifts while it is day in germany? :)
                      
                  
      What is "First a light application"?

      Thanks for including salary ranges, I like this kind of complete posts.
                      
                  
      $40k in NYC? That's rough.
                      
                  
      $40k for entry level is unfortunately not unusual in NYC for Q/A.  You are not going to get a Q/A 'Engineer' at that rate but maybe someone who has a non-technical background who knows testing or a recent bootcamp grad looking for real world experience.
                      
                  
      Correct and also based on candidates' profile, we could maybe do part-time for this position.
                      
                  
      Yeah, looking at the position, that would pay more than that in Portland. Not sure who is going to do that in NYC.

      Just a quick warning: these guys wasted a lot of my time.
                      
                  
      Thank you for warning us, it's awesome that you posted this, so other people don't waster their time with them.
                      
                  
      I appreciate the feedback and hate thinking we wasted anyone's time. Care to elaborate?
                      
                  
      1. I had a video technical interview and it went well.2. The interviewer said I would make a great fit and tried to introduce me to the CTO.3. I introduced myself to the CTO and received no response.4. I contacted the interviewer a week later. He apologized and tried to contact the CTO again.5. I contacted the interviewer another week later. He apologized and tried to contact the CTO again.6. I contacted the interviewer another week later and he said something along the lines of "We filled the position, sorry we are unprofessional."
                      
                  
      I'm Adam, the CTO. Sincerest apologies that this was your experience and for the communication issues. We're a small team (15 as of today), and our hiring process has certainly had some rough edges, though I think we've put the right processes in place to make sure this doesn't occur moving forward. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss further: adam@statmuse.com.
                      
                  
      I appreciate the apology. My advice would be to take introductions from qualified applicants seriously. I do understand that you are a very busy person, but you should either hire someone to handle the hiring process or take the time to respond to with a simple "We went with someone else."
                      
                  
      That is very unfortunate. A CTO for a well funded small tech company should have recruiting as a top priority if they are looking to grow. It is really the only metric from which to measure an effective technical executive at that stage. It doesn't reflect well if you can't hire because your messaging is off or you aren't well organized.
                      
                  
      Now my messaging is off and I'm unorganized? I can't comment on the circumstances of the original complaint given that I don't know the identity of the person involved. I can say that I've spoken with hundreds of candidates across a variety of technical and non-technical roles. We've hired ~15 over the last year and hope to find more folks that are excited to build with us. I can also say that as a "technical executive" (ha!) my top priority is building a product that people love; hiring is a large part of that. I'd caution against coming to such specific conclusions based off of very little information.
                      
                  
      Apologies if that came across as a personal attack, just a general comment on the expectations of a very early stage CTO. To be clear I don't think your messaging is off, just that that is one of the reasons tech startups aren't able to hire, ie they don't know how to sell the opportunity.However, if the OP is accurate it sounds like you/your organization went through at least a period of disorganization.You deserve a ton of credit for what sounds like a sane approach to technology and including compensation upfront.
                      
                  
      I appreciate the clarification! To be clear, I wouldn't say we've had any issues hiring, save a few hiccups on the communication end early on (I'm aware of one other out-of-band incident similar to the OP's story; perhaps the same instance?). I'm fairly confident we've sorted out any issues with the process at this point, and we're now letting everyone know where they stand consistently and in a timely manner.
                      
                  
      WOW.  This infuriates me.
                      
                  
      Would love to chat if there's anything I can do to alleviate your infuriation: adam@statmuse.com

Since then, we've been working with the government to improve the services HealthCare.gov provides. Our revamped Healthcare.gov application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to fix, and itâ€™s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people. We believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      In my most recent job change, I interviewed with Nava.

We enable dorm room startups to Fortune 500 insurance companies to buid applications on the car. Developers using the platform can create a service that automatically fuels up a driver's car without the driver even having to know by accessing the telematics in the vehicle.We're a well funded startup, have revenue and a great team hailing from Google and LinkedIn looking to add 3 more. Since last month, we've been moved quickly with customers (can talk about it over the phone) and need help with development.Your voice will be heard and you will determine the companyâ€™s future technical roadmap. You will be an excellent generalist who is skilled at multitasking and performs a number of duties, including, but not limited to:
- Designing/architecting the foundational API for cars.

- Integrating with testing, coverage and deployment pipelines.
- Designing SQL database schemas, as well as managing backups and migrations.
- Instrumenting metrics for tracking API usage. - Working with Node.js, Postgres, Redis, Docker, AWS.Interview process is:1. Optional phone call to learn more about the company (415 404 5650).2.

      I reached out to this employer during last month's Who Is Hiring thread. They sent me one email saying they really thought I had a strong background, then another email asking me for times when I would be available to have an interview.I listed several times in my reply, but then I did not receive any follow-up communication of any kind. No confirmation, no rejection, just no response of any kind.Hopefully they have addressed and fixed this unprofessionalism in their hiring process, but it is good for others to be aware that it is possible to simply never hear from them after they have asked you for schedule information.
                      
                  
      Our sincerest apologies that things slipped through. We were able to identify you based on the description above, and I'll personally follow up in hopes of making amends.Last month was our first time posting in the HN Hiring thread, and we didn't know how much volume we'd get. We responded in a very ad-hoc fashion, without implementing enough process around it. After some promising candidates came through the HN pipeline last month, we built out a bit more process for this month -- your feedback is very valuable and we'll do our best to prevent similar failure modes from happening again for other candidates.
                      
                  
      I just wanted to add that Andrew did reach out and offer an apology over the mistake in their process. As I told him, I think this speaks very highly of Predata. Very few companies would be willing to do such a human gesture. It sounds like they have the hiring management sorted out now and you can all effectively disregard my earlier comment. I am glad to hear it.

      1aim - Berlin, Germany | Onsite, Full Time, VisaAt 1aim (https://1aim.com), we develop and produce access control systems, which allow to open doors with mobile phones. We create all hardware, software and IT-Infrastructure to run our systems on our own. Beside access systems we are already putting a lot of R&D effort in creating further new smart home/building automation products. We see ourselves as an engineering-driven technology company, that influences how a future with connected devices will look.We enable engineers to focus on what they can to best, letting them work on new products in small, highly interdisciplinary teams. We get rid of management overhead and daily standup meetings. We have almost no rules and flexible working hours, your contribution is the what counts. Right now, we are hiring new engineers for the following areas:- RUST Backend Developer (with a focus on high security/cryptography)- (Frontend) Web Developer- App Developer (iOS)- Electrical Engineer- Mechanical EngineerWe do not care about your academic degrees or where you are from, but about the stuff you did and what you could create in the future given the right opportunities. If you are interested in working at 1aim, write us an email at work.hn<?>1aim.com and tell us about the projects you worked on that you are the most proud of and which technological feats of the past inspire you. We provide visa assistance, relocation support and free housing until you find your own place to live.Interview process: 1st phone interview (screening) -> 2nd phone interview (technical) -> home assignment/technical challenge (depending on application) -> 3rd interview (mixed, via phone or onsite)
                      
                  
      When I applied, the interview process went like this:> 1st phone interview (screening) -> 2nd phone interview (technical) -> [crickets]I get it, we are all busy, but I think sending a "No, thanks" email to applicants who have spent time on your interviews isn't asking too much.
                      
                  
      > > 1st phone interview (screening) -> 2nd phone interview (technical) -> [crickets]I had the exact same experience, around the same time. I just assumed I was a bad fit, but it would have been nice to know why. The company seems pretty cool, from what I could tell.
                      
                  
      Sure, we'll find out and write you. We were extremely busy in December/January and didn't have a dedicated HR/Recruiting manager yet.
                      
                  
      Same here
                      
                  
      I'm very sorry for that. Sometimes we miss a follow-up and I always hate when it happens :(
We will investigate this case and I'll send you the result within the next 2 days.
                      
                  
      Don't worry about it. This was back in December, so there is no point digging it up now. I just needed to vent.
                      
                  
      We've just added a "production users" page to our site, by the way! If you'd like to get 1aim on it: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/showcasing-rust-in-production-...
                      
                  
      Thanks for the suggestion Steve! I'll submit a request today :)
                      
                  
      Do you have any more information about the company beyond the website. I would like to better understand the products being developed, who the founding team is and understand the vision of the company and how it intends to compete against the behemoths in the access control business.
                      
                  
      Good Questions!- Products: We are offering modern lock hardware (which we developed ourselves) and deeply integrated, modern access management solutions. This combination is what enables us to offer much more attractive products that can be integrated into existing customer infrastructure and enables them to save a lot of the costs they currently have for managing access by automating processes that are mostly manual today. It also enables them to be much more flexible in the way access rights are managed and keys are issued, as well as achieving a higher level of security.- Team: We started about 3 years ago and currently have a team of 15 (2 founders).- Vision: Long term, we see ourselves as a player in the building automation/"IoT" field, as it turns out locks/doors are an excellent starting point for that.- Competition: Apart from our products being superior to existing solutions, we are supported by some well-known people in the  industry and have a partnership with one of the largest players in the market (they don't make actual lock hardware themselves, so we are not in competition to each other).
                      
                  
      Do you guys do summer internships?
                      
                  
      Unfortunately, we don't offer any kind of internships at the moment :(
                      
                  
      WalmartLabs - Clojure Developer. | SF | Remote (US Timezones) | H1B VISAYou can work on Clojure at quite a few companies, but rarely can you impact millions of people at such a personal level. We're a small, flat team of engineers building mission critical applications for Walmart Grocery. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. We use pull requests & code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.Some aspects of our work that are important to us:  - high performance distributed systems 
  - robust & well-factored codebases 
  - simple & fast deployments 
  - automating the hell out of operations 
  - thorough system test coverage 
  - managing our own development process and work backlog 
  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely) 
  - contributing back to the clojure & open source community 

What we do:  - write all our production systems & tools in Clojure 
  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems 
  - spin up web services for handling large volumes of data

      I interviewed with these people a few months ago. Unfortunately I didn't get an offer but out of all the companies I've interviewed at they've been probably the best interview experience.To elaborate, I liked the fact the interview was take home questions that seemed relevant to the actual job but still were pretty interesting, plus they even offered (unsolicited) to compensate me for taking the time to interview. Also the whole process was pretty fast, no dragging around waiting to here back from them.Definitely left a positive impression!

      I interviewed at Percolate a few months ago and it was a really disorganized and offputting process. I had to wait in the lobby for 10 mins (I showed up on time) while people ran around and tried to figure things out and then they directed me to another floor where I had to wait another 10 minutes. And then the interview was conducted in an incredibly loud and distracting open office, not in a private room or anything like that. I was constantly interrupted by people trying to talk to the interviewer - I guess they didn't realize it was an interview? - and he wanted me to code stuff out on pieces of scrap paper (like actually torn paper from a notebook) and pen.Hopefully this has been remedied but it was honestly a very negative process.
                      
                  
      Thanks for your feedback. I appreciate it and it's feedback like this that has led to many positive changes at Percolate.
If I pin-pointed your interview activity accurately, you might have interviewed in June/July of last year when, admittedly, things were in flux. I joined in late August of 2015, and I've been part of enhancing the candidate experience for all of our candidates and the candidates who make it through our rigorous interviews are delighted by the experience and practically always end up choosing Percolate. 
This is an issue we have taken very seriously, and it is continuously improved upon at Percolate.
                      
                  
      It's great to hear that. I have no qualms whatsoever with Percolate and those who I know work there highly recommended it so I was a bit surprised at how the interview went. But thanks for taking the time to respond to me, it's really nice to know that the process is being improved upon!
                      
                  
      Just to reiterate what Chin said: Really sorry about that experience and I believe we've done quite a bit to remedy it. Thanks for the comment.

      About a half XSLT jobs on Upwork seems to be from students trying to get their assignments done :) Which is pretty sad, I think.

      I was very excited to read through this job description (at first). I have become very jaded with the software industry and its pattern of incestuous development (i.e., technology for technology for technology). Teaching, however, is something I've always had a passion for, though never pursued. In my college days, I was always hanging around the computer labs helping people understand course material, both because I enjoyed helping others learn, and I realized that the more I taught, the more I understood the material myself.Unfortunately, while I'm an experienced full-stack JavaScript engineer (primarily working in the MEAN stack), I have no experience with Rails, nor am I a graphic designer with extensive Photoshop knowledge. So, here I am, in between the UI/UX and Fullstack Mentor positions -- AKA Bummersville.Either way, the non-traditional education provided by Bloc looks fantastic, and ultimately, I'm very happy to see these programs becoming more popular, even if there's no place for me to be apart of it.

      Nexon | El Segundo, CA | Technical Lead/Lead Programmer | ONSITE | (VISA possible)Nexon is creating a new PC game development incubator at its Nexon America office in southern California. A small team (6-10) will conceive and prototype a game concept, eventually growing to a production team of 20-30 developers. (Nexon is currently best known for F2P mobile games, but that is not the focus of this incubator team.)My name's Kevin Saunders and I'm leading this new initiative at Nexon. (Games I've worked on in the past include Shattered Galaxy (MMORTS), Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer, and Torment: Tides of Numenera.) I am currently seeking candidates to form the core of this new studio within Nexon. This is an opportunity to work in a small team environment and help establish a new product and a team culture, but with the support of an established corporation.We will begin from an existing engine, such as Unity or Unreal. You will be a/the key technical voice within this team.Depending upon your interests, you will be either a senior engineer/architect for the prototype (and later the game) or a lead programmer who grows and mentors a small team of engineers. (In this latter case, you'll still be writing code, at least during the prototyping phase.)5+ years of programming experience, please. Previous professional game development experience NOT required, but please have significant experience with one or more game engines. (I have had some great experiences working with programmers who wanted to transition from other industries, but in these cases game development was at least a hobby.) I'm looking for the right person/people more than I'm looking for a specific skill profile.Salary: $120+K
Comprehensive benefits package, including unlimited vacation timeCasual inquiries are OK. Let us know what you're interests are and what you've been working on. We are a small group within Nexon and so our interview practices are still evolving, but coding tests are not part of our process.If you may be interested, please contact Aaron Morrison (amorrison@nexon.net). Thanks!
                      
                  
      This sounds like a pretty cool opportunity for someone looking to migrate into gamedev from another flavour of software engineering. Given that most paths into gamedev seem to require working for terrible pay and several years of forced crunch as a junior, this sounds like a way to jump that queue if you've already proved your programming chops elsewhere.

      MPD Group |  Manchester, UK | Full time, ONSITEWe are looking for developers who enjoy solving problems, find coding fun, like being part of an agile team, are not afraid to try new approaches, yet easily abandon 'false-starts', like clean code, have strongly developed common sense, and take pride in things they build.You would be working on Electio - our newly built and constantly evolving SaaS fulfillment management platform (more about Electio - http://electiodelivers.com/). Electio already does some great things which won us major clients, but that's just a start. We're excited to see what else we can make it do, how we can innovate in a challenging market, and delight our customers.Electio has to comply with very strict response SLAs and at the same time handle large, 'spiky' volumes of data, therefore designing for performance, reviewing and optimising your code would be essential.We believe you should test your own code. We're not particular if you cover it with meaningful tests before or after you've written it - as long as you do.You should also be ok with deploying your own code in a controlled manner.We use relatively new technology stack (.Net 4.6.1, C#, MVC 4.5, Nancy, SQL Server 2014, Redis, Dapper, ELK, and Azure Service Bus).We keep our code in BitBucket, for continuous integration we use TeamCity, we adopted Gitflow as our branching strategy, and we manage our deployments via Octopus. All our environments are deployed in Azure.Our interview process is single-stage 2-2.5 hours interview, which involves a coding task.  For candidates considering a relocation, we offer an alternative, slightly longer technical test which you can do in your own time.If you would like to become part of our team, please drop me a quick email to hn@mpd-group.com.

      DotDashPay | Full Stack Engineer | $100,000 - $115,000 + A Nice Chunk of Equity | San Francisco | On-SiteDotDashPay (https://dotdashpay.com) is a hardware and software platform that makes it easy for machine builders and designers to connect their machines to payments. Our long-term goal is to enable a completely autonomous economy by providing companies with tools that make it simple to build machines that automate the transaction process. Weâ€™re a venture backed company with a strong founding team from UC Berkeley (our founders grew out of the CS PhD program).Weâ€™re looking for a full stack developer who wants to develop extremely reliable, clean, well-tested, and downright beautiful systems. Weâ€™ve found that a very productive and powerful way to do this is to write code that writes our code for us: autogeneration is the foundation of DotDashPay, and in this paradigm you can become a 100x engineer (building on top of our autogenerators will allow you to ship new features in hours instead of weeks).On top of our autogeneration framework, we write most of our complex features in a combination of C, C++, and Go (golang). We are currently using Node.js as our web backend language and are migrating our frontend to React. Strong experience in at least a couple of these languages, and the desire to learn the others, is important to us.Desirable characteristics:* Polyglot programmer: we have APIs in almost every major language that are autogenerated from our specification. The APIs require small glue code that is written in the target language and needs to conform to the standards / conventions of that language.* Experience building/managing infrastructure: as a small team, everyone helps build and manage our infrastructure. We use many modern tools and services (Docker, Ansible, AWS) and strive to build things the Right Wayâ„¢, so weâ€™re always open to trying a new ideas and tools.* Security experience: our payment systems must support some of the biggest names in retail, and our codebase undergoes rigorous security testing and certifications. A strong understanding of security best practices helps ensure that our products ship faster and our customers can rely on our software.* Experience / interest in payments: payments is a surprisingly fascinating and complex iceberg. Even if you know very little now, a desire to learn more is important as it pervades most of what we do.Please email Sean Arietta via sean (at) dotdashpay (dot) com to set up a time for an initial chat.
