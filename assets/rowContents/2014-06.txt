      Hi Greg. Can you clarifyâ€”â€œremotely within US timezonesâ€� is  located in US or working within US hours? Or literally: located within US timezones?
                      
                  
      "Working within US hours" is what matters to us. (Being in US timezones is probably the easiest way to achieve that, but if you want to work US hours within your local timezone we could probably make do.)
                      
                  
      Westlake Robotics - Seattle, WA. - Software DevelopersWhat are we about?We're a new team trying to use the best tools and techniques to move forward the state of the art in software development while making innovative software services to improve patient health and reduce healthcare costs.  We respect each other. We work in small batches. We max out the RAM in our laptops. We drink coffee on Monday mornings and classic cocktails on Friday afternoons. We try to be cutting edge without getting caught up in meaningless buzzwords and flaky vaporware.  We use effective methodologies without being dogmatic or cargo-culty.What are we looking for?That depends. What do you have to bring? We're staffing up an entirely new team with a flexible and changing set of technologies, so we're not rigid in specific job requirements. We just want talented people who care about making great software in an enjoyable and sustainable way. If that's you, please email westlake.robots@gmail.com or contact me directly. Contact info is in my profile.Where are we?Our office is in Seattle. As the team is still forming, we're hesitant to add the extra complexity of working with non-local talent at this time. My hope is that we'll eventually become a geographically dispersed team, but we're limiting our search to local talent right now. I have no idea if we can provide relocation assistance, but if you're thinking of moving out here, let me know.
                      
                  
      I can't find any website for your company. Care to share more details?
                      
                  
      We have a very small recruiting web site up at http://www.westlakerobotics.com I'm a little unsure about which details are OK with me to share, as I'm a coder, not a recruiter, but here's some more stuff:We're a new (~3 month old) development lab of a well established company in the healthcare information / transaction processing space.  Sort of skunk-works, sort of pilot program. We're supported by the "mother ship", but we're building both the software and the team from the ground up.We chose "robotics" as a guiding metaphor for our strong focus on build/test/deploy/monitor automation.We're using Amazon Web Services and open-source tools (Java, Gradle, Spring Framework) wherever possible.

      What is your stack for Desktop client? And would you be interested in client engineer?
                      
                  
      On the desktop we are web browser based entirely. Only non-web clients are two Android phone/tablet apps.
                      
                  
      Interesting how web stack (I guess node.js/webkit) targets the niche for cross-platform desktop thick clients, where C++ and some good toolkit like Qt or wxWidgets is a good fit.
                      
                  
      For our purpose a desktop client doesn't feel like a good fit. There is little that a desktop app offers in our context that provides advantages over the web stack.

      All: someone downvoted many comments in this thread. We are undoing all of those downvotes and applying them instead to the post they were intended to promote. We're also banning the accounts that did it, at least until we get a promise that this will never happen again.We'll probably also write some code to find any other accounts that have done this.I'm reluctant to disable downvoting on the "who is hiring" threads, because not all posts to these threads are appropriate, and the community does a good job of handling those.

Vurb is working on reinventing search, browsing, and sharing - by creating an intelligent layer over the Internet that helps you get things done in one place.We do this by connecting the services we use in a contextual way, through data technologies (search, machine learning, big data, etc.) and original thinking around UI/UX.We're funded by Max Levchin, Drew Houston (Dropbox), Naval Ravikant (AngelList), CrunchFund, and many others. This is a hard problem, but it has the potential to change the behavior of how we do things on the Internet.Full-time opportunities in San Francisco (3+ yrs experience, interview on-site)* Search / Data Sciencist / Data Engineer - search, classification, ranking, machine learning, recommendation systems, NLP, graph databases, data crawling/processing.

      Remote / Async / Anywhere for contract work (perm if we can get off the ground)Untitled Advanced Science Show Lecture SeriesWe're Atlanta-based and in need of some biology, chemistry, and physics PhDs (or students; perhaps even really good grads).We want to film 15 minute science lectures that are much more advanced than Cosmos or NOVA, but we need research and writing. Existing formats are drawn out; we can be informationally dense and fast-paced. We'll include a few relevant figures; we'll also add footnotes, equations, and primary literarure citations for those that want to pause and do their own further exploration.A perfect description of our demographic is HN--educated adults who might not actually be pursuing the field we're covering but have a ton of interest in science. This market also includes advanced college and high school students that likewise share the same level of interest.The lectures can be broad surveys or deep coverage of a particular area of research or discovery.
We're going to fund filming about 3 videos, film them here in Atlanta, and then test the market for fit (ie. "Show HN"). If the market demands a less "smart" or info-dense video, we'll probably abandon the project. Our goal is to fill the perceived lack of advanced material, not clone the existing formats.bt at brand dot io

Our first[1] is for wireless signal where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible.  Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal[2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper[3] showing the potential of this approach.If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch.  We are hiring for all manner of different roles right not (backend, frontend, UX/UI & data science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills.More info: http://opensignal.com/jobs/[1]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.staircase3...

      Thread.com (YC S12) - Software engineer who loves product (Python/Django) London, England. https://www.thread.com/jobs/software-engineerWe're a startup trying to reinvent retail so men can dress well without being subject to the horrors of the high street or having to trawl through millions of items online. We do this using a combination of powerful algorithms and human stylists.You'd be joining a small, highly technical team with a ton of startup experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before). You'll be one of the first technical hires and get to build and own huge parts of the product and work on the core algorithms. One of our ancillary goals is to build one of the best engineering cultures anywhere, and we'd love you to help us do that. We launched in October and user and revenue numbers are scaling extremely quickly. We're backed by a collection of the top investors from London and Silicon Valley as well as Y Combinator.We're especially interested in people who are interested in founding their own startup one day. We view working at Thread as a founder bootcamp where you'll learn about all parts of starting and growing a startup.Want to learn more?

They'd also have strong communication skills, as they'd be shifting focus month to month to try to spend time with lots of our brand websites and would meet with senior leaders of those brands to talk over their findings.If you or someone you know is interested, drop me a line at sully.syed@rci.rogers.com . You'd be coming to work at 350 Bloor St. E for a division that acts like a startup-within-a-company, with people who aren't afraid to experiment and are trying to forment a data-driven culture.

We operate a very peculiar network based on a proprietary fixed wireless access platform and with unusually high backhauling mesh factor [1] which provides both extremely high redundancy and extremely painful headaches :)Frustrated by the limitations of the big vendors [2] we decided to engineer our own SDN platform, based on a custom network appliance we designed on a multi-core CPU [3], Linux and OpenVSwitch.It is a "bold" move to build what we expect to become the hardware platform our country-wide network.We are now trying to set-up a small team (headcount <=4) focused on this project. We are based near Milan, Italy, but for this specific workgroup we are looking to form a distributed/remote team.Essential requirements:* already familiar with openvswitch* development will be in C and nodejs (most of our network services are aready in nodejs: dhcp, radius, syslog, etc)* full-time commitment, this is not a freelance postFeel free to get in touch: mino@ngi.it[1] i.e., the number of backhaul links per radio tower[2] See the old but still very inspiring James Hamilton's rant: http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2009/12/19/NetworkingTheLas...[3] http://www.tilera.com/sites/default/files/images/products/TI...

The Apportable SDK automatically converts iOS applications to Android, without extensive changes to the original codebase.  Optimized for performance, Apportable cross-compiles the Objective-C code to machine code that runs directly on the Android deviceâ€™s processor, as opposed to translating the app to Java or running a virtual machine.With Apportable, developers can use the best tools (Objective-C and Xcode), seamlessly maintain app parity, focus on feature development instead of rewriting a second codebase, and reduce time-to-market or launch simultaneously! Not only that, games that run Objective-C on Android will normally perform better than an equivalent Java version.Release Manager; Mobile Games: http://apportable.theresumator.com/apply/aHb8Ny/Release-Mana...Software Engineer; Graphics: http://apportable.theresumator.com/apply/pwWHvV/Software-Eng...Software Engineer; Mobile Consultant: http://apportable.theresumator.com/apply/rSj3z6/Software-Eng...Software Engineer; SDK Platform: http://apportable.theresumator.com/apply/AXsBPW/Software-Eng...Project Manager: http://apportable.theresumator.com/apply/mDx3Ep/Project-Mana...

      Company: TheLadders (http://www.theladders.com)Location: New York, NYPostion: Full-time on-site software engineerTheLadders' mission is to match people with the jobs that are right for them. In order to do that we need a strong engineering team.Currently we are looking for a software engineer to join our Platform Engineering Team. This team is responsible for developing and maintaining the software and systems that power our websites, mobile applications, and marketing.A few things about us:* We try to use the right tool for the right job; maybe a shell script, maybe multiple Storm topologies communicating via RabbitMQ and reading data from internal web services. And while we have found some tools that work, we're always willing to incorporate new ones if they give us a new way of tackling a problem.* We know that engineering is all about understanding tradeoffs, not applying the same solution over and over again to every problem.* Sometimes we get to work with fun new tools (Scala, Clojure, Storm, Elastic Search), sometimes we work with old standards (Java, Python, Bash). Sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.* We think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job. We are responsible for what we put out in the world, including monitoring and maintainence.A few things about you:* You're an engineer, but you know how to think like an operations person.* You cut your teeth in open source software, and know how to find documents, read the source, ask for help, and report a bug.* You're excited about glamorous work, but you're willing to sometimes do shit work, because in the end somebody has do it.If this sounds interesting and you think you'd be a good match, or if you're interested in learning the skills to become a good match, please get in touch with Andrew Turley (aturley@theladders.com).

      Rinse - San Francisco, CA https://www.rinse.comDespite the negative press recently, Laundry and Dry Cleaning really are problems that would benefit from today's technical prowess.  Modernizing laundry has real environmental benefits to water usage, not to mention the convenience factor of a delivery service.  As humanity becomes more and more urban and less and less likely to have space for a personal washer and dryer, demand for efficient laundry service is growing.Rinse needs to tackle interesting technical challenges as well.  Of course, the routing problem as popularized by the Traveling Salesman Problem (except with multiple, load-balanced agents) is a challenge, but since we are also taking photos of the clothes we process, there are interesting data mining, machine learning, and image processing applications as well.  This is in addition to the joys of rapidly scaling an operational system, while continually optimizing a consumer-facing product.We're looking for skilled developers of all types to join us.  Since we haven't taken any VC yet, this is a chance to earn a significant equity stake (while still earning a competitive salary).  We're a Python/Django/Heroku/AWS/PostGIS/Backbone/Sass shop currently, but since we're small, there are opportunities to steer us technically as well.More information at https://www.rinse.com/careers/ or just contact us at jobs@rinse.com

      Hm, that page doesn't provide a PGP key for the iwanttohack address, neither is there one on pgp.mit.edu. :( I do find two keys of you personally on pgp.mit.edu, 0x1DBE9880 from 1999 with an mit.edu address and 0x6BA33506 from 2000 with a mindspring.com address, but none with a duckduckgo.com address. Typically public keys that old without a contemporary e-mail address are no longer in use and the corresponding private key has often been lost.It would be nice if you could make a new key available (RSA with 3072 or 4096 bit) for either the iwanttohack address or your own address, and preferrably link to it on your hiring page. It would underscore your privacy credo and help you stand out from the crowd. (Sadly, even here in the HN Who's Hiring thread, few people have a PGP key and even fewer include it in their job postings.)

      I've got a few questions:1. What level are you looking for in a developer (Mid/Senior)?2. I see you have things segregated out as JS, Android, Ruby and so forth. How much cross-interaction is there between the roles? For instance I have extremely strong Java and Javascript skills but I'm not sure my Android knowledge would be up to snuff to do it as my primary job.3. It seems your working language is English? I just wanted to confirm since I wouldn't trust my German in a professional environment.
