      Holy crap, I've been looking for something (from a user's perspective) like this for ages. Not doing web stuff anymore so not applying but can't wait to check this out.
                      
                  
      BoA has offered this as a feature called "ShopSafe" on their Mastercard since forever, but weirdly it's totally buried and is so neglected that you need to use a Flash app to generate new numbers.
                      
                  
      Agreed. Schwab is rolling out a similar product called Eno, but this seems much nicer and avoids bank lock-in.
                      
                  
      Capital One, not Schwab.
                      
                  
      Defense MicroElectronics Activity (DMEA) | Electronics Engineer, Embedded Hardware Engineer, Embedded Software Engineer | Full-time | Sacramento, CA | Onsite | $70 - $120kWho: A Department of Defense (DoD) field activity that has been operating since 1997. Small and engineer-centric: ~200 employees of which ~180 are engineer/scientist.What: Provide solutions to other US Government agencies and allies. Some tasks are engineering brand-new products and some tasks are re-engineering devices to keep legacy systems running. We do not compete with private industry but regularly work side-by-side with industry to get stuff done. We also have the only semiconductor foundry (90nm) still operational within the federal government.Why: US Government agencies sometimes want products built that are so technologically risky or low-volume that private industry does not want to do them. Wes step in to fill the gap.Where: Sacramento, CA -- California's fourth largest metro area. Home to two major state universities (CSU-Sacramento and UC-Davis). The farm-to-fork (and regular) capital of California.Benefits: We are federal employees and receive federal benefits (google "opm benefits" for more info). Time off starts at 36 days/year (13 vacation + 13 sick + 10 federal holidays) and grows to 49 days/year over time (26 + 13 + 10). We have flexible schedules and most of us work a "9-to-5.â€� Hiring is for GS-11/12/13 engineers (google â€œgs pay scale 2018â€� and look at the Sacramento locality).==Interview==Must be a US citizen. Must be able to achieve and maintain a security clearance.2 x Phone call [1 hr] >> Onsite w/team [full day]==Apply==Apply on USAJobs: https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/496037600hn@dmea.osd.mil with questions (please do not contact if you are a recruiter)
                      
                  
      The background check process is involved (taking ~3-24 months), and since clearance is condition of employment, employees are sometimes let go if they fail to obtain a clearance. For anyone interested, clearedjobs[1] has a good faq about how clearances are obtained and adjudicated. Before applying, it's worth asking yourself if you want to go through the process and possibly risk having to leave the job if you fail to obtain a clearance.As far as compensation goes, government pay will always be a little lower. Our new grad pay is notoriously low (GS 5-9), but we'll pay for your background check and a Masters/PHD if you're interested. For engineers with ~5-10 years experience GS-13 pay ($95k-$120k) is pretty competitive when you consider the cost of living in Sacramento (A nice 4bed/2bath house, in a great neighborhood is ~$400k). Additionally, we have management and technical promotions tracks within the organization of which both go up to GS-15 (non-management GS-15 jobs are pretty rare within the federal government).[1] https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs
                      
                  
      Translation: accept lower pay because you're doing interesting work in the national interest with good job security and benefits; go through a background check because that's part of getting a job like this
                      
                  
      For all you know they'll task you with writing assembler for a 1980s vintage cpu controlling m113 Bradley internal combustion engines.
                      
                  
      Programming jobs don't get much better than that. I guess you could program the Voyager probe for NASA, which is even older. Programming missiles would be fun too; I've heard that memory leaks are accepted because it will be set free upon impact. Medical implants and spy equipment are probably fun too, with 8-bit CPUs being likely.This kind of stuff sure beats web and phone app programming to sell ads, cause addiction, and scoop up people's lifestyles.
                      
                  
      If you want peace, you have to be prepared for war. We're currently the better part of a century into The Long Peace, something that has never happened before in human history, and it came about in part because of weapons development.The same tools that provide the means for evil also provide the means for subjugating evil.That said obviously we get into a lot of unnecessary war where a lot of people die who didn't need to. Still, you'd be a fool to sit on your hands while Russia and China race ahead in weapons development, with lower regard for human rights than the rest of us. You don't want them knocking on the door.

      "without you all this killing cant go on": It's impossible to disarm, because it's impossible to prove the other guy (russia, china) is being honest about disarming.The long peace has lasted 50 more years since that song was written.Do you have a particular point to make regarding the song?
                      
                  
      Long peace? The US is in the longest war in our history.Edit: second longest, but still > 16 years. We'll break the record soon enough.
                      
                  
      The Long Peace means there have been no wars between major powers since 1945, we fear nuclear weapons. All wars now engaged in by great powers are asymmetric.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Peacealso see http://www.fallen.io/ and https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-59-the-destroyer-...
                      
                  
      We do a lot of work on ARM Cortex processors and TI MSP430s. On a recent project the main processor was an Atmel ATSAMA5D3x running embedded linux. Most of the embedded work is C but some engineers use C++. There's a lot of peripheral support software we write as well, which is usually in C# or python. It's easily been 15+ years since we've done any projects in assembly.
                      
                  
      That sounds interesting as hell. Also, when else do you get to test your code by driving an armored vehicle.
                      
                  
      There's more to life than money (like getting to work on cool stuff), plus you know the government isn't going to shut down in 9 months like every startup, or get acquired, or "restructure" your job to puff up the numbers this quarter.
                      
                  
      The OPM hack is something that already happened, in the past, to files that were current at that time. It is not known to be ongoing.
                      
                  
      And it left me with such great confidence in the OPM's security!
                      
                  
      The OPM hack was a succession of hacks over a few years with long detection & dwell times. Hard to turn that kind of ship..Anyways, pretty fascinating.. as long as you and your colleagues aren't in the database. We work on tools to bring visibility & reliability to these kinds of incidents, it's pretty wild in practice!

      No visa sponsorship, oh no ;/
                      
                  
      I spent time doing the challenge too and then got an impersonal no visa template response. HNers beware.
                      
                  
      I had fun solving the challenge tho :) I might post it to a gist or something ehhehe
                      
                  
      That's why you shouldn't do any quizzes or tests even before talking to a human being.
                      
                  
      You are correct, but all in all, it was a fun to solve quiz, so it counted as some brain exercise :-) I wasn't reaaaally confident of anything heehe.

      > Regardless of where you're applying this year I'd say make sure you focus your application on specific roles, highlight your work and personal projects (over academics) and don't treat interview results as a reflection of personal worth. Good luck with your job hunt !.That is an incredibly sweet thing to say.In the beginning of my career I often beat myself up (not literally!) over rejections and it contributed to my imposter syndrome. I realized later that job interviews look for very specific skills and are definitely not (and can't) be a comprehensive assessment of one's personal skills; or a predictor of future success.
                      
                  
      Absolutely, I think everyone who runs these interviews knows that they miss out on great employees.Theres so many random variables in an interview that a candidate/interviewer can't control.

The official ad is here: https://ripple.com/company/careers/all-jobs/#senior-software...The team knows the C++ language well. Two members regularly attend committee meetings and one member has made substantial contributions to the language. If you like working with C++, you'll be very happy here.

      Can you elaborate on what you mean by "remote first", given that you also have a SF office?I realize the two concepts aren't necessarily incompatible, but I'm curious how you avoid preferential treatment for non-remote workers.  For example, you advertise "Fully-stocked kitchen with organic snacks, beverages and coffee drinks" for people working out of your SF office, so I'm curious if/how you show equivalent love to your remote workers.
                      
                  
      I first heard the term "remote first" from a stack overflow blog post: https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/02/08/means-remote-first-com...The key takeaway for me was: Remote-first means working remote is the default. It means making sure your remote employees are as much a part of the team as those in the office.The team I work with - the rippled team - is 100% remote. Other teams within ripple work mostly onsite.

      Hi - Iâ€™m interested in the Front End position, but the application page is a general purpose contact form with no way to send a resume (as far as I can tell). Any further instructions for submitting an application?
                      
                  
      You have to enter the information and press enter. More boxes pop up so you can enter more information. I agree its unintuitive.
                      
                  
      I got that. It just seemed like the information they gathered was inadequate to be a job application.
                      
                  
      ooo I'm moving back to Boston in a month or so and this is right up my alley :)

      â€œUnlimited paid vacation?â€� Really? How do you prevent abuse?
                      
                  
      Generally this is a way for companies to get out of paying your outstanding vacation you haven't taken when you quit or get laid off.
                      
                  
      Not necessarily. I have worked for two companies now with unlimited vacation policies that pay out for two weeks when you leave regardless of what vacation you took.
                      
                  
      It's still a way of getting out of paying for accrued vacation if they pay out two weeks at separation no matter how little vacation you took while working.
                      
                  
      Like every other unlimited gimmick, it's a gimmick. Use too much and you'll find unlimited is very much subject to limits.
                      
                  
      That's the pessimistic view.The optimistic view is that they encourage you to do what's most healthy for you and don't track your vacation days.As with any other benefit, don't abuse it.
                      
                  
      Unlimited means "unlimited subject to manager approval". Try taking more than 2-3 weeks off and you will find the limits of unlimited PTO.

Over 40,000 restaurants, bars, hotels, and retail stores across the country connect with their sales reps and wholesalers through our platform, replacing a status quo going back to Prohibition. We work with everyone from the largest importers to mom and pop winemakers to build bespoke tools for communication and content distribution and provide transparency across all tiers.You'll be joining a small engineering team tackling a wide array of challenges - from complex data processing to modern, interactive web frontends; from liberating data from decades old mainframes, to consuming and writing APIs used by everyone from small retail shops to large conglomerates. We want people who are excited about learning new technologies and passionate about transforming a broken industry. We're also in a sweet spot for ambitious and talented engineers; we have a lot of traction and are well-financed, but still have a very small team responsible for a wide range of work enabling you to take ownership of large slices of our technology stack.Technologies: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Backbone, React, small bit of ClojureContact steve (at) sevenfifty.com
                      
                  
      For the curious. I tried to get data out of a wine wholesaler in California once about their supply chain (we had an interesting application for a product to discuss). Turns out even if they wanted to they couldn't get the data we needed because it would mean go back through years of paper records in an offsite storage facility. This industry could very much use some love.
                      
                  
      It's a remarkable industry to be a part of. We work with wholesalers of all sizes (we have 8 of the top 10 nationally as customers, along with hundreds of very small business that run on quickbooks or excel). A major part of our company and engineering challenge is integrating with the backend systems at all of those companies, grabbing whatever information they can send on a recurring basis, and standardizing it on one schema. We've produced the most complete dataset of what's available for purchase wholesale for any licensed establishment in the U.S. (at least in the 40 states we operate in, we have to go state-by-state due to the regulations).Right now we're looking for mid-senior (at a minimum able to write idiomatic full-stack rails/JS code from the start) people to help build more software on top of the dataset, but it's the dataset that's the core of everything we do. One definition of enterprise software is software where the data will outlive the applications that lay on top of it, and we definitely fit that bill.

      fly.io | Writer / Dev Advocate | Chicago or Remote | Full Time
fly.io is an open source, programmable CDN. Developers write JavaScript Edge Applications locally, test them, and deploy across our global network of servers.We're hiring to improve our publishing! You might want to apply if you enjoy JavaScript and writing for developers. You'll be really good for this role if you can come up with interesting ideas and turn them into finished content. We're remote first, and super flexible, so you hopefully like talking to other people on Slack and getting together with the rest of the company every few months. If you like giving talks and going to conferences, you can do that too (but it's not a requirement).Publishing is one of the most important things we do. It's how devs learn about us, how we get customers, and a good thing to work on if you want your work to a direct impact. This is not a secondary job at an already successful company, this hire matters.Example content:* https://fly.io/articles/fly-edge-apps-advanced-http-routing/* https://onehostname.comSalary is is competitive, our equity grants are relatively large (up to 2% of the company), and we offer health benefits for US based employees.To apply, send an email to jobs@fly.io. Please include a developer focused writing sample, and links to any code you've written.
                      
                  
      Just wanna throw in that fly.io is an incredible concept:a) Set up a "Site" and add caching and HTTPS with ease. Inject analytics with one button press on their web GUI. Free (credit) tier and services as low as $1/month after that.b) Create an "Edge App", basically program your own CDN/DNS, deployed to Fly's 18 servers, in the same language you use on the front-end, the latest Javascript. Use their API to cache however you like, re-route `/pathnames`, and so on. Even resize or watermark images based on the request. Or just import something from NPM.c) Their "Wormhole" product lets you load-blanace without nginx, just by adding some text to your Dockerfile. I've deployed a swarm to Docker across several VPS using this, no nginx config required.You can start with no credit card, only caveat is you need a DNS with flattened CNAMEs (for root) or ANAMEs or ALIASs (unless you only wanna use subdomains).
