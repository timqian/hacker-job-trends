      Microsoft | Consultants, Architects, Software Engineers, and everything else| REMOTE, INTERNS, WORLDWIDEMicrosoft is recruiting across all technical roles. Our engineering roles are primarily located in the major tech hubs (Seattle/Redmond, Bay Area, Boston, London, etc...), but we also have a large remote "field" doing application development work in consulting, highly advanced technical support, and technical sales support.We write code and provide advice that delivers the largest, most complex and strategic implementations of Microsoft technologies for external customers. As we are a distributed organization, at least 50% travel is expected. Recruiting is being conducted broadly across all technical stacks. If you are a great developer and eager to learn new technologies or platforms, we want to talk to you.Example projects include: developing blockchain based inventory control systems, tracking biological pathogens, reinventing an organization's recruiting platform and process, developing massive IoT telemetry ingestion platforms, and building media delivery platforms for some of the biggest sporting events in the world.You can reach out to me directly by going to https://aka.ms/AppsHnRecruit or you can apply to Microsoft at https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en
                      
                  
      Of all companies, I never expected Microsoft to be remote friendly. Nice.I worked there for a long time as a Senior Developer. I certainly wouldn't call it remote friendly unless you have a manager willing to fight for your ability to work remote.We are hiring for field (consulting, support, tech sales/architecture and some customer facing engineering) positions remotely, with varying degrees of travel. Core engineering teams are still largely on Prem, although Iâ€™ve been delivering software on the consulting side so long Iâ€™m a bit out of touch there.If this is the division I am part of, there are definitely remote friendly roles available.  The nature of the role will impact travel.  My current role balance is about 25% travel, 30-50% coding, the remainder mentoring, design, etc.Any Engineering positions REMOTE?Core engineering, not really, although Xamarin might be an exception. Customer facing engineering, consulting, support engineering, and other field based software dev roles are primarily distributed, with varying degrees of travel. Ive been doing application development in the consulting services wing for quite a while now, so Iâ€™m a bit out of touch with the product engineering groups.United States Digital Service | Senior Software Engineers, Senior Site Reliability Engineers, Senior Designers, and more! | Washington, DC | ONSITE https://www.usds.gov/The best of technology. The best of government. And we want you. We're looking for the most tenacious designers, software engineers, product managers, and more, who are committed to untangling, rewiring and redesigning critical government services. You'll join a team of the most talented technologists from across the private sector and government. No government resume required! We work on some of the biggest issues affecting the American people there are, immigration, veterans service, students, health care, and more. We're especially looking for talented senior engineers to join us to help shift move government tech in the right direction.See one of our Reports to Congress for examples of what you could be working on:https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/07/Apply here:https://www.usds.gov/join
                      
                  
      We've got a lot of impactful projects to work on. It turns out that government systems/technology need a lot of help, and USDS is well-positioned to assist.I applaud you for what you're doing. I also know you've heard this 100 times Matt, but maybe it'll be the 101st time that makes the decisions makers allow this. Allow remote.This country spans a large area & a lot of it is full of people who would love to help their country do better, but few want to move to DC. The US "Digital" Service should be a shining example to others of how to work remotely.
                      
                  
      I hear you. Right now a lot of our meetings involve sitting with or across from decision makers, and being in DC is really critical for that.For what it's worth, some of our individual agency engagements (e.g. VA or DoD) might allow you to come to DC for a short while like three months and then work remotely after that. But most of our work is in DC, at least for now.
                      
                  
      If that was something you promoted for the summer months when school is out & one could bring their family with, I think you would have a lot of takers.Best wishes!
                      
                  
      Just keep senior people there as code reviewers and 'account managers' who would sit down with stakeholders from DC. Then open source some of the other projects or at least add approved citizens that could work remotely on low-security projects. (Like some of the commenters above).Iâ€™ve said it to you before, and Iâ€™ll say it again, thank you for your service Matt. Listened to you on the TWiT network and have followed your career ever since.Iâ€™m on vacation this week, and while my wife reads, I spelunk data in the US Census and American Community Survey. Iâ€™ve been looking this week at polling proximity for voters based on demographics and RUCA coding, to see how fair access is to voting throughout the country. Iâ€™ve had to primarily use third party data sources because the government datasets are poor or non existent (thanks to Census Reporter, Google Civic API, and Google Distance Matrix API).I hope other engineers like yourself take the challenge and seek to improve our technology. We need it, and itâ€™s important!Thanks again Matt.
                      
                  
      It sounds like your current gig would keep you 100% busy, but if timing or life changes might allow for you to come do a tour, it sounds you've been bit by the same civic bug as us!Definitely. Maybe need to get Google to buy my startup and Iâ€™ll go spend a couple years in service :)If Iâ€™m ever in DC Iâ€™ll reach out. Would love to take a tour and learn more.Best of luck to you and the team, Matt. Email is in my profile if I can ever be of assistance.
                      
                  
      Is USDS doing any work with the IRS? I'm currently working at a tax policy think tank, and from what I can see I think the IRS could definitely use help on a number of fronts. Probably the biggest thing: they've got to finish rewriting their tax filing system to not be in assembly--don't know if they've made good progress on getting it into Java. Their SOI data could also use a better system for hosting/distribution along the lines of data.gov.We have done some work with the IRS in the past, such as https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/irs-secure-acce...We don't currently have an engagement at the IRS/Treasury, but if we get more people to sign up, that would increase the odds. :)
                      
                  
      Just FYI the IRS is hiring directly. I keep seeing them advertising open software engineering positions in Austin, TX, though I'm uncertain about other locations.Are you Libertarian or do you have a non-partisan objection to the IRS specifically?In my experience, "starving the beast" just means you're locked in a room with a starving beast. Bureaucracies can be awful to deal with. But if you strip them of resources, the laws that dictate their mission are unchanged. Any hope of expedient resolution of issues is gone. People who, often through no choice of their own, must deal with these bureaucracies will receive worst treatment and outcomes. Unpopular though the IRS may be, an IRS that can't function correctly is more dangerous to individuals and society than one that can.I'm struggling to think of any legitimate objection to the IRS that could be non-partisan.It's always been my daydream to work with a company like this and serve my country.At my current job I joined because it directly helps people as well by helping them shed off debt they cannot handle. We all do what we can to help others. Kudos to you!
                      
                  
      That's important! We have done some work on that around student loans: https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/what-if-you-could...If you're interested, consider applying!
                      
                  
      It's too bad that there aren't intern positions. Lots of DC students would be interested I'm sure.You might want to check out https://www.fedscoop.com/civic-digital-fellows-demo-day-2018... if you're looking for that!Any nontechnical roles ever come up? I'm at the e-Residency program in Estonia leading a team but definitely want to come back to the States and serve at some pointMost of our work involves engineers, designers, and product managers. Under the product category, there's also the notion of a "bureaucracy hacker" who helps get things done and launched. Those folks might not always be super technical, but are good at pushing to make forward progress.I am impressed with the work your team is doing!Has the current administration changed the work/mission/culture at all?We work on non-partisan projects, and the way we prioritize projects hasn't changed. So we're still able to get important things done for Veterans, small businesses, doctors/patients, students, immigrants, soldiers, etc.This is a recent overview of the sort of projects that we're working on: https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/fall/ It's all great stuff that you'd feel proud to tell your family and friends about.
                      
                  
      > We work on non-partisan projectsAs the existence and prioritization of executive branch projects is an outcome of partisan politics, that's only even possibly true in the sense that some government projects, even in this administration, aren't particularly subject to partisan controversy.But while it would be possibly true in that sense, it doesn't seem to be actually true in that sense, as a review of the highlight projects at https://www.usds.gov/work shows that many serve goals that have been the subject of intense partisan controversy over the last couple years.
                      
                  
      This is interesting. Iâ€™m a veteran and know first hand how terrible the system can be.Iâ€™ve taight myself JavaScript and have recently learned Django with my current position. I donâ€™t have any plans to leave the company now, but working on systems that can help out fellow veterans more easily is tempting.Maybe in a year or two Iâ€™ll revisit this :)
                      
                  
      You might consider applying. We're well-positioned to improve things at Veterans Affairs. I've had a Veteran say "I had trouble deciding about my GI Bill benefits. I'd like to build a tool to make it easier for other Veterans." And then they did!Check out this GI Bill comparison tool that Marc (the Veteran I mentioned) built: https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/ . Seeing vets help out brothers and sisters who have served is really inspiring.

      Renaissance Technologies | Java and Kotlin full stack developers | NYC | Onsite, Full-timehttps://www.rentec.com/  The worlds most successful hedge fund.Looking for developers to contribute to back office functionality, for essentially everything after the trade is made.   We generally run Linux/JVM/Postgresql stack with an ongoing switch to Kotlin.   Been in business for 30 years.  We are stable and profitable.    Resumes to careers@rentec.comMust have college degree with high GPA in math, physics, computer science or related fields.   We typically desire many years of experience, but will consider recent graduates if the match is very strong.
                      
                  
      I have to say, I never imagined I'd see the day RenTec came into an HN Who's Hiring thread.Is this role in your NYC or Long Island facility? It doesn't seem to be reflected on your careers page.
                      
                  
      I wasn't planning on making the submission, but it just happened that the "Who's Hiring" thread was on the top of the page.    The truth is that it is difficult to find top talent for any organization.    The economy is booming, and we're competing with more firms.   As we all know: "Software is Eating the World".This role could be in either location, but I expect it will be filled in our NYC offices.We're no different than any other technology based firm.
                      
                  
      For what it's worth, I emailed careers@rentec.com about this position and I was told they're only hiring for positions on their website. Do you mind clarifying that a bit? Does this role map to one of the positions on the careers page?Any resume sent to careers@rentec.com will be entered into our system and be seen by one of the tech managers (which includes me).   If you don't mind my asking, when did you contact the firm?   I will speak with the people who process the received resumes to not discourage people from making submissions.The open position here most closely matches to the "Financial Infrastructure Programming" position.

      Beckman Coulter Life Sciences | JavaScript or C# Engineers | SW Oregon | Full-time | OnsiteBC makes actual hardware products.  This group makes boxes that sniff air and tell you how clean it is.  Useful for microchip makers and especially drug companies.Weâ€™re not a startup, which means you donâ€™t have to deal with 20-something hotshots who have something to prove, all the while writing code for products that nobody will ever want.  We donâ€™t work 12-hour days while pretending to have unlimited personal time.  Itâ€™s a mature company that treats its employees with respect and pays them well.  And it makes actual stuff that gets built and shipped out the door.It also wants to stay relevant with the latest technologies and needs your skills to keep up with the workload.  We have 14 openings right now.  The average employee here is probably over 35, and over a decade of service.Salary range?  Iâ€™m getting paid more here than I ever did in California, and my annual take-home starts with a 2.  You donâ€™t have to take a pay cut to move here.  And holy @#$% does it go far.Imagine, living in a small city with a surprising array of big-city amenities, beautiful mountains everywhere, where almost everyoneâ€™s nice, most men wear beards, and you can afford a house with a yard on a single income.  Maybe like the town you grew up in.  Weâ€™re 4 hours from Portland, so donâ€™t worry about getting too much of that scene unless you want to.After grinding it out in the SF bay area dystopia for years, I felt like Iâ€™d died and gone to heaven when I took this job.  If you do well on your resume and phone screen, BC will fly you out for a daylong onsite, which is really useful if youâ€™re on your last dime after getting sucked dry by California rents.  How about leaving that scene behind?We want talent, and we don't get hung up on irrelevant details.  Email me at <username>@beckman.com.

They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasnâ€™t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with.

      35k in a city with a ~40% tax rate and rents approaching 2k/month.Developer salaries in Europe are a joke.
                      
                  
      There are a lot of really low-ball offers, but there is also a shortage of talented applicants, so you can find some stuff around for â‚¬140K or â‚¬85-110 / hour.You also don't need a car, work reasonable hours and get twice the vacation.
                      
                  
      Actually though. This is awful. I loved Amsterdam, but I can't imagine why anyone would stay in Europe when even new grads can make >= 4x that in the US.35k is low even for straight out of university. With a few years of experience itâ€™s closer to 50-70kâ‚¬ (57-80k$)That said, when I was doing the math on moving to the states, a +80% increase in salary still left me with less money in NYC vs Amsterdam. (I have kids: healthcare + kids education + rent basically wipes out your income in the US, it doesnâ€™t in Amsterdam)
                      
                  
      Yup, and when your kids will go to uni you'll be paying 2.000 euro/year for TU Delft instead of 40.000 for MIT.Well one of the reasons (and it's a dumb one), is that getting a US work Visa is almost impossible for most, so they don't really have a choice, unfortunately.Problem is it's impossible to get a US work visa :)That is not a regular salary in the Netherlands, they are just being cheap. My first job paid 40k, in a cheaper city, 10 years ago without a university degree.Tax brackets are progressive, with 35k you pay about 20% income tax. Expats get a 30% income tax discount for 5 years.While salaries are low, it does have some advantages to live here. Strong  employee protection (you can't get fired for example), paid leave (minimum is 20 days + public holidays), you don't work more than 40h/week, cheap healthcare, good infrastructure and public transport, paid sick/disability, unemployment benefit, welfare, state pension, etc.It is hard to compare employment salaries. I think it makes more sense to compare freelance wages as they don't have those benefits. Freelance engineers make about 80~100 euro/hour and get some tax discount.
                      
                  
      I paid 32% on 36k (my first job as a junior dev). But I had no ruling because I studied there for 6 months.Agree with everything else. Netherlands is a great country.
                      
                  
      I think you are mixing up the tax bracket with the total income tax you payed. With 36k you should pay approximately 25%.

      OpenMessage | Senior Software Engineers | https://openmessage.io | NYC | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE if willing to relocate to NYC | $90-$130k + 0.1-2.5%Hello fellow engineers and future teammates,We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services. Being able to fuse realistic human-like conversation design ("character") and NLP/ML with the ubiquity of SMS/MMS (and RCS/Business Chat soon) is why I personally get out of bed in the morning as an engineer at OM.It's also nice that goal-oriented conversations are like little conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our prioritization and decision making so there is a lot of interesting and impactful stuff to do there.If you're into massive scaling and operations, we are currently humming along at hundreds of messages per second and have a roadmap to get to millions in the next few months. We need your help to get there.For the design-inclined, one of our major features is the conversational composer frontend with previews/canvas drawing etc. that will evolve according to what the messaging channels can support in terms of content types and interaction. Messages are personalized in different ways.We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy as well. No jerks or brogrammers, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!There is a small code challenge that checks for data manipulation techniques. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding. Existing open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!
