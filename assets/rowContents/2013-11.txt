Matasano - New York City, Chicago, San Francisco Bay AreaWe test software for vulnerabilities.Sorry, that's too clinical - the reality is that we torture and flay software, twisting it to serve our nefarious ends.If that sounds like fun, consider applying.NO PRIOR APPSEC EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED. Just a keen technical acumen and a thirst for blood.Perks: crazy-smart coworkers, health benefits, free books, etc. For more information, visit http://www.matasano.com/careers/FEED YOUR HEAD:As a bonus, try your hand at this problem from our never-before-published set of crypto challenges: https://gist.github.com/sdevlin/52e1d8898bda7ad35567It's not required, but writing code to solve this problem would be a good way to get our attention. For more information on the crypto challenges, visit http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/
                      
                  
      If you've only seen the first set of our crypto challenges (you have to finish the first 8 problems before you get the next set), and you're wondering what the remaining 56 (soon to be 64) problems are like, the crypto challenge Sean just posted is much more representative of the whole than anything in set 1.We use set 1 primarily to weed out people who aren't serious about writing code.
                      
                  
      I sent the email to request the first set of challenges on 10/21 but never heard back
                      
                  
      If I've submitted solutions (or what I thought was solutions...) for the first 8 problems, and I don't hear back, does that mean I need to keep working on it? I did submit code.
                      
                  
      We're extremely backed up, mostly because of Mail 7. We'll clear out the backlog this weekend, and, moving forward, we're sending challenges out 2 sets at a time.
                      
                  
      Thanks so much! Sorry for being anxious :\
                      
                  
      I emailed a few months asking about an internship in Chicago but got no response. Are there spots open for interns?
                      
                  
      I'm working on that one right now. My solution will work but it seems very slow and painstaking - is there an insight I'm missing that will make for a more elegant algorithm?

      > - You believe the actor-model concurrency is a better idea.Better than using stateful concurrency? If you have read "Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming" you would see that each approach is not necessarily "better", they each have their own unique advantages and disadvantagesTo quote from CTM:
    The message-passing approach is often the 
best for multi-agent programs, i.e., programs that consist of autonomous entities
(â€œagentsâ€�) that communicate with each other. The shared-state approach is often
the best for data-centered programs, i.e., programs that consist of a large repository
of data (â€œdatabaseâ€�) that is accessed and updated concurrently. Both approaches
can be used together for different parts of the same application.

      Are you concerned at all that your job posting may be unnecessarily gendered? I understand that lots of people enjoy board games and beer, but in America they have a lot of strong associations with male-only culture.
                      
                  
      If you would've clicked through and seen that one of the co-founders was female, maybe we could've avoided this comment.
                      
                  
      I did click through before I wrote it. It looked like the 'programmer' side of the business was entirely male. That doesn't really mean anything- there's not enough female programmers to go around- but it didn't assuage any of my worries about the post.I might be a little sensitive though. Before I read that, I  had just sent the thread to a woman I know who is looking for a new job, and her immediate reaction was "I don't want to work with brogrammers."
                      
                  
      How am I supposed to play Settlers with you if I'm remote?

      Oakland, CA - Director of Engineering at Geospatial StartupVehicle Data Science Corporation is looking for a Director of Engineering to lead design and implementation of software that processes and analyzes big spatial data sets. The company is an early-stage startup located in Oaklandâ€™s Rockridge neighborhood with initial funding from a National Science Foundation grant and a major automobile client. We use location data from vehicles to derive driving behaviors which we capture in a proprietary database. This database feeds applications in the areas of driver safety, fuel economy and autonomous vehicles.We are looking for a smart, adaptable individual with plenty of skills and breadth in computing to build products from our data streams. By joining us today, you get a unique chance to engineer new technology from the ground up. Working in tandem with the companyâ€™s CTO, you will tackle both back end infrastructure and a web front end. Initially, the position will primarily involve hands-on coding and systems administration, but it can evolve toward more supervision and/or architectural work as we grow, based on your inclinations.Our current systems are built 100% in Python, with a PostGIS database in the back end. Our roadmap includes two key tasks that the Director of Engineering must be equipped to lead:
* Take the back end to the next level by splitting it into multiple databases that each fulfill a specific purpose, and shard our primary data warehouse so it can handle tens of terabytes. The choice of technologies is still to be determined, so a broad range of experience with distributed systems and nosql databases is desirable;

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and want to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.

      Statwing - San Francisco (Mission District)We love analyzing data. We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. So weâ€™re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and experts can get their insight much faster.Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but existing software requires an unnecessarily large amount of statistical knowledge to ask simple questions. And even experts find these tools time-consuming and painful to use. So most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface thatâ€™s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term "Data Science", built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).We're hiring.

      NYC Full-time hires - DramaFever
http://www.dramafever.com/company/#/careersDramaFever is a young, ambitious and rapidly growing online video start-up that specializes in international entertainment.  The company was founded in 2009 and   initially focused on content from Asia, but has recently expanded into providing Spanish language programming as well.  Partners include Hulu.DramaFever's engineering team is currently seeking Full Stack and Back-end Developers (Python, Go, Django, Redis, AWS), Linux sysadmins, Devops pros, and Android developers.Technology decisions are made for the right reasons at DramaFever, recognizing that sometimes right includes "what would be most interesting" -- our image processors and some analytics pieces are now Go.  We've got a mandate to be "available everywhere", which means we're on or soon to be on every major mobile OS and every home theater platform.The backend stack is ever evolving with new services and tools being added all the time.  We use a 3rd party service when it's cost efficient and sufficiently flexible and build stand-alone in house services when that makes the most sense.  Our level of automation is quite high with chef+vagrant and per-dev micro-instances for development, Jenkins built docker containers for deployments, and autoscaling in place for all production services.Our development practices are always being refined -- last week we eliminated timesheets. We spec in google docs, keep code and issues in Github, and review (all) code in pull requests.  IRC is for engineering battlestations or deciding from where we'll order lunch.  Pick your own editor, OS, browser, and tooling so long as you know how to configure its whitespace settings.

Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.We are changing that. We use our location-based technology to automatically match supply and demand.If you're ready to transform the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to jobs@intrans.com.

      Square â€” NYC https://squareup.com/ ---Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.As a company, we have four main focuses.Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were "non-consumers" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (http://squareup.com/market) and Square Cash (http://squareup.com/cash), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute and receive a lot of backing and support from the institute and their extended network.Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers.

    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world

Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.The founding team consists of recent University of Cambridge graduates and a director at the Max-Planck Institute. In the past months we have also been joined by two excellent engineers.
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way.We are looking to hire one additional engineer, and are in the lucky position where we can afford to be picky with whom we choose. 
Our team is distributed, and we would therefore expect you to work remotely as well. We would prefer if you were located within one or two timezones of our own (UTC+2). We offer good and stable salary, generous equity, exciting problems to solve, and a fabulous team, and in turn expect you to be driven, social, and good at solving problems.We hope to hear from you.

      Parse.ly - Remote Work in or near Eastern Timezone (EST) -- http://parse.ly---We're a fully distributed team (see http://bit.ly/distributed-teams for a post by me, the CTO) -- which is to say, a merit-based, technology-forward, super-bright team of Pythonistas who happen to collaborate using the same methods of major open web projects like Wikipedia, Wordpress, Ubuntu, and Mozilla.We just closed a $5M series A round. As a result, we're looking to expand our engineering team. We are looking for full-stack engineers and senior engineers, especially focused on our backend analytics technology.Experience with high write performance DBs (e.g. Redis, Cassandra), large-scale log analysis (e.g. Hadoop, Pig, Hive), and big distributed cloud systems (e.g. >20 node cloud deployments) will mean you'll hit the ground running here.You'd be joining the company at a great time. Our engineering team is still small enough that we feel like an elite task force, but unlike two years ago, we are making millions in revenue and have a ridiculous amount of data to draw insight out of on behalf of our customers.You should be an expert in a mainstream programming language, preferably Python or JavaScript. You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Postgres, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.Also, if you happen to be an experienced software engineer who wants to end up in a role with a mixture of product management, customer interaction, and individual contributions to the code, we have just the position for you. Let us know -- we're looking for you. But we're also looking for DevOps candidates to help us manage our systems and great backend engineers to help us build a powerful and robust analytics system for our customers and the high-performance APIs they depend upon.If you join us, you'll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media. Our software aggregates data on over 5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.Get in touch with us directly at hello@parsely.com if you are interested -- mention HN and ask for Andrew.

      It is interesting that you are going from Java --> Rails rather than the other way around.
                      
                  
      It's actually more of a move away from MySQL -> Mongo, than Java to RailsAll of our other apps are on a Rails/Mongo stack. Most of our dev team is Rails and figured it'd be easier to hire Senior Rails hackers than Java folks.
                      
                  
      That's what I was thinking. Or at least not Java to Scala.
                      
                  
      Ditto, did you consider Java to Javascript? It may make sense to you given that you are using AngularJS on the front-end as well as for consolidating skills.I am a Ruby/Rails dev that switched to using Clojure and Node.js, depending on the use cases. I wouldn't want to use Ruby for anything else than static sites and tooling now.
Some people think that Javascript is a gimmick, but is it vastly superior to Ruby when it comes to concurrency, ability to share back-end and front-end code, and the tools have gotten really good too.PS: I wouldn't necessarily recommend switching from Java to Scala, the benefits may be low or negative for most people, see Yammer's experience: http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/11/yammer-scala
                      
                  
      I actually joined about a year ago and the decision had already been made to use Rails to run our API and server-side code.We have 4 different apps; one of the major ones is already using Rails/EventMachine to power it and we've learned how to scale it.I'm not sure why Node.js wasn't seriously considered for this rewrite, but if I had to guess, it's because we didn't want to take the time to learn a new thing, we've got a legacy system that badly needs customers migrated off it, and shipping something soon is paramount.I'm sure at some later date, we'll move all our stuff to JS. It seems inevitable with the way things are currently headed.

      Software developer, Stat.io - Cambridge UK, or REMOTEStat.io is building a web application that lets people use open data to improve decision-making. Our vision is to aggregate data from hundreds of open data portals, which can then be accessed in one place. You can see a very early demo of the application over here:http://www.stat.io/dev/The challenge is to understand millions of datasets from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and then provide an interface that allows users to find the data they're interested in.The main technologies we're using for data processing are Python and MySQL, with a bit of Redis and MongoDB for some simple queueing and logging respectively. We're open to using any technologies if it helps get us closer to our vision. For instance, there's a good chance that alternative data stores to MySQL would be a better fit for the problems we face.We're looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time. If you're interested or have any questions, get in touch: contact@stat.io.You can find out more about us on our website: http://www.stat.io/

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why youâ€™re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

      MapQuest is hiring. We're working on a variety of things besides getting people directions from A to B, and we are trying to do that with a minimum of drama and a maximum of excitement. Our headquarters is in downtown Denver, CO, but we have people working in NYC, Pennsylvania, Washington, DC and even England as well. We're #2 in the maps and directions industry behind Google, and are amidst a pivot out of maps and directions and into travel. We try to combine a startup's level of passion and creativity with bigco backing and an audience of 40M UV's monthly. You can see products we've released recently at http://discover.mapquest.com and http://travelblogs.mapquest.com, and there is more coming soon.We have open reqs for Javascript developers, Rails developers and Mobile developers (Android, iOS and Windows). While experienced engineers are certainly welcome, we have a strong pairing culture in Denver and have had outstanding success with entry-level engineers over the past six months. If you've got some talent with web development, have a github profile and don't mind booger jokes, we'd love to talk. We have an online coding test at http://www.interviewzen.com/apply/3QPLHn that shouldn't take much more than 10 minutes.I could post the official reqs here, but essentially, we're looking for people who are smart and comfortable doing a variety of things. We have web-based products written in Scala, Node.js, Rails, Java and even some C out there, and while we don't expect anyone to be fluent in all of them, we look for people who are willing to be flexible and excited at the chance to stretch themselves.If you're interested, please give me a buzz - my e-mail is in my profile. I'd love to chat.

      Likeable Local - Portland, Maine - Social Media Tools for Small Businesseshttp://www.likeablelocal.com/We at Likeable Local are looking to grow our team and seeking two talented 
and motivated software engineers.  One immediate role would be perfect for 
someone who is great with numbers and analytics.  The other role is better suited
towards someone who loves working in the front-end and loves making things 
look and interact beautifully- with html, javascript, and css.  In both cases the 
engineers should love building cool things, learning, and social media.  We are 
in Portland, Maine which is atypical for Hacker News, but is a great place to live!  
We aren't looking for remote workers at this time.We are a tech-startup-spinoff of the award-winning (NYC-based) agency Likeable 
Media, and we are looking for people that are willing to jump right in and be on 
our small team (currently 3 other full-time developers) creating features that will 
be visible and impactful and used immediately.We are hard-working and smart, and we love to solve challenging problems.  
We use a lot of node.js, javascript, python, django, and the Oxford comma.You love being a substantial contributor and are interested in the â€œfull stackâ€� of 
technologies from details of server configuration, back-end, front-end, and mobile 
platforms.  You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your 
communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.Likeable Local offers an integrated software solution that allows small businesses 
to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was 
founded in 2012 and has a deployed product that integrates with Facebook and 
Twitter. The software is sold on a subscription basis, allowing for attractive recurring 
revenue economics, and is in use by dentists, dry cleaners, florists, and jewelers 
and we continue to expand.Interested?  Email me at hugh@likeable.com and lets connect!
                      
                  
      Just to provide a second point of reference, I'm a relatively recent dev hire at Likeable Local and it's been a really good choice for me. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, as well, so feel free to reach out to me.
                      
                  
      I've always thought Portland, ME was an incredible city.  Just curious - what made you choose there (especially coming from NYC)?
What is the tech scene like?
                      
                  
      Hey!  We love it here.  I chose it for family reasons initially but am happily settled in.  We've found a fun talented and creative community at http://www.thinktankportland.com/ .  There are pros and cons for sure.  It's easy to get to NYC (just about an hour flight and the local airport is a breeze to use).  But not as easy to get to SF (sadly no direct flights).  We've got affordable housing, some good school systems, access to nature and the ocean and the beautiful maine coast, islands, amazing summers, lots of great people, and hardly any traffic at all.Access to talent may not be as plentiful here as elsewhere but in a smaller world it is also easier to be found by prospective hires.  If anyone out there is searching for software development jobs here in Portland, Maine they should be able to find us- although we've got lots of work to do there...  But anyway, if you're interested in learning more about this area let me know what else I can tell you!
