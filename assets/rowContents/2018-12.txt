      Is it a legal requirement to your partners in govt / LE that you only hire US candidates or just timezone issues?I was introduced to Thorn by Ori Eisen when I worked for him (one of the best CTOs I've ever met) and was very impressed by the technical challenges and their real world application.Always wanted to stay involved after I left 41st / Experian; you guys are the real deal in terms of using data for good.
                      
                  
      My understanding as a software engineer: It's more of a logistical thing than a legal requirement I believe - we're a small team, so expanding into new regions brings additional overhead for the organization.  That said I believe we do want to expand beyond the US in the future, so if you're interested in that sort of thing, let me find out how you can get on a mailing list to be notified when we're set up to hire in a new region.Can I get an email address?

      Orbit | San Francisco, CA | Full Time | Full stack / Frontend | https://tryorbit.com/"We're" basically me. If you want to do the startup jig this is about as good as it gets -- a cornucopia of interesting tech and a fresh approach to an old problem. Big problems to solve, huge areas of control over the future, and good equity.The website shows almost a year-old version of the product/pitch, it's come quite far since then. The pitch is a knowledge app platform that runs entirely on device, with great search, and which learns your company vocabulary and profiles of everyone with who is good at what. Our "secret" is an augmented system for actually understanding your screen at all times and showing augmented information/updates inline, anywhere you are.Combine state of the art on-device NLP, a novel OCR system that scans a dense screen of text in <250ms, and a years in the making UI/app system that is wholly unique, and you're at a very interesting crossroads.What I need is one great developer who leans towards Frontend and React. But ideally loves moving between front and back, is motivated by tackling big problems and building a truly incredible product/experience, and is willing to sacrifice some salary for equity (the typical startup pitch). But the nice part is -- we have the best investors (Founders Fund), it's very close to launch, and the problems we're solving are absolutely engaging.I need someone in SF. I've tried remote, but for something this early it just needs to be in-person.Reach out to me, natewienert /at/ gmail.com

      Hello joshmaker,I read your new post for Python Web developer at Atlantic Media in the DC area while job searching here on hackernews. Well, I checked out the Atlantic media site and they have a opening available listed on there for a Back-end Python Developer. I'm guessing that they are the same opening.So, I see that you work for Atlantic Media. Don't know if that still holds up but I wanted to check if the Python Web Developer job is available for someone experienced or can it be available for a Junior position?I'm a guy who has been going the self-taught route where I enjoy using and working with Python as far as learning purposes go. And after quickly reading your post here I figured to reach out and try a somewhat different approach rather than the old cover letter and resume email method and contact you if you may have any info to this current opening at your company?So with that said, here I am..and I wanted to inquire to find out if the listed job requirements are strictly enforced or would you allow other considerations in place of some of the listed job requirements?Plus, do you have a contact email to learn more about this position and the things you require in regards to the nature of the job? My apologies in advance that this may not be the response to your post that you were looking for but I figured why not take a chance and try something different to reach out and learn what I can do to improve my chances to be part of the Atlantic media team.Any help in this matter will be greatly appreciated. Thanks--K

We offer significant equity, full benefits, and all the usual startup perks.This role is based in San Francisco, but remote is optional if you have significant work history of successful remote work. https://jobs.lever.co/pachyderm/Qualifications:* 2+ years of experience working in distributed systems, data infrastructure, back-end systems or related development work. â€¨* Major contribution to prominent and related open-source projects are a plus or can be a replacement for work experience in some circumstances (e.g. Youâ€™ve been a student just finishing your degree)â€¨* While it is a bonus, experience with Golang is not a strict requirement. Programming languages are tools in your tool belt and weâ€™ve found that great engineers have no problem learning new tools.
