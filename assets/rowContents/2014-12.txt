Harvard University - Cambridge MA / Greater Boston AreaThis is a somewhat strange job offer, it will not be like most other jobs posted here.I am looking for someone to replace me as a researcher in Jennifer Lewis' 3D printing lab[0] at Harvard. Jennifer is a world leader in 3D printing of novel materials, and her lab has some of the most precise 3D printers in the world.You will be the only software developer in the group, and will be responsible for designing tools that keep the printers running, tools that make other researchers designs easier to implement, tools that automate the printing process, and in general any tools you think would make the lab more efficient. You will be a part of world class research, and your work will directly effect the process.You need to be a incredibly self directed person, as you will be the only software developer in the lab. Passion for 3D printing and the ability to work directly with the end users of your software are a must. Experience designing GUIs is preferred.Most of the tools I've built up are in python, so experience there would be a plus. For an example of tools you would be working on, see this github repo:https://github.com/jminardi/mecodeFor more information contact me at jack @ minardi . org[0]: http://lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu
                      
                  
      I knew this group when they were at UIUC. Their work is really great and approachable. the concept of basic version control was foreign to them, so there seemed to be a lot of room for improvement on the non-scientific side. It is great that they have started to fix those issues. Seriously consider this job is you are interesting in the mix between hardware and software.
                      
                  
      I got most people using git now!
                      
                  
      I might work as a developer, but I trained as a 3D animation. I'll have to give this position a look!
                      
                  
      That is absolutely amazing, and really makes me wish I knew a damn thing about 3D printing.
                      
                  
      Plus one for the cool factor!

Position: Front-end dev - Full TimeWe're a small team tackling a very important and challenging healthcare problem: Better communication between team of doctors. Think of it as a bug tracker for doctors.It's hard to believe but doctors are still stuck managing hundreds of patients without proper tools to keep track of critical information. They still use paper to assign tasks between them. In some departments they have an intern walking around with a big whiteboard where they write tasks on it! It's illegal for doctors to use email, whatsap or any other good project management tool because it's not regulatory compliant with patient data. It's also not adapted to their very intense workflow.We're a team of 5, recently done YC and raised a good seed round from excellent investors. More importantly, we're getting amazing excitement from doctors and ListRunner completely replaced their paper patient list.We're looking for a very good front-end developer to join our talented and passionate team.We moving really fast and are looking for someone who likes to move even faster!Please reach me at phzbox @ gmail if you are:- Passionate about web technologies (We use React, Angular, Gulp, and aren't afraid to use the best tool to get

      ECMC Innovation Lab / collegeabacus.org - Washington, D.C.Looking for full stack devs, preferably with rails or angular experience.The ECMC innovation lab was created to originate new products generally relating to ECMC's core business of servicing student loans and also to support the collegeabacus.org app.The office just opened and I just joined as the lead (and currently only) dev here. As we transition to a brand new dev team we'll be doing a bunch of work in support of the collegeabacus.org app, basically building the entire dev ops stack, as well as other feature building. (We are building a big admin tool in angular.)As an innovation office we will also be developing various alpha products and refining the current UX for ECMC's users.The work should offer a nice combination of challenges- some greenfield projects, (hopefully in node.js, or whatever we decide is most suitable) and some fun stuff to do in terms of startup dev (scaling) but none of the problems (user aquisition, runway).We're looking for web dev generalists who have experience with more backend and dev ops type skills or angular and CSS type skills. Smart people without relevant experience will also be considered. No visas, unfortunately.We run a small lean dev team (not > than 7 anytime soon) that will employ modern, sane dev practices: continuous integration, BDD, pairing. Diversity of background and experience is encouraged- I myself am a non-CS programmer. Work week will be a consistent 40 hours.Drop me a message to my profile email if interested!

      Blend | https://blendlabs.com/jobs/ | San Francisco | Software EngineerThe last 10 years saw a massive boom in the US real estate market fueled by troubled loans buyers couldnâ€™t afford. An even larger bust followed, with losses of $2.8 trillion along with the homes of more than 14 million Americans. While the economy has since improved, many processes within the mortgage industry have not. Gains have been made primarily in paperwork and manpower, not technology. Operations remain manual and slow and consumers are not happy.At Blend, we're fixing these problems by replacing the archaic software currently in use at lending institutions with a modern system. We're applying today's data analysis tools and consumer-grade UI/UX to streamline home lending for both borrowers and banks and make the entire process more transparent.Our team of 20 includes engineers formerly at Palantir, Google, Stanford, MIT, CMU, and Caltech, and we're backed by Peter Thiel, Formation 8, Andreessen Horowitz, Max Levchin, and Lightspeed Ventures. Our stack includes NodeJS, Spark, AngularJS, Python, and ElasticSearch.

      NGP VAN - Boston MA or Washington, DC - Software Engineers, DevOps Engineer, Data DevelopersNGP VAN is the worldâ€™s leading political technology firm, providing campaign and organizing technology to Democrats, progressives, and non-partisan organizations. We offer an integrated platform that combines the best fundraising, compliance, organizing, and new media products available. We are a rapidly growing company that built the voter contact and volunteer management tools used by Obama for America. Nearly every State Democratic Party in the country distributes our VoteBuilder tools to Democrats up and down the ticket, and we provide industry-leading organizing tools for labor unions, environmental groups, pro-choice advocates, civil rights activists, and international political parties across the world. Our fundraising and compliance software is used by the vast majority of Democratic candidates from the Presidential level on down, and our fast-growing new media platform has recently become the most-used platform by Democratic campaigns as well.All of the positions in the title are available in either Boston or DC.The positions offers competitive compensation and a strong benefits package. NGP VAN prides itself on being a progressive workplace; we have a fun and inclusive company culture, where we value teamwork, professional development, and work-life balance.  We have your usual tech company perks whether you are a veteran or just getting started in your career, including blowing off steam on a softball field, food and drinks in the office on Fridays while watching team demo videos, generous parental leave, enjoying periodic company retreats to warm places with beaches (just got back from Puerto Rico), and casual Friday every day.Company Site: http://ngpvan.comHit me up at dmiller at ngpvan dot com for more info or to apply.
                      
                  
      Who do you sell to other than the Democrats themselves?  And how do you tend to feel about those with leanings too far left for the Democratic Party?
                      
                  
      We work with a lot of labor organizations and non-profits, as well as progressive international political parties.  As far as our staff goes, the politically active ones tend to be further left than the median Democrat in my estimation, but probably fewer radicals than you might expect.  We also have plenty of folks for whom politics isn't the primary motivation for working here.
                      
                  
      Awesomeness.  I'll probably be in touch, though I have to see about the timing.  Since I'll be available March at the earliest, when is a good time to actually get in contact?

      This is a serious question: are your salaries competitive for that area? Your lead iOS engineers make far less than most staff (entry level) iOS engineers in SF. I ask because my wife and I are thinking of possibly moving to Virginia in a year or so.
                      
                  
      That does not sound competitive for the DC area - lead frontend engineers make $120k+ easily around the area, I find it hard to believe more than $90k can't be offered to an iOS lead.
                      
                  
      There are definitely DC area companies paying those salaries, but they are much more established and well funded (of course) and for seed size companies in the area we are competitive. Note what I mentioned about our team size.Our salaries will rise as we grow past the bootstrap/seed phase.
                      
                  
      Based on the market data we have access to [1] and the other startups we talk with our salaries are in the average range.This area is kind of hurting for mobile talent, but the funding landscape isn't good enough to allow for startups to push SV level salaries unfortunately.[1] http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/ios-developer-salary-SRCH_...

    ## AppNeta - Providence, RI and Boston, MA
    ##   application performance monitoring startup seeks engineers interested
    ##   in making the web faster
    ##

AppNeta is an application performance company that strives to elegantly answer questions about performance that developers and users face each day.  We make TraceView, which enables distributed tracing (like X-Trace, Google Dapper, or Twitter Zipkin) for all major web servers, frameworks, languages, and browsers, and provide a service that collects and analyzes that data to provide beautiful charts, graphs, heatmaps, and request detail that help our customers better understand their application performance in real time.We are currently looking for full-stack and backend-focused engineers who are interested in building innovative performance tools and helping us scale to meet our ever-increasing faucet of customer traffic -- we currently process tens of thousands of events per second.  Our frontend is built with D3.js and Angular, and our backend is almost entirely Python, a bit of C++, MySQL, RabbitMQ, EC2, DynamoDB, Google BigQuery, S3, SQS, Hadoop, Celery, SQLAlchemy, etc.We sit atop mountains of data and strive to provide intelligent, actionable insights for our customers about the performance of their app's code & servers. Processing & visualizing it all at scale is a big challenge, and weâ€™re looking for talented engineers to help us.  We're especially interested in engineers with experience dealing with large amounts of data in Python.TraceView grew out of a Google-Ventures-funded startup called "Tracelytics" and continues as a tight-knit, smart team backed by a strong, growing company that is investing heavily in our product's future.  Our application engineering team is made up of several engineers each in Boston and Providence, with our instrumentation team based in Vancouver.For more info: http://www.appneta.com/about/careers

      Weft - http://weft.io - Cambridge/Boston, MA (office is in central sq.)   ===========================
   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================

We're the single source of truth in logistics data -- we track every boat on the water, every plane in the sky, and every truck on the ground so that we can know everything that's going on in the logistics world. We do a lot of analysis and optimization, too.
Weâ€™re working in the largest, least sexy, most invisible industry in the world â€” 90% of everything has been on a ship at one point in time.The problem -> To try to decrease costs, carries have been increasing the size of container ships. The only problem there is that as container ships get larger, the variability in the global supply chain goes up (e.g. a large ship being late causes a headache to more people than a small one).How we fix it -> We track every ship on the water and run a bunch of analysis on our data sets so that we can help our customers smooth out the rough edges. (One company we're working with spends 6.5 mil every month on â€œlate feesâ€� because of these rough edges).   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================

Web/data stack -> clojure + postgres/cassandra/redis/rabbit + ruby on rails + hadoop/EMR (weâ€™re a SOA shop)Mobile -> iOS, android in the near termAlgorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from CPG companies and telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors (a16z, atlas)!Looking for help on hardware and data science sides! (also looking for experimentalists for fun hedge fund stuff)If this sounds interesting, please shoot us an email at mike@weft.io!

      Hi, We're Fractured Atlas http://www.fracturedatlas.org. We're a non-profit tech company that helps artists make their art while we handle the nitty-gritty.We're badly in need of a UI/UX-type. We have several different tech products and each one has it's own look and feel. As we move along, we'd like the L&F of those products to converge rather than diverge.We need someone to come in and be the authority on this sort of thing. Create a new Bootstrap theme to unify this stuff. Help us understand why this is good and this is bad.You'll have a fair amount of authority and autonomy. Big features start out with prototyping/wireframing and this is where you'll be a big asset. Work with the biz to refine a feature before it hits the devs and becomes a thrashing boondoggle.This position REQUIRES that you be at least familiar with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. We're good at teaching people this stuff (we run a fellowship program that teaches artists to code) but whoever comes in to this position will at least need some foundation to stand on. We'll do our best to train up the rest.We offer all sorts of perks like a fun office, fun people to work with, and a management team that is truly willing to listen to feedback and react. A bunch of other stuff too.NYC-based would be fantastic but a lot of us are remote so that might work too.Email me to get in touch: gary.moore@fracturedatlas.org

      Rakkoon (http://www.rakkoon.com) - Baltimore, MD [REMOTE or LOCAL]We are a startup with a strong mission - helping parents be better parents in a mobile and social world. We want to be a force for good and help parents who are currently struggling. At the same time, we are a business that aims to be around for the long time. We want to be healthy and profitable at a pace that is sustainable.We want the best people, wherever you currently live. We are open to remote candidates or people that want to work in the Baltimore, MD / Washington, DC areas. We are all hard workers, but want people to have thriving personal lives. We want the best performance from people, not the most hours. It's simply not possible to be at your most creative while working too many hours and not having the flexibility you need to live your lives.Rakkoon was founded by three parents with a long history of leadership in successful companies. We know what it takes to create a successful business that treasures its employees. We've found a strong group of investors that believe in our mission and our vision for creating a great company. We would be honored if you would consider working with us.We are looking for technical hire #1 with deep knowledge of networking and HTTP-based APIs who is also enthusiastic about all aspects of developing a consumer-facing product aimed at helping parents in the mobile+social world. We value computer science fundamentals (we will be doing deep packet inspection at scale after all), a strong sense of product design, and enthusiasm for shipping product as part of a small team. Typical tasks will include contributing to our core traffic inspection capability to extract information from network traffic generated by apps on mobile devices, analysis of data (including social network analysis), development of user-facing apps for parents (responsive website for now and moving to iOS and Android Apps soon), and support of the product in a production environment (aka DevOps).Skills we are interested in:
* Strong knowledge of networking (low-level IP, HTTP, and VPNs).
* Strong computer science fundamentals. We will be collecting large amounts of data and doing interesting analysis.
* DevOps experience (Linux definitely - Google Cloud Platform experience is very welcome).
* Our current stack includes Google App Engine (Python / Javascript),  Google Compute Engine (Python), iOS (Objective C - we're tempted by Swift, but not yet!), and Android (Java). As we scale up we will likely add another, higher-performance langue to the backend. Maybe Go, but you can help us make that decision.

      CTO / Founder | EF | LondonWe're a new kind of startup accelerator; investing in top-tier developers pre-idea and pre-team.We bring together the best developers into cohorts where they can find co-founders and get support to help them through the early stages of startup building (figuring out ideas, customer development, fund-raising).We've had two cohorts so far resulting in twenty companies; theyâ€™re currently worth around $100m. Theyâ€™ve raised money from some of the best investors around the world including YC.We're currently focusing on developers who are in the early-stages of their career ranging from recent graduates and PhDs to developers with 4-5 years of real world dev experience. Founders are required to move to London but weâ€™re actively recruiting from across Europe. Weâ€™ve also helped founders sort-out visas in the past when theyâ€™ve needed them.We're especially interested in developers who also have domain expertise that they want to apply to building a startup. Whether thats from academic experience (weâ€™ve had founders turn their doctorates into real world products), personal interest in specific technologies (blockchain, deep-learning, VR, etc.) or from working in a particular field (finance, security, etc).We strongly believe that that we can only succeed by finding the best founders, so if youâ€™re on the fence about applying or have any questions then drop us an email and weâ€™ll help you figure it out.http://www.joinef.com/apply
                      
                  
      Out of interest: why do you set an upper limit of experience on 4-5 years?This way you effectively limit the age at 25-26 (graduating from school at 18, three years to get B.Sc. in CompSci and then the period mentioned).
                      
                  
      The age of leaving uni actually varies quite a bit across Europe, so we get a fair number of applicants above that range.We try to build the cohorts to maximize the number of potential co-founder pairings and part of that means it has to make sense for people to cofound together; i.e. for them to roughly have the same levels of experience.It's also about being able to get the best people. We're very focused on finding exceptional developers, exceptional senior developers are often CTOs or leaders in major companies with strong networks and the ability to easily raise money and build teams without our help.Exceptional junior developers are often still in lower level positions at places like Google or in hedge funds; we're offering them an opportunity to be more than just a cog in the system and that's what we're finding attracts them to us.
                      
                  
      I am also interested to know. Could be because they're (generally) cheaper?
                      
                  
      Generally speaking the developers who apply to us aren't optimizing for salary today; if that's what they want then they'd be much better off working for Google/Facebook/Stripe/etc rather than founding a startup.The amount we invest is enough to cover cost-of-living for the founders so they're able to focus on building their startups (it's roughly similar to other accelerators), but anyone building a startup should appreciate that it'll involve trading-off near-term salary for longer-term gain.

      Optimizely -- San FranciscoWe're especially looking to hire an experienced Dev Ops engineer, but we're always hiring and we'd love to talk to anyone who's at all technical to see if we can find a fit. Check us out! https://www.optimizely.com/jobs?gh_src=fuvi7pAnd here's our blurb:Optimizely was founded by two former Google product managers, Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen. Dan served as the Director of Analytics during the Obama 2008 presidential campaign. While there, his team relied on the use of A/B and multivariate testing to maximize e-mail sign-ups, volunteers, and donations to raise more than $100 million in additional revenue for the campaign.But optimization was hard â€” you needed technical skills and know-how to run even the simplest of tests. After the campaign, Siroker teamed up with Koomen to create a world-class optimization platform that was easy to use in an effort to provide a platform for businesses to be able to conceive and run experiments that helped them make better data-driven decisions.Since completing YCombinator in the winter of 2010, Optimizely has seen strong and growing demand.

We have an existing product that brings in revenue and still has some legs, but our main focus is on a new platform that exists as a virtual appliance (Linux VM) and is composed of (mostly) Erlang and JavaScript... with some Java and Python thrown in there. We sell to the Enterprise (banks, hosting providers, anybody with lots of VMs) and have strong leadership with experience from security, Intelligence orgs, HP, and others; but we still feel like a small company and are a good place for anyone looking to do difficult work on big problems in an environment where results are the only thing that matters.Funded, profitable, and moving quickly; this is the best job I've ever had, and we have a very exciting roadmap ahead of us. If you like independence, Linux, Virtualization, and working with smart people, let us know.All the usuals, casual dress, beer Fridays, flexible hours, etc... we're not a "cushy" startup with ping-pong tables and company outings and all that. Ain't nobody got time for that... we're hustling way too hard, but as we grow I'm sure all that will change. Come here if you want to work really hard to get a product into the market, because there's lots of really hard work to be done around these parts.

      San Francisco and REMOTE | AtlassianWe make JIRA, HipChat and other developer tools that you may know. We're growing our developer relations practice and have a few developer evangelist positions open right now.As a developer evangelist at Atlassian you don't have sales targets or time in a briefing center, and you don't do Powerpoint - instead you spend half of your time building modern web code (pick your language, pick your stack) and half of your time writing and talking about what you did. And you can travel as much or as little as you'd like.In short you get to build cool shit and showcase what's possible by example. Our company is still growing fast after more than 10 years, and our culture is innovative and inclusive.Here's two to start:https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/jobs/listing?org=A...https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/jobs/listing?org=A...
                      
                  
      I don't see any jobs listed that are specifically remote. To apply as a remote developer evangelist, would one need to simply apply for, say, the SF one?
                      
                  
      Yes. Our Taleo system doesn't have Remote as an option but I'm very happy to talk with remote candidates and in fact my dev rel team right now is 100% remote.
                      
                  
      Is the remote option available also for Engineering positions?
                      
                  
      That's going to depend on the role, the hiring manager, and the candidate. I can't answer for all those but I'd suggest it's always worth a conversation if you see a role you find really compelling.

      Baltimore, MD; Reston, VA; FULL TIMEVideology Group - http://www.videologygroup.com/Internet advertising startup looking primarily for server-side Java developers (if your Java is rusty but you're good, drop us a note anyway).  I was working for a start-up called LucidMedia Networks (hence the "lmn" in the e-mail address below), which got acquired by Videology.  Our stack is Java on Spring on *nix with MySQL and some NoSQL stores on AWS.  The Baltimore office also has a team on a large .NET stack as well, but Java teams are spread across both offices.  We have some big projects in the works involving big data and volume as we scale globally and across mediums (video, mobile, etc.).  Currently, our Reston platform alone handles 4 billion requests a day.Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com.I actually got hired through a HN "Who is Hiring" thread, and I hired 2 people through these threads. These things do work!
                      
                  
      Docker - San Francisco
I'm hoping people are somewhat familiar with Docker... but if not:
At Docker Inc, we believe that containerization is the next big thing, the tool which will be part of every developer and sysadmin toolbox. What's "containerization"? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as "Lightweight Virtualization".That's why we recently launched Docker (http://www.docker.com/) & Docker Hub (http://hub.docker.com), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily & a community Hub for the community to organize, share and create images publicly as well as privately. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (https://github.com/docker/docker) and have a look at the code. Not convinced? Then check the website (http://www.docker.com/), which contains more details, demos, and screencasts. Excited about this? Then join our engineering team!We're hiring for:
- Python (Django, Flask, Twisted, etc.) Web Engineers
- Go (golang) 
- FE (javascript, ideally react.js)
- Security EngineeringAs well as many other positions. If you think  you'd be a great fit for Docker, I'd love to check out your profile.
