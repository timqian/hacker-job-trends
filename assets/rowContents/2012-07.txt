      New York / London - Bloomberghttp://www.openbloomberg.com/jobs
http://www.bloomberg.com/uxThere are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R&D. We do a huge variety of things and we like to run our teams with a startup results-driven feel.We are primary consumers of billions of incoming pieces of data daily and redistribute it to over 180 countries on one of the largest private networks in the world, producing software which provides discovery, analytics, visualization and much more.Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com.If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I'll be at GothamJS and dotJS later this year. Also, Matt Turck @ Bloomberg Ventures runs the NY Data Business Meetup at our offices every month and I'm almost always there.
                      
                  
      Bloomberg is a big company; you should know that this gig at BB is the real deal. Andrew and his team get absurdly fun projects working with data at a volume and of an importance very few startups ever get to touch. They're like the Google of money. Also, I worked with Andrew at a startup we did in '00 and would easily put him on my top 5 people I'd want to work with again.If you're debating reaching out about this role: DO IT.
                      
                  
      Good place to work, if being a maintenance programmer for a monopoly with a massive enterprise-quality codebase is your thing.  It's _very_ different from working at a start-up, but probably one of the better places to work in the finance world.
                      
                  
      I can't speak to the whole of Bloomberg, but Infrastructure R&D is very different from Bloomberg at large. Bloomberg does indeed employ an army of people to write and rewrite financial/enterprise line-of-business applications on their terminal platform.This role isn't that.The difference here is akin to the difference between being an ASP.NET web developer at an insurance firm (boring job) and being on the Windows kernel team (not boring job).One thing you'd really want to understand about Bloomberg: unlike most companies in finance, regardless of how much OCaml or Haskell they're allegedly using, Bloomberg is a technology firm. Enterprise/line-of-business development jobs have a bad reputation in large part because they are hosted by companies that aren't about technology. That's not BB. Yes, BB deals in quotes and market data where Google deals in web pages... but the distinctions start to end not far past that.Andrew can do a better job talking up the role than I can; I just know a couple people who work in his group, have heard the war stories, and it's really pretty awesome.
                      
                  
      I can't say it strongly enough, but the ability to be one of the diminishing few with a high ability to understand, debug and fix, large Visual C++ codebases, will likely provide you with a long career.Not all of it is going to be rewritten in .NET, and every year, more of the C++ guys die or retire, and more people quit for .NET, or something easier.Maintenance may be a dirty word in some circles, but for me it's more like an endless confusing puzzle, and stream of opportunities to make things better.

      Los Gatos, CA, NetflixWe have a ton of jobs open, but I'm particularly looking for Site Reliability Engineers.  After yesterday's Amazon outage, you can see we still have some work to do.Looking for someone who can code who also has experience driving unix.  At the interview we ask you to code on the whiteboard and also tell us how to troubleshoot Linux.Netflix is an awesome place to work with lots of smart people and top of market pay (and free movies!).http://jobs.netflix.com/jobsListing.html?id=oHxbWfw5
                      
                  
      To tack on more Netflix openings, drop me a line if you're a UI engineer interested in working in our TV platforms group. As has been discussed before, Netflix delivers UI to TVs, game consoles, blu ray players, and other devices via custom web applications.  We're looking for more very strong JavaScript / HTML UI engineers with an eye for user experience.We have similar openings in our Mobile / Tablet group and working on the website if TV doesn't suit your fancy.  Great team, fun people, great pay.http://jobs.netflix.com/jobsListing.html?id=orV9Wfwb
                      
                  
      Out of curiousity, I was chatting over email with AdrianC some time ago about getting netflix into hospital patient rooms. He said "we will never do a commercial/aggregate account" -- is this still true?I design hospitals and other large enterprise facility's networks and systems... and this is a really big need.Can I talk to someone at netflix and convince them this is a good idea?If not, is it allowable to build a system which has paid netflix streaming accounts that can be "checked-out" by nodes/devices to stream to? Allowing a hospital to have a pool of (N) accounts that can by used by (X) devices?
                      
                  
      Would someone like myself, who is very strong with JavaScript but not a very good eye for design be a fit for this position?
                      
                  
      Most likely, yes. I didn't mean to imply that you needed the skills of a designers; however, we do expect that our engineers will recognize when designs aren't translating particularly well into the finished product (for whatever reason) and be able to work with the design team to fashion alternative approaches.

      META QUESTION,How hard has it been for you to hire? Curious developer seeks more anecdotes to complement pet theories regarding current labour market.
                      
                  
      It is extraordinarily difficult to hire in my field.What more can I tell you?(We're always hiring: http://www.matasano.com/careers --- we love talking to devs from HN.)
                      
                  
      Don't suppose Matasano's looking for a Polish outpost? ;)Should I ever end up in the States, like it or not, I will be beating down your door just for the chance of an interview.
                      
                  
      Hey, sorry it took so long to respond.We've got three offices --- Chicago, NYC, and SFBA (they're all about the same size). It took a long time to decide to open SFBA; we grow slowly.Oddly enough, if we were going to open up in Europe, Poland would be among the first places we'd consider. It's a bit of a hotbed for appsec talent.
                      
                  
      Hehe, no need to apologise, thanks for replying :)That's really very interesting; I know that there's plenty of (IMHO absurdly underpriced) general programming talent here, but didn't know that extended to being a hotbed for appsec.If over the next few years you ever fancy finding out a bit more about Poland from a local here, feel free to drop me a line :)
                      
                  
      I hope this "under priced era" will end soon. Cost of living is pretty expensive here (in eastern Europe). It is on par and sometimes even more expensive than in USA.
                      
                  
      What if I have no real web-app experience other than what I've taught myself but I do have experience with binary analysis, embedded and kernel in MV? I had a few phone interviews a few months ago and I get the idea that's why I didn't get in, though.Maybe I'll try again real soon, though! :)
                      
                  
      You had phone interviews with us, didn't get an interview, and never found out why? That sucks. You should send me mail (I'd write you but don't know your email address).This is exactly the kind of thing I want to make sure we never do in our recruiting process.
                      
                  
      No, they did say why, after a bunch of vetting; I phrased it weird, sorry. I think I did OK, but I don't have any web app experience, and I can understand given the small team in MV. Your team did well, although, I'd like to have tried the web-app challenge. They encouraged me to apply again so I think I will this fall.
                      
                  
      Please definitely do, any time you feel up to it. We make bad calls sometimes, too; you can contact me directly if you have questions. I can do a pretty good job of predicting what the rest of the team is going to hit you with. :)
                      
                  
      Remember how Paul Graham wrote those articles about how good programmers should start companies because companies don't pay the absolute best programmers the order of magnitude more money that they may be worth?Well, it seems the marketplace has updated somewhat more towards paying programmers what they are worth.

We love rockstars (many of them are Crowdbooster users!), but we've made a conscious decision to have a culture that revolves entirely around our product, not our egos.-You've wrestled with big data before. Crowdbooster requires storing terabytes of data, extracting insights using statistical learning techniques, and making it available to our users in real-time.-That said, you like working at every level of the stack, not being pigeonholed as a backend developer.-You care a lot about the products you ship, and don't need a manager or "product guy" to motivate you to get every detail right.-You're familiar with several parts of our stack, and willing to learn the rest.

      San Francisco, CA. Full time. H1B okay.With 50% of traffic now driven by social media, and referrer information increasingly useless with mobile clients and HTTPS, traditional web analytics are no longer working. awe.sm is building full-featured social media conversion tracking and analytics.Right now and in the medium term, we're providing immediate value to our customers by giving them firm numbers on the ROI of their social media efforts, in terms of dollars, signups, pageviews or any other metric they pick. Our APIs allow app developers to easily integrate social features into their products and easily present the analyzed data back to their own customers, without having to build their own processing clusters and workflows.Longer term, we want to know what's important on the Internet, and we believe that instrumenting social behaviour is the way to do that.We're looking for back-end engineers who are interested in learning how to handle large volumes of data for aggregation, geo analysis, and graph analysis, in close to real time. Our stack is mostly PHP and Ruby right now (I know, I know) but we believe in picking the right tool for the job and are not afraid to use new tech.We're also looking for front-end developers to continue to build out our GUI, which is a backbone JS app built on top of the same APIs our customers use.http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernewsWe're 13 people right now. We have a cool new office with awesome views ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) in the heart of the Mission. We have catered lunches, and full health, vision and dental coverage.

We just received funding from prestigious VCs (unannounced).You say Content Management sucks? Thatâ€™s exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps.The initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies.Itâ€™s now time to throw away the prototype of our API and to build a high-performance solution, from scratch. We want to bring aboard a person who will develop the new JavaScript frontend, public JS SDK and JavaScript server component with us (yes, weâ€™re developers too!).Weâ€™re looking for someone who already has a solid experience in writing and testing JavaScript applications and that has a good knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem (CoffeeScript, Node, Rhino, ClojureScript) and its frameworks (Backbone, Spine etc). You should have a good Computer Science foundation and an authentic interest in working with JavaScript. Experience in functional programming languages will be considered a plus. One of the main jobs besides developing will be to involve the JS community with talks at conferences and interesting prototypes.Interested? Please send your GitHub account and any other interesting links about you to sascha@thriventures.com.P.S.: The only language in the company is English and living in Berlin without any knowledge of German isn't a problem at all.

jobs@refresh.io
You're a crack-shot software engineer. Not necessarily because of where you went to school, but because simply put - you love this stuff. You know at least one mobile/web-related computer language cold. Whether it's Objective-C, Ruby, Java Javascript, or others - we're not too concerned about which one because no matter which one (or ones) we end up using, you'll not only be able to pick it up fast, you'll be excited about doing so.
You understand the latest technology. From NoSQL to Backbone to Node. You aren't technically religious and gain as much satisfaction in picking the right tool for the job as you do implementing it.
You've built stuff. Web sites. Mobile apps. Whatever. You can show us. You can't wait to show us. You're not only excited of what users can do with it, you're proud about how it's implemented and to a technical audience, and you can't wait to talk about it.
As part of the first engineering team, you're excited by the prospect of working with smart people. Because you're smart and you know it - and you know that working with other smart people simply makes you better (all the while making them better too). As a bonus, being part of this initial team gives you the opportunity to strongly affect future engineering hires - insuring the caliber of the team.
You live within commuting distance to Palo Alto, CA or are willing to relocate (paid).

      Amsterdam, The Netherlands. H1B[1]Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a developer there currently working on search and relocated over there about a year and a half ago, and have been very happy with it.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and a few CPAN modules.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it.
You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a couple of times before and have already helped get one person hired, many others have had or are having interviews, and I've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent.

      Brooklyn, NY Full TimeCustora (YC W11) is a customer analytics tool that helps retailers earn more from happier customers.To be a little more specific, we can point to a single retail customer and paint a meaningful portrait with his data: How much heâ€™ll spend, how often he'll make purchases, what types of products he's inclined to buy, his predicted likelihood of returning, and more.

He made it easier for our clients to launch multiple email tests in parallel, and added four new email providers to our growing list of integrated partners.Jon and David worked together to completely redesign the interface of the application. We moved from an interface that focused on browsing through dashboards to one that delivers answers to specific questions.Outside the office, Corey and Dave manned a booth at a big e-retailer conference and developed a Blackjack-style Custora game to play with prospective clients.What We OfferOur compensation is competitive with anyone on the market.

      SF - Rails/JS - HALF-TIME-ISH :)I've mentioned before that we have a couple of engineers who work half-time-ish (and do their own things the rest of the time) and it got some positive feedback: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3850480We're ready to hire a couple more in this vein, so if it sounds interesting let me know!=========Advantages for you:- you get 2-3 extra weekend days for fun and profit- we provide health insurance and all that jazz- if some weeks you don't have lots to do and want to work more, and other weeks you have lots to do and want to work less, we can be flexible- we're profitable and growing! so if you decide "wow I really love Verba and want to spend every waking moment there" we can make that dream come trueAdvantages for us:- you have more time to learn new things, meet new people and generally be a friendlier, happier, more knowledgeable person in our workplace- we can hire faster with less anxiety (instead of the "gulp i just committed $100k/yr" feeling, we have the "smaller gulp i just committed $50k/yr" feeling :)- you get to be a part of what we're doing, we get to hear about all the cool stuff you're doing, and that can only lead to good things for both of usAnyway, I've included our spiel and "what we're looking for" summary below, so shoot me an email if you're interested (ragalie@verbasoftware.com).========The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.We're a B2B company working with just about 200 colleges and universities, and we're looking for people familiar with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck. The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.Be sure to check out our website (http://www.verbasoftware.com) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us.

      San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.Academia.edu has over 1.3 million registered users, and over 3.7 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,000 academics join each day.We need talented engineers to come and help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that there is a chance to make a big impact.We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We have a strong engineering culture. We're a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:â˜… building new features (a conference feature, a discussion feature for papers)â˜… enhancing existing features (News Feed, Profile page, paper upload tools)â˜… building back-end infrastructure to scale the siteWhat we're looking for are:â˜€ 2+ years of web development experienceâ˜€ Experience with the full engineering stackâ˜€ Passion for engineeringAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture. There is more information here http://academia.edu/hiring.H1B candidates are very welcome. We will take care of the visa process.If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu

We're looking for a brilliant developer to join two busy co-founders to help take the product and company to the next level.== About you ==You're passionate about producing beautiful, elegant code.

Each of our clients faces a different problem in how to manage the information in their business. Our current clients include consultancies, private health, insurance, training, and a tax information provider. Standard small business tools aren't good enough, but the large enterprise solutions are overkill and user-hostile. We work with our clients to design a customised solution built on our core information management platform, and host their data ongoing.We launched to our first clients three years ago and have steadily built an enthusiastic user base. We're a bootstrapped company, funded entirely by revenue from our clients. With no investors, we can focus solely on producing a great product for happy clients.ONEIS is a collaboration between myself, a developer, and my co-founder, an Information Architect. We've used her expertise to radically rethink how digital information should be managed, and our client satisfaction shows we got it right.== About the role ==You'll start by building server-side JavaScript plugins to implement custom features for our clients. These are quick to write, so you'll work on lots of interesting and varied projects from the start.When you're happy with that, your responsibilities will expand. This will be a bit of everything from developing the core Platform to a spot of systems admin. You may not be familiar with the full stack yet, but you'll be keen to learn it all in a fast-paced environment.== More info ==* We primarily use JavaScript (Rhino interpreter), JRuby and PostgreSQL, and develop on Mac OS X.* Documentation for our JavaScript API: http://docs.oneis.co.uk/dev/plugin* Some of our clients talking about the system: http://www.oneis.co.uk/openday* Our jobs page: http://www.oneis.co.uk/jobsMy contact details are in my profile.

      I work at Luluvise. For me, the most amazing thing working there is the quality and the level of the team.
Sounds like a lot of snake oil, but I've never learned more at a job before.
                      
                  
      Wrong thread.  Post here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4184757
                      
                  
      Thanks for the ping. Not sure how i made that error.
                      
                  
      Curious why this was downvoted? Is it because it's not paid?
                      
                  
      Looks more to me because they are trying to hire an intern to do actual work for the company. That is a huge no-no. The general rule of thumb is that intern's should be there to learn, not help the companies bottom-dollar.Just a quick example we had a paid intern communication design student for a short while. She would come in and take direction from the Art Director on her semi-plausible tasks as if she was working except we never used anything she produced.
                      
                  
      Sure, probably a bit too early for us to get interns. Thanks for actually commenting not just downvoting.
