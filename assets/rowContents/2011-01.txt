In New York City there are a lot of jobs. I went to 3 job interviews and got offers from 2. All 3 had tests of my programming skill, though the 3rd was ruthless about minor syntax errors. For instance, the guy talking to me asked me how to find all of the Apache servers running on a server. He just wanted the number. I typed:ps aux | grep apache | wc -lbut this wrongly included the command I was typing. We were working on their dev server and I was typing the commands into the terminal. I got back 12 when the real answer was 11. He eventually showed me what I should have typed:ps aux | grep apache | grep -v grep | wc -lThe grep -v screens out the line I had just typed which had "grep apache" in it. Of course, there are other ways to do this, but this was the first thing I thought of. Of my error, I thought that was somewhat minor, but this guy had recently been hired to clean up a sloppy programming department, so he was looking for programmers who were flawless.The other 2 tests at the other 2 jobs covered the usual questions (write a JOIN statement, write a sub-query, what is the difference between GET and POST?). On one of the interviews, 2 programmers came in to talk to me and they gave me a short PHP script which was working but which was badly written. They asked me how I would re-write it. Easy enough.My sense is there is a lot of hiring going on in New York City. Possibly not enough local talent to fill all the jobs, but the businesses are here for other reasons (other than programming talent) so I think eventually programming talent from elsewhere will get drawn to New York City. There are some cities in the USA that are in deep economic decline, and will probably remain so for the next 5 years, so perhaps some of the programmers from those cities will migrate to New York City.
                      
                  
      Email him this, which is more succinct and does the same:ps aux | grep [a]pache | wc -l(because you use the character class, it doesn't find itself as what it searches for is different than its text)
                      
                  
      [OT] Wouldn't "ps aux | grep -c [a]pache" work the same way? Everyone seems to put "| wc -l|" but I have used the -c option to do that directly.
                      
                  
      Or justpgrep httpd | wc -l
                      
                  
      Or justpgrep -c apache

      I consider myself a good developer but that grep apache thing is something I would have to look up.I only use grep once or twice a month on average.  Why do employers expect you to have every possibly relevant thing memorized?  I hate it.
</rant>
                      
                  
      I use grep several times a week. If the job is one that will leverage command line skills, it would make sense to understand grep. It's not like "grep [f]oo" is an alien command; it's basically a pattern.
                      
                  
      I do see your point but still if you have an otherwise good web developer I'm sure he can learn grep.I've been meaning to make a web comic where software companies end up with Exactly the employees they interview for. Eg the boss asks "why the does the guy we hired keep solving project Euler problems all day?"
                      
                  
      ps ax|grep -Ei '(apache|httpd)'|grep Ss|wc -llsof|grep TCP|grep -Ei '(apache|httpd)|cut -f 1 -d ' '|sort|uniq|wc -lapache -S 2>&1|grep server|wc -lapache2ctl -S 2>&1|grep server|wc -lare processes/threads really servers?  His question was a bit ambiguous.  I wouldn't have accepted that job position either.  :)
                      
                  
      Ambiguous questions are great to ask candidates.  It helps to filter out those that neither realize the ambiguity nor ask clarifying questions. Questioning before compliance is a valuable important trait.
                      
                  
      Completely off-topic, but...  ps aux | grep apache | grep -v grep | wc -l

A more succinct, albeit less portable, alternative is 'pgrep apache | wc -l'.  (Or 'pgrep httpd | wc -l', depending on your apache commandline.)
                      
                  
      Chicago (or remote)Matasano SecurityLEAD SOFTWARE DEVELOPERYOU BRING: experience in a key role shipping a web-based product, systems programming chops, comfort with performant network code. Interest, but not not necessarily expertise, in web security.WE BRING: deep and commanding mastery of software security, a fun productâ€ , a customer list, a small team with a minimal viable working offering, a profitable and growing company with a 5 year track record and nice officesâ€ â€  in NYC, Chicago, and SFBA.â€ web scale, big(ish) data, search, security; we're a Rails/Ruby/EventMachine shop. We don't care if you already know Ruby.Full-time in-house non-consulting dev. Health, dental, 401k, commute, &c.HN is one of our best hiring vectors (ask 'yan, 'wglb, and 'daeken). We hire two roles: vulnerability researchers and software developers. HN has killed for security researchers. Not so much for developers. Ironic!Just mail me: tqbf at matasano dot com.â€ â€ here's Chicago, on top of one of the coolest buildings in the city, with Intelligentsia Coffee and a serviceable bar on the first floor: http://img228.imageshack.us/g/img0226yl.jpg/ 
                      
                  
      Oh, and we give everyone unlimited free tech books:http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1639193People seem to think this is a big deal, even though I think it's one of the biggest no-brainer win-win benefits ever.
                      
                  
      I usually am critical of tech "perks", mostly from the bad taste in my mouth that foosball tables and free junk food from the dot com era left...But that, good sir, is probably one of the smartest tech perks I've ever seen.  Kudos.
                      
                  
      I really like that policy. It's clear what's allowed, what's definitely not, where the gray areas are, and who to talk to to get answer.
                      
                  
      That's awesome. Every tech company should do this for their technical employees. Heck, why shouldn't the sales guy get unlimited books related to his job. Such a small cost compared to the potential rewards.
                      
                  
      Thomas, I've been curious about this for the past several "who's hiring" threads: What do your devs do? Specifically the web-ruby dev(s)? Are you building a web-based security product? Is it the classic transition from consulting to product type play? Does the product exist yet? Are customers using it? How much of your business does the product represent? If these are sensitive questions, pardon me, I'm really just interested as someone who follows you here on HN.
                      
                  
      We currently sell a product (Playbook) that manages firewalls for large companies that have lots and lots of firewalls. Think Github, but for network security teams. That product is staffed by full-time developers (not consultants).We are starting work on a new, totally unrelated product. Same deal: small team of full-time developers, "funded" by the output of our (considerably larger) consulting shop.We're not at a place where we're comfortable talking specifically about what the new product is, but it meshes with our consulting services much more than Playbook does; it's a web application security offering.
                      
                  
      It is a beautiful building http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadnock_Building in a city with many beautiful buildings.  Some say that the coffee shop http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/locations/view/Monadnock... is the best in chicago, and i hear that the NY staff likes it as well.There are some particular mysteries of the building that Matasano is privy to.  For example the "John Malkovich" door with its own office number: http://img228.imageshack.us/i/img0226yl.jpg/.  And there is the fact that we are the only office on the 18th floor of a 16 story building.  (And despite First Blood trying to get me with the swimming pool, that is not part of the deal.)And the people here are absolutely awesome.
                      
                  
      Intelligentsia in the main floor of the Monadnock Bldg. is one of the few things I genuinely miss about working downtown. I hated the commute, but be damned if that isn't some of the finest coffee I've had.A crowd of us would walk there from CBOT to get it every morning (passing no less than three Starbucks' and a now-defunct Lavazza); it would have been very bad if they had been in the same building as me. ;)
                      
                  
      I am not overly fond of the commute (i prefer to work from my home office) but I live close to the Metra station, it is a healthy walk to and from Monadnock, and I have internet access on the train, so that reduces the commute discomfort.
                      
                  
      I've only been to the Intelligentsia location in Silver Lake (Los Angeles), but I do recall having excellent coffee there.
                      
                  
      I emailed you guys last time and never heard anything back :-(
                      
                  
      That is because I suck. You asked a pretty interesting question about our business, I put the message aside to write a long response to it, and dropped the ball. You're one of a couple people in my "Drafts" folder. Cold comfort, I know, but I apologize.
                      
                  
      I feel better knowing you made an effort ;-)  Well, shoot me a response or partial-response if you ever get a chance.
                      
                  
      I will cosign 100%. NYC office is in a great location (located a block east from Union Sq) and has awesome people in it!

      The Amazon Web Services team is hiring for on-site positions in Seattle (WA), Luxembourg, Tokyo, Herndon (VA), and Cape Town (South Africa), Dublin (Ireland), and Slough (UK). We don't offer remote work, but some of the positions do include relocation assistance.I've scraped our official job site and used the data to create a tag cloud of the jobs at http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/jobs/all_aws_jobs.html . I'm still working on the styling.The official AWS job site is at Our official job site is http://aws.amazon.com/jobs .There are too many types of jobs to list here. We need developers, business developers, managers, solutions architects, trainers, and technical support.
                      
                  
      AWS seems to have more open positions than I would imagine they should. What are the turnover/pay/working conditions like there?
                      
                  
      I don't have an official turnover figure, but I've been there 8.5 years and counting.As far as working conditions, people show up and they work. We don't have a whole lot of toys or frills at the office. We don't get free food or drinks, but we are paid well and can afford to buy our own. The focus is on meeting customer needs and on shipping stuff that works well and doesn't break as it scales or endures heavy loads. We ship often and run fast (see the AWS blog at http://aws.typepad.com to get an idea of how fast).Teams are responsible for building and running services, and for fixing them when they break. Many teams measure the number of high-priority tickets generated by their services over the course of a year and set year-over-year goals to drive the number down. As a dev, you might get to carry a pager from time to time, and you will learn to build services that are so robust that they never wake you up :-).We are really happy with the success of AWS to date, and that's why we are hiring.As a new employee you'll be put to work right away on something that is of real and immediate value to the company. You'll learn on the job and you'll get to rub shoulders with really sharp people.Pay is competitive by industry standards and is generally a mix of cash and stock grants. We also have a full suite of benefits.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the great answer! It sounds very professional. I've read most of Steve Yegge's old blog posts, and was always struck by how Amazon's culture is one that values solid technical skills and experience.
                      
                  
      You are welcome. Will you be applying?
                      
                  
      I've actually been looking at Amazon recently and found the number of positions available overwhelming. I think I would do well in dozens of the positions posted.I don't know if I should be applying to a bunch of positions to get a better feel of which one is "best" or if I should approach it differently.How would you suggest proceeding when so many positions seem to be relevant?
                      
                  
      There's a bug in your tag cloud: You're splitting on whitespace.  The tag "venture capitalists", for example, really isn't the same as the tag "venture" plus the tag "capitalists"...
                      
                  
      That's a tough bug to fix. I use each word in the title and location, minus a list of stop words. There's no intelligence or built-in vocabulary.
                      
                  
      There's no intelligence or built-in vocabulary.Have you tried automatically learning a vocabulary based on seeing which words go together often?  I'm thinking e.g., if the word "Block" is followed by the word "Store" more than X% of the time, there should probably be an atomic "Block Store" tag.Hmm, this sounds like a fun puzzle.  Can you send me your dataset?

      Copenhagen, Denmark. Remote not possible and we can't help with relocation.I've just been hired as CTO for a well-funded startup, Greenwire. We recycle used consumer electronics (Primarily mobile phones) and send them for refurbishment and resale.I'm looking for a developer to help me build the IT infrastructure. We'll be working on LAMP technology, probably PHP.Have a read at http://greenwiregroup.com/
                      
                  
      Just a bit of feedback here: When you can't help with relocation (which definitely can be costly, don't get me wrong) you contradict the notion that you're a well-funded startup.
                      
                  
      Thanks for the heads up. The problem is more a practical concern than a financial one. If you have a work permit (EU citizen), then we we would consider you, but I would be lying if I said I wouldn't prefer a local candidate.

      tl;dr: Mozilla is hiring, and we have many different kinds of positions open.  Main offices are in Mountain View, Toronto, Auckland, Paris; remote work very much a possibility, esp for people with experience doing it.  I know most about engineering, but the fullish list is off http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/careersPlatform engineers: the native-code guts of Firefox, you could work on things ranging from network protocols to scripting performance, 3D graphics to parallelism, performance tuning to debugging and instrumentation.  And you get to deliver new web capabilities to about half a billion people.  Want to make contentEditable not suck?  Want to fix the CSS layout model so people don't miss tables?  Want to make Flash and Silverlight sweat more bullets?  Us too.Firefox engineers: 2011 is going to be a very exciting year for Firefox, and we have lots of ambitious work planned.  There is lots systems work as we move to a multi-process model, as well as lots of "app logic" and more traditional front-end stuff.  Client-side web skills map well, and we want to make them map even better; you can help with that too.Web developer tools: we're going to be significantly increasing our investment in developer tools, to improve the web development experience dramatically.  Package up the complexities of the web platform and make it grokkable to everyone from a grade-schooler to jeresig.Engineering management: we need more people who know how to make developers successful and satisfied, and get joy out of doing it.  Our engineering organization spans the globe, has a scope as broad as the web itself, and competes against the biggest software companies in the world.Developer infrastructure: we run a large software operation on open source tools, and want to make everything from crash reporting to bugzilla to mercurial to the build system work better.  Take the hard information problems of software development, make web apps and other tools to help understand and solve them.  If you have partially automated your breakfast routine, and want to play with some pretty large-scale data, this could be a lot of fun.Security: program management and penetration testing both.  Your purview is security at the full breadth of the web.Web development, apps big and small: top-25 web properties (without ads), software update systems for 420M+ users, demos for new web technologies, crash analytics systems backed by dozens of Hadoop nodes.Mozilla is a non-profit organization chartered to improve the web.  We pay competitive salaries, have great benefits, and work in the open.  Wake up every morning glad you get to do the right thing!
                      
                  
      So I just signed a full-time contract with Mozilla and I will be starting as a Mobile Software Engineer next week. Mostly focusing on iOS development but also other platforms.This is quite a change for me. For the past 15 years I have been doing consulting work and startups on my own and I've always been in charge of my own time and plans. I had never really considered a 'real' job until I started working at Mozilla. That is how awesome they are.I started working for them in August as a contractor. On the Sync client for iOS, Firefox Home.It did not take long before I noticed that Mozilla operated very differently than most companies that I had done work for. Mozilla is all about quality and doing the right thing versus maximizing profits and keeping shareholders happy. For me that was a real eye-opener and a change that I was looking for in my professional career.One thing that I love about Mozilla is that we work in the open. There are no secrets. I have friends at companies like Apple and they are not allowed to talk to their spouse about what they do. That is horrible. Mozilla is completely the opposite. Everything that I do is open. It is part of the mission. It is highly encouraged to share, collaborate and participate.But don't think this is all easy. Mozilla's mission does require a lot of hard and professional work, organization, deadlines and crazy hours. But I don't care about so much, because it is fun to do that, and because you know it is not to make your CEO rich when they IPO, instead you do it to make the (digital) world a better place. Different mission. Different kind of reward.I've been working in Toronto office and at home since August. Together with great people from a team distributed over Mountain View, Germany and France. We meet on IRC, email, and phone conferences.I've also been to Mountain View to participate in the quarterly work week, where all Mozilla people from all over the globe get together to meet and to get stuff done. Pretty awesome to get almost 300 smart folks together.I personally don't think money should be the biggest motivator, but the compensation is excellent. Competitive salaries, good benefits, lots of perks. Mozilla takes great care of their biggest asset: people.This will be a great year :-)
                      
                  
      I'd like to also add: QA Engineers.   If you're interested in testing browsers on desktop, mobile, and cloud services, this is the place for you.   From black box, whitebox, automation tools, web development tools... you'll be touching cutting edge technologies and working with brilliant engineers in ensuring high quality to Firefox.  Lastly, you will help guide our international community of testers in how to better test Mozilla products.  Check the careers link for more information.
                      
                  
      Mozilla will also be expanding its Services efforts in 2011. Firefox Sync will be integrated into Firefox 4 and ship to millions of users. Help us make it scale on desktop, mobile and the server. Help us design new and exciting services at the same scale for the next generation browsers.
                      
                  
      You know I wish I could. I completely believe in your mission but I just do not have the coding chops. It makes me so sad every time I realize the gulf that exists between my ambition and my ability :(
                      
                  
      You can start writing patches now, there are tons of resources to get started. Pick a small bug on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ (even fixing a typo) and fix it. It may take a week, but who cares? You can get help via patch reviews and asking questions on IRC (irc.mozilla.org)There is also a lot of resources on wiki.mozilla.org about all our projects and how to get started.Don't let your inexperience stop you. It will certainly take a while to improve. All great programmers have years, even decades of experience.There are also lots of other ways to help: QA (http://quality.mozilla.org/), Support (http://support.mozilla.com/), Review personas (http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/),  and marketing (http://www.spreadfirefox.com/)More info: http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/

      We've got a development opening for a full time position at my startup, Bloom Health.http://gobloomhealth.com/jobs/software-engineerBloom Health is a VC funded startup with about 20 employees (including 5 developers currently).Our offices are in downtown Minneapolis and are connected to the skyway.  100% remote working isn't an option currently, but we're flexible enough that working from home a day or two a week isn't a problem.We develop on macbook pros with external monitors, and deploy our solution on Amazon's EC2 platform.  Smart and fun people drinking free soda and working with groovy and grails, continuous integration, test coverage metrics, user stories, distributed version control, etc.  All the things you'd want and expect in a startup, plus a business model that actually has a shot at paying off as an added perk.

      1010data is hiring in NYC.  Standard black-and-white descriptions of the current job openings are at http://www.1010data.com/company/careers/current-job-openings (warning: links on that page are to PDFs) and you can find out what we do at http://www.1010data.com/company, but here's a little extra color especially for HN:(1) We are looking for someone (v. 'Infrastructure Engineer') who'd be excited to take on the challenge of helping to run, and ultimately running, a rapidly expanding cluster of hundreds of high-performance servers at several datacenters.  The environment is pretty unconventional (99.4% proprietary software, for example, and we prefer to use an "exotic" language - K - even for infrastructure purposes); I'd say it's much more comparable to academic/scientific clusters than to your typical web application company.  So that kind of background wouldn't hurt!  At the same time, though, you need to know Windows, 'cause we don't use Linux yet, and you need to know Linux, 'cause we will sooner or later, and you need to be really au courant on the standard datacenter stuff (networking, firewalls, security, backup and replication, racking hardware, receiving -- and making  -- urgent phonecalls at inconvenient times, etc.).  As you can imagine, this is a bit of a hard job to fill... you need to be highly experienced (because we need your experience to support the serious growth we're in the middle of) and yet have an extremely flexible mindset (since we do things in such an atypical way).  But if you're the right person to fill it, the rewards will be substantial.  Be the guy in charge of hundreds of some of the hardest-working servers out there: 1010data is the fastest analytical database on the planet, and our customers are pounding the cluster 24/7...(2) We are also looking for a 'Web Application Developer'.  But again, the dry job posting belies the fact we need something a bit unconventional.  What we really mean by this is a hacker who just happens to really love hacking in JavaScript.  This is, I sense, a rare combination.  But it does exist (we have verified examples at 1010data).  We are developing cutting-edge browser-based interfaces to aforementioned fastest analytical database on the planet and since JS is the Language of the Browser... well, that's probably why you, JavaScript Hacker, chose JS.  Right?  Oh, you say it's because it's kind of an awesome language in its own right?  OK, well, whatever the reason: if you hack JS and want to develop cutting-edge browser-based interfaces for manipulating and visualizing large datasets... please, please apply for this job.  You're going to love it at 1010data.(3) We are looking for a 'Systems Developer'.  We're not 100% sure how to define this, to be honest, but to paraphrase Justice Stewart, we'll know you when we see you.  You need to know a lot about Windows internals, but ideally also Unix/Linux, since one of the major projects you'll be involved in will be a gradual environment shift.  You'll be diagnosing performance issues.  You'll be trying to wring more speed from our already very efficient cluster.  You'll be writing code (bonus! in an exotic language!) to move data around, to do logging and performance reporting, and who knows what else.  You're going to be the guy we all go to when it comes to the low-level arcana, so you're very familiar with the Way Things Work.  You know who you are.  Let us know too.If you think any of the above is you... then write to jobs@1010data.com and mention that you saw Adam's post at HN.1010data, by the way, is a fantastic place to work.  We've got a whole floor in a grand old midtown building populated with a small but growing bunch of very dedicated, very smart, very happy people.  We're growing fast, so there's a lot of energy, and you'll be working hard, but what you do will matter.  No one is doing superfluous work at 1010.  Your stuff will be used.  You get all the startup excitement, but without the startup risk - 1010's a well-established company; we've been around since before the turn of the century.  Which, these days, is almost as long as it sounds!
                      
                  
      Let's say I have two kids, can you show me on a google map, a neighborhood I'd be able to afford on a 1010data salary?
                      
                  
      A number of employees have one or more kids.  Off the top of my head, they live in New Jersey (commute on NJ Transit), Long Island (LIRR), upstate (Metro North), i.e. the traditional NY suburbs, as well as in Manhattan and Brooklyn; that is, pretty much the whole spectrum is represented.  In general it's safe to say that living in Manhattan is always going to involve compromises.  Manhattan apartments are small and expensive.  There's a strong tendency for families to move out to the suburbs, where there's greenery, space, and good schools.  This is helped by the relatively good commuting infrastructure; it takes some of the NJ guys less time to get to the office than it takes me to get in on the subway from our house in Brooklyn.I'm a New Yorker, but I'm not a real estate maven, and it'd be hard for me to suggest specific neighborhoods without knowing the specifics of your situation.  Renting or buying?  One- or two-income household?  What do you do, what does your spouse do?  And so on.  But there are lots of options, and most of them are represented by at least one person at the company, so if you come and interview you can ask around :-)

      TorontoWEB/MOBILE DEVELOPER (we have no titles, actually, but this is the best description we could figure)About us: Small company, about 15 folks, with offices in Chicago, Toronto, and Hyderabad (India). We specialize in disruptive technologies and business models, and we bring that knowledge to companies and organizations that are established and need to adapt or perish. We grew 300% last year, expecting the same this year, and this is a really exciting time to be with the company. You can feel electricity in the air around our offices.We work with a variety of systems - we build pretty advanced platforms on Drupal (we're one of the only Enterprise Drupal partners in Canada), we build things from scratch with PHP/CodeIgnter, we build apps with Objective-C, etc. If you want to learn how to build wicked stuff and want to start a company somewhere down the line, this is a great place to work. Hell, you're even encouraged to work on a potential startup in your 15% time.About you: Background in computer/software engineering or computer science is preferred, but we're open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a nonconventional degree. We're looking for 1-2yrs experience (if you're fresh out of school get in touch anyway). Double points if you have startup experience.We mostly work in PHP, but diverse language experience is a plus. It's more important that you're smart and driven than that you're a PHP expert. If you've played around with iOS development, HTML5, Python, Android dev, Facebook app dev, etc., those are all positives.About the position: You'll be tasked with building important systems for interesting clients, with plenty of technical challenges and opportunities to learn as you go. You'll work in a Scrum team, primarily in PHP to start - you'll also likely learn how to build complex systems in Drupal.If you're a startup guy/gal, you'll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You'll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future. Bonus points if you like to endlessly philosophize.Perks: Benefits (drug, dental, massage, etc.), 15% time (take a half day a week to build awesome stuff), relocation (if you're not located in the GTA), technical books (if you want 'em, you can have 'em), conferences, training.Pay: We have a saying that goes like this: "Hire 5 people who can do the work of 10 and get the pay of 8". We want smart, driven developers, and we pay what it takes to get them.How to apply: Email dustin (at) myplanetdigital (dot) com
