      How similar is Blue card to Green card? How easy it is to change employers in EU (But I guess, that would depend on particular country, Germany in this case).Btw, wish you all the best in your recruiting endeavours!
                      
                  
      Thanks for the kind words :)For the Blue Card, you can change employers as much as you want because it's attached to the employee rather than the employer. Further, depending on the country, after two or three years, you can then legally take work in any other EEA country (except the UK, Ireland and Denmark, all of whom opted out of the Blue Card program). There are some technicalities involved, but those are the basics.Germany's program is particularly great because you can get a permanent residency permit after only two years if you learn German (to a B2 level, I think), or after three years if you don't speak German. In other words, it's a permanent entry into the EU. I'm an American living in France and I'm married to a French woman, so I don't have to worry, but otherwise, I'd apply for the Blue Card in a heartbeat!
                      
                  
      Interesting. I guess Blue Card is not for freelancers, right? i.e. to just directly apply on my own.Another scenario - I'm a contractor/freelancer working for some non-EU company, but just want to live some period in EU, without changing a job. (Reasons could be e.g. a better school for children, etc..)
                      
                  
      It's not for freelancers, no. You can go to Germany and stay up there for up to six months while looking for work, but to get a Blue Card, you have to have a contract with an annual salary attached to it. Your Blue Card is good for the length of the contract plus three months. However, as mentioned, if you stay long enough, you can apply for permanent German residency.Keep in mind that the German government has been tweaking the Blue Card law, so you probably want to reverify what I've said if you go that route. That being said, I just received a PM on Reddit from someone who moved to Germany after seeing a post I made about the Blue Card and they just got a job offer. They're going to sign and apply for their Blue Card with that contract.
                      
                  
      Is the Blue card valid for all of Europe or only Germany? If a german company gives me a blue card can i apply for a job in france or will the french company have to apply for the blue card too? What i am trying to understand is if it is like the H1B visa.
                      
                  
      Seems like a good program. Thanks for sharing.

      I gather this is for Booking.com, the company that is famous in the Perl community for treating its developers like dogs.
http://blogs.perl.org/users/bookingemployee/2012/03/truth-ab...
                      
                  
      The Netherlands has a very attractive 30% tax reduction for knowledge migrants which makes it attractive for foreign talent to come to the country.It seems to almost be a common denominator that when Dutch companies stop valuing their employees (treat them badly, seeing them as expenses, etc.) they start abusing this tax reduction to recruit cheap foreign labour; often after they've burned their bridges in the small and tightly-knit local tech community.So ... If you're a foreigner and are considering moving to the Netherlands, be careful with companies where the majority of employees is not native, since there's a good change you won't get to experience the respectful work culture Dutch companies are generally famous for.If you're already used to a culture with a greater power-distance (e.g. Russia, US, India) it might still not be all that bad for you though and either way it's pretty easy to find good jobs elsewhere once you're in the country.
                      
                  
      Indeed, Senior Dutch Perl programmers have left the company as they couldn't take this exploitation any more. The aim of the company management is to get developers from other countries who are unaware/ignorant of this dog treatment. They are trying very hard to stop their bad reputation from spreading but as you mentioned the developer community is closely knit and it doesn't take long for the word to spread.What is sad though is Ovid-who is a reputable member of the Perl community, still recruits for them despite having worked for Booking and got burnt out for exactly those reasons that the blog talks about.
                      
                  
      brian (if this is indeed the same brian d foy, I don't know since he always uses 'd' with his name, per his style guide: http://www252.pair.com/comdog/style.html), I'm rather surprised to see you writing this.First, it should be clear that for obvious reasons, I can't identify the company in question. My wife and I are starting a company trying to help people live their dream of living in other countries and that's a very hard thing to do. You (if you're really brian) know that I write http://www.overseas-exile.com/ and I've been writing that for years trying to help people move abroad because I love being an expat. We created this company because now we have a chance to really help people do what I'm so passionate about, but when someone tears down our work it also threatens to take away another chance for people to experience life abroad. The fact that we're doing this with IT companies is almost incidental: it's our background and it's what we know best.What we don't do is throw CVs at a company without telling the candidate what the location and the company are like because it's important for the candidate to decide for themselves, rather than simply rely on rumors. We get to know the companies we work with so we can make sure that the candidate is happy with the company and the company is happy with the candidate. Everyone we've helped move abroad has thanked us and I don't believe anyone has any illusions that we're promising them a gold-plated Ferrari and a personal masseuse.Regarding your comments about Booking.com and my reasons for leaving, people have asked and I publicly stated my reasons at http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/12/moving-to-paris.htm.... However, I was very cagey about that because much of the reason was intensely personal and nobody's darned business, but since you're attacking me by saying it's a "sad" thing I'm doing, I'll say it now: my wife had just had a baby, was very tired, and wanted to move back to her home country. I love my wife very dearly and I would do anything to help her. So off to France we went. Making a decision to move to another country is very hard and there are always many factors that come into play, but that was the primary reason and I've already told a few people about it privately, but I didn't shout it from the rooftops because it's nobody's business that my wife was tired and wanted to go home. Did I gripe about other issues from time to time? Sure, everyone does. But my primary motivation was my wife and daughter and it worked: my wife is very happy.There are still plenty of well-known senior Perl developers who are at Booking.com: Yves, Rafael, Ã†var, and many others who are known by first name to much of the community. Booking.com isn't a good fit for everyone, and not everyone is good fit for Booking.com -- that describes every business on the planet.I also see that you linked to that "truth about Booking.com" post. I've never publicly commented on that simply because people have strong feelings about that company and just like vi versus emacs, I saw no point in wading into the debate.So I'll say this about that post: that was clearly an anonymous disgruntled employee and that should be a warning sign to anyone who read it. Whoever they are, they've never been willing to stand up and take responsibility for their words, though if they're still working there, I could understand why. Their post was a mixture of truths, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Plus, I felt there was a lot of lying by omission. Note how many Booking employees responded (all but one of whom I know personally). They were honest about the company and generally positive about it. Some people don't understand why so many extremely talented Perl developers are happy to work there, but that alone should give people pause.By now most people probably know that Booking.com isn't a "modern Perl" shop, but they're not "treating their employees like dogs". They're extremely business-oriented and while I don't always agree with their decisions, the fact that they've managed to become one of the largest internet properties on the planet says something about what they're doing right. And if you work for them and do well, you'll get plenty of advancement opportunities if you want it. And I also know plenty of programmers working for them who have earned fantastic bonuses by producing great results. They pay a fair salary for Amsterdam, bonuses, and if you qualify for the Dutch 30% ruling, you get an extra several hundred euros a month.TL;DR: They're not for everyone, but the rumor mill is just that: a rumor factory.
                      
                  
      hmmm, not impressed by your 'help'.  i contacted you a couple of months ago and only received the initial default response to push over my resume and info and never got a reply once i sent it over.  pretty poor way to communicate and start a business.
                      
                  
      papaver, I can understand your being upset and I want to apologize. In going back through our mail queue I can find your email in a backup mailbox I use, but we can't find it in the main mailbox. In fact, you say you received a response, but I can't even find that replied to you! I'm very sorry about this and now we're trying to figure out what happened.As you can imagine, we get a lot of email for these positions, but to the best of my knowledge, we've never missed one before (but obviously, if we did miss a candidate, we wouldn't know, would we?). Now that I've located your initial April 3rd email, we'll get in touch, but obviously if you're not still interested, we understand.Again, my sincerest apologies.
                      
                  
      My takeaway from this is that stay as far away as possible from Booking.com.You might certainly say they are not a good fit for everyone, but I think when someone in HN community is looking for a job change, I am sure they are also looking at the other "intangible"/not-so-obvious aspects. Like: does the company treat every employee respectfully? Do they provide the right environment where even the underdog can excel? They can be business minded, but do they understand their core cannot be culturally immoral?On all counts Booking has fell short to me (just from your justification).Sad but true.
                      
                  
      For those without showdead on; it seems that Brian (not-D) Foy was hellbanned for his comments.It seems obvious that he is a disgruntled ex-employee so you should take his statements with a grain of salt, but since I don't see any reason for hellbanning him for that (maybe he got too many flags?,) so I'm reposting them there.------------I am not Brian D Foy so stop maligning his name. Brian D Foy doesn't work for Booking and he never has.Booking tries to keep the big names you mentioned happy so that they don't spill the beans. These names get the best development projects and the big money. One of their job responsibilities as a senior developer is to advertise and say good things about the company. I concur with you that they play this game well. In fact open praise in developer forums about the company is a sure way to land good bonus.They make tonnes of money but none of that is shared with the developers although they put up with the grunge work of fixing one of the worst Perl code in the industry patched up by people who left in a hurry.I speak for those who are going to leave their family, friends at home with the hopes that they would be doing good work based on the big names working there only to find that the reality is totally different.The treatment meted out to the rest of the developers is shameful and you know it and the Perl blog mentions all the pain points.The expats do not know the local employment laws of Netherlands and Booking.com fully exploits this to the hilt.And the truth can be found out easily from people who left the company and who currently do not get a direct/indirect monetary benefit of saying good things about the company, and given that you are recruiting for them and get approximately thousand Euro atleast for every successful lead, it disqualifies you.------------The Netherlands has employee friendly policies. After three years in a company, employees automatically get an "indefinite" contract. An "indefinite" contract ensures that the employer cannot kick out the employee on a whim unlike in the US.Good Dutch companies give out indefinite contract to the expats at the beginning of their employment itself but not Booking.com.Booking.com gives out a 1 year contract to start with and after every 2 years kicks out its developers and gets new ones. So the frequent hiring you see is one of the side-effects of this cheap policy. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the big names Curtis "Ovid" Poe mentioned jumps on this mailing list to say - "not me", but the truth is this is their cheap game.So after two years the delta of ones career capital can be summed up as:1. experience in copy pasting code and cargo culting which would translate to nothing when you try out for another job.2. no monetary benefit. Booking has the most underpaid developers in the industry. Those bonuses they promise never come. Given how expensive Amsterdam is, one wouldn't have saved up a penny after two years and if you have a family you might end up in debt.In short one is ruining his/her best two years without any increase in career capital or monetary standing.
                      
                  
      I interviewed with Booking recently. My takeaway was not particularly negative, but that may be because I'm from the US.They were fairly up front about their business-first mentality, and otherwise did make a convincing case for having interesting & challenging work available at all ends of the stack.Downsides obviously being that pay is low relative to SF, and housing in Amsterdam is not particularly cheap. The city is also not for everyone, more so than most places. However, from a tech POV I don't think I would have been bored. Can't speak to the office culture, but I didn't get any scary vibes.

      Python Engineer - Philadelphia, PA - Relocation Assistance Provided.50onRed operates a premium ad network and serves over billions of online ad impressions each month. We work with large advertisers such as Groupon and eHarmony, and develop innovative products to monetize many of the web's largest shopping, dating, and social websites.  50onRed was recognized by Philly.com as one of the best places to work in Philadelphia.We want Python Engineers to join our team that are smart, passionate and thrive on the challenges of building scalable software in a high-volume, big data world.  Our core platform handles over 5 billion (with a "b") transactions per day and Python is a key ingredient in making that all possible.  If that gets you excited, we should talk.As part of our team, you will be surrounded by best-in-breed software engineers who are well versed in not only Python, but also with Java, PHP, AWS, and NoSQL... (not to mention ping-pong and craft brews!)  We work hard on tackling the challenges of big data and we have fun doing it.Qualifications:-Commercial Python development experience (more than just scripting)
-NoSQL, MongoDB, or other "big data"
-Comp Sci background and strong competencies in data structures, algorithms and scalable software design
-Ability to alternate between different development tools and languages - no one trick ponies welcome here!
-Energetic and passionate about technology

      I worked on a project (probably one of your competitors) that was an ad network. It also used Python as the language of choice (with gevent to handle all of the requests). It's an interesting choice for such system. Do you have a blog with info on your stack? It'd be fun to read about how you handle such traffic. Also, if you want to talk shoot me an email (on profile).
                      
                  
      Front-End Developer - Philadelphia, PA - 50onRed - Relocation Assistance ProvidedFor anyone that sees this, I also work at 50onRed as the Director of Product and am hiring someone for my team.As Wellington said, 50onRed operates an ad network that serves billions of requests per day. To support those operations we also build dashboard and campaign management interfaces that are used by 1,000's of advertisers.One unique thing we have to offer at 50onRed is that the product team is given a lot of freedom to drive the product based on customer needs, feedback, and data we collect on usage and engagement. And it's not just lip service! So, with that being said, the product team houses product managers, community managers, UX engineers, and now we are looking for a front-end developer.Why is it cool to be on the product team? If you have a strong opinion on something the product should do, you no longer need to worry about your boss in engineering telling you no because it's a PITA due to some backend reasons. Now, the product team will have your back and work on getting any changes implemented to get what you need done.What will the front-end developer do? You will be an EXPERT in javascript, html, and css. And not building simple jQuery toggles or copy pasting some code from stackoverflow. Our dashboards are moving quickly towards being more "AJAX-y". To help with the amount of JS, we are creating re-usable javascript widgets that can be used across different parts of the app. You should understand the implications of different JS decisions on browser performance, flexibility of how the widget can be used in different scenarious, etc. You can take a mockup from our UX Engineer (that was created after discussions with you, of course) and code it up with ease.Why 50? Because you want to make decisions that impact 1,000's of customers in your first week. We push code frequently and test how it's used by our customers. We get feedback from our customers instantly. You want to take ownership and drive a product to be better. Do you think we should be a one page web app and use Angular? Great, sell us on it and let's do it. You think Prototype is 100x better than jQuery? Ok, then sell us on that instead. (Might be hard!) But... the point is that we are open to using any technology that is right for the job as long as it is the right business decision. No emotional attachments to code.Email frank@50onred.com, I'd love to talk to you if you think you'd be a good fit.

      h1b/green card ?
                      
                  
      I'm just chiming in to say we're always hiring. Some of our best team members have come from HN.http://www.matasano.com/careers/
                      
                  
      One thing that is interesting with these "always hiring" shops - Do you have a high turnover or do you constantly extend the office space?
                      
                  
      We don't have high turnover. We're in a rapidly expanding field (demand far outstrips supply in software security), and we're selective, by which I mean we could grow a lot faster than we have over the last 8 years if we elected not to hold quality constant.
                      
                  
      It typically means they're always willing to hire, provided the fit is right.
                      
                  
      The specific technical answer in our case is: if we have a headcount cap, I don't know what it is.
                      
                  
      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the currency markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We
design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure,
down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We
are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add
one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However,
you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be
able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory.  We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data.  NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss.  Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters.  Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable.  This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis.  Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.  If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.For more details go to http://amacapital.net/careers.html

      We're a small team, and we prefer that everyone be in the same place most of the time.
                      
                  
      Netflix - Fulltime in Los Gatos, CAWe have a ton of positions open, but I'm looking for one in particular.  I'm hoping HN can help me come up with a good title for the position (We've been calling it Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) but the more people we talk to the more it sounds like that isn't quite right).  The job is:1/3 of the time you'll be either the call leader for an outage situation or following up on a previous outage to determine root cause and what can be done to prevent that class of failure in the future.1/3 of the you'll be working with teams throughout the company evangelizing best practices for reliability, scalability and distributed computing, such as helping them figure out caching strategies or how to use queues more effectively or avoiding global locks.The last 1/3 of your time will be spent coding (mostly in Python) writing tools that help maintain the reliability of Netflix.  Some tools we have written are an intelligent alert routing gateway, and tool to keep track or changes throughout the AWS environment, and simple tools like one that keeps track of EIP assignments or collects tcpdumps to send to Amazon.So HN, what do you think the title of this role should be?  Also, I didn't include the work DevOps in the description because it feels overused, but do you think it should be in there?
                      
                  
      "Outage Prevention Engineer/Manager/Director" sort of a cross between Clint Eastwood and Mr Spock :) - "site reliability" sort of minimizes the intense and adrenaline fueled hacking and debugging when "Bad Things(tm)" are happening, plus the authority to "encourage" changes.
                      
                  
      Sounds just like Google SREs. So seems to be a good fit yet.
                      
                  
      Interesting.  We interviewed a Google SRE and he said that what I described was nothing like the job he was doing.  I think one big difference is that at Netflix the SRE doesn't block deployments or roll them back.  We leave that up to the teams.
                      
                  
      "Neutered SRE", then. ;)Or, "Reliability Ombudsman".
                      
                  
      > "Neutered SRE", then. ;)Hah!  More like "respectful of the ability of our coworkers"> Or, "Reliability Ombudsman".I like this one.  Might just use it.
                      
                  
      I can appreciate "respect". Just don't fire the poor SOB when the service goes down because the people he works with ignored his warnings.

      Improbable worlds is a privately funded London based start up working on a transformative new underlying technology for online games.The team here is made up of some incredible young computer scientists from the best academic institutions, hedge funds and software houses in the country. We work primarily in Scala and C# on challenging greenfield problems in areas as distinct as distributed systems and procedural generation. The underlying technology is extremely exciting and the hope is that we can do certain things previously considered completely impossible in online experiences. We are also in talks with  AAA games talent from well known titles, with the intention of building  a game on top of our tech.As a working environment we offer a few golden principles that you might find very refreshing:Logic and careful thinking always trump seniority. Code quality matters just as much as productivity and much of the work here is challenging stuff nobody else has done before. 
Despite working on core tech, we get to build fun things! Working games and prototypes that stretch our platform and give core developers a chance to work with their own APIS. You even get to build cool stuff  in the interview :) ( Past candidates have created working train systems, pokemon clones, physical simulationsâ€¦.)We are still somewhat in stealth mode but are happy to provide more details during the process. If you are not uncomfortable with an exceptionally challenging interview process, keen to work on hard problems in a flat, peer led team, then please email Recruitment@improbableworlds.net.Also we are currently based in a mansion with a poolâ€¦. Happy to relocate good candidates from overseas.

      London, UK. Full time lead web application developer.Podaris is a funded startup that will change the way cities are designed. We're creating an online collaborative planning and design platform for next-generation Automated Transit Networks. Think TinkerCAD for future transport systems. Yes, there's a market for this: we've received our first seed investment and will soon receive more. I honestly don't think there's a more exciting use for Javascript on the planet.I'm looking for a technical co-founder / CTO / lead developer. Job description and more can be found at http://www.podaris.com/Unfortunately, as a startup, it is difficult for us to accommodate international relocations, so you must be an EU citizen or have a valid UK work permit.
                      
                  
      It does look interesting from here in the traffic-hell of Los Angeles.  Good luck.
                      
                  
      Administrate (http://www.getadministrate.com/) Edinburgh, Scotland. Full Time. Remote work OK after initial "break in" period.  We build online software for training companies that helps them run their entire operation.---------We're looking for a full time developer from our fantastic offices at the Edinburgh Tech Cube (http://www.techcu.be) with spectacular views of Arthur's seat and the Meadows.Remote work is fine after a "burn-in" period of a few months (we've got engineers happily working from Spain and Brazil at the moment) but we'd like to get to know you in person first!Detailed job description can be found on our about page (http://www.getadministrate.com/about), look on the lower right.We're using a combination of technologies:- Crufty old PHP (being refactored), and newer PHP (Doctrine)- All new development is being done with: Python, SQL Alchemy, Flask, and AngularJS using the Bootstrap UI frameworkWe're looking for smart people that get things done using the above techs, and who want to join a small company, have lots of responsibility, and work in a very challenging environment.------------If you're debating sending us your CV, we've hired two top devs from these threads in the last 6 months, and we don't mind hiring people who have never completed university or don't look great "on paper".We're growing really quickly, have a small team, a challenging product that's mission critical for our clients, and we're located in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with remote workers across the Central Belt of Scotland (and beyond).If you're outside the EU, we can look into visa sponsorship in very special cases, but this can be a long and difficult process, particularly for the UK. Sorry.  Email me if interested, my name is John: jjp@getadministrate.com
                      
                  
      Since you're open to remote employment, I guess that "break in" period could be done with a tourist visa ;)[and yes - you can pay after the person leaves and/or to the foreign bank account...]
                      
                  
      No, you need a National Insurance Number to work, you need to have permission to work in the UK to be paid.
                      
                  
      Is it generally hard to issue permission in UK, or this means that some particular company is not capable of doing it?
                      
                  
      It's pretty difficult.  There are only 20k slots released every year and you have to prove that nobody in the UK and then the greater EU can do the job.
                      
                  
      I see, 20K is pretty low. But regarding proving - I guess you'll only need to prove only within those who applied to your particular job posting (in case you want to pick "outsider" over UK citizen).And this procedure is a peace of cake for financial organizations/banks, as it seems.
                      
                  
      I'm a UK citizen, so I have no idea how hard it is.
                      
                  
      I can second the comments about Edinburgh I spent few months up there doing RAD and early web development for BT and its a great city.

      While I am still a student, I would love to give some feedback. I've found that when using your quiz feature, and you have to type the word or definition, you have to spell it correctly. I have found this as a huge problem when working with foreign languages, because I may not be used to spelling, so it count is wrong. If there is a way to implement some auto correct or spell check with words in the set, I would love that.
