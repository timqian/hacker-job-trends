      I think they may need to clean up or edit their Wikipedia page. For example, in the See Also section "Slacktivism" is one of the links and in general reading the page gives a pretty bad impression. I totally believe what you're saying but when someone (like me) who doesn't know anything about Avaaz and tries to get a third-party independent view of them it doesn't look pretty.

      Doximity (https://www.doximity.com) - San Fransisco, CA - Remote or Onsite - Permanent - Full TimeRuby on Rails engineers, preferably full stack and helps to have experience in Go and JavaScript.
https://doximity.theresumator.com/apply/jobs/details/I4u6BDDoximity's passion for working with physicians is what helped us grow to No 1. We believe that when doctors are connected, patients benefit and the medical sector works better. Listening to what physicians need and then building simple tools to solve complex problems is what we do. Our vision is a future where medical communication is effortless â€” fast, simple, seamless and secure.Doximity is made of developers, doctors, scientists, start-up founders, non-profit founders, ping-pong players, professional waterskiers. We're diverse - in fact, we're multilingual. Ruby is our preferred language, of course. While we're already the No. 1 network for physicians, we're not even close to being done with our goals.We talk about our technology on our blog:Engineering Stack: https://engineering.doximity.com/pages/engineering-stackOn-boarding: https://engineering.doximity.com/articles/software-engineeri...Automating Workflows: https://engineering.doximity.com/articles/automating-workflo...I'm involved in the hiring process, reach out to me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeybalachandran) or via e-mail at jbalachandran@doximity.com. You won't be talking to any recruiters :)Happy New Year,Jey Balachandran
                      
                  
      I'm working at Doximity with Rails and Go. Great team, interesting technical problems, and we actually make a difference in the medical care of others.Some physician testimonies:I was searching for clinical trials for one of my patients with severe eczema refractory to many therapies. In my search, I was referred to a nearby expert. Instead of calling the department, or trying to search through the many webpages of the hospital, I found the physician on Doximity and simply sent her a message via Doximity on my iPhone and got my patient set up with the clinical trial manager within a matter of hours. I had a young gentleman with a vague brain surgery history who was brought in to my community ER by ambulance. He had altered mental status so he was unable to give me any information on his condition or history. Luckily EMS said he had surgery at a neighboring academic center. I contacted medical records at the other hospital but they said there was no record of the patient. Using Doximity I snapped a photo of the patient's wristband and face sheet. Turns out his DOB was wrong. Medical records faxed back his records just in time for me to arrange transfer before the patient lost his airway.In addition to Jey, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/benmanns) or email at bmanns@doximity.com if you want a perspective from a remote engineer.
                      
                  
      I joined Doximity earlier this year as a remote developer and I couldn't be happier. It's really cool having a true SF startup experience while still being outside the Bay Area.If you're a Rails/JS developer out on the market, feel free to email me your resume and Github as well (skhan@doximity.com).Unlike most startups you read about on TechCrunch, Doximity is  already profitable and we're scaling fast (over 60% of US physicians on our medical network and 120+ people in the company). Our engineering team works hard at building software solutions for this lucrative market.Lots of very talented full-stack engineers on our team, as well as a team of data science experts. Great opp for any solid Rails/JS developers looking for a change.Sayem Khanhttp://linkedin.com/in/sayemkhan | http://github.com/sayem
                      
                  
      I have 2 questions:1) Are you open to developers outside the US? I'm currently in Poland.
2) I have programming and test automation experience, but with Ruby on Rails I'm just a beginner (I'm not using it at work, just for personal projects). Are you open to "Rails rookies" too?
                      
                  
      I've been at Doximity for over 5 years and can say it's an incredible company. Great team, challenging problems for a great cause.Feel free to contact me as well if you'd like to find out more, bmiranda@doximity.com

If you know a software engineer who fits, please direct them to jobs@phylagen.com.We are an energized team developing microbiome data analytic tools and bioinformatics pipelines that are being applied to a wide range of environments. We plan to bring on an innovative coder - with a B.S. or M.S in computer science, engineering, statistics, or bioinformatics (translating to 4-5 years software engineering experience). We want someone deeply knowledgeable in algorithm optimization, including parallelization, distributed execution and implementing methods. The position will entail combining code and data from different disciplines, translating and optimizing published research algorithms (e.g. created in R/Python/Julia) into industry products, and creating reference databases that can be used in machine learning applications. Expertise in the analysis of metagenomics data and bioinformatics pipelines is a bonus. We are looking someone who is flexible - a fast learner with relevant experience that will allow them to contribute quickly. You will be a key player in a cutting edge, rapidly growing venture-backed microbiome startup.Phylagen harnesses the vast, unseen world of microbes to improve our daily lives. The microbiome - the trillions of interacting bacteria, fungi, algae and viruses that inhabit every inch of our world - is the most complex, untapped dataset on earth. We combine advanced DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analytics with scalable, high performance computing to analyze the microbiome in ways previously not possible. This enables us to determine and interpret complex genetic signatures and provide a powerful new decision-making tool for businesses.
                      
                  
      Seattle, WA - REMOTE: Apsis Labs is looking to add our 4th engineer. We are a small design & development shop located in Seattle, WA, but work as a distributed team.

Read more about our job philosophy here: http://apsis.io/apsis/blog/2015/04/23/work-sustainably/.Questions, contact: jobs at apsis.io
                      
                  
      Your working philosophy is great! However, it's very difficult to determine from your web page what types of engineers you're looking for. Can you elaborate on the particular skill set you need, and a little on the primary technologies that a candidate should have in order to be relevant?
                      
                  
      Our approach to engineering is pretty utilitarian: we don't specialize in any specific technologies (though we do build a lot of Rails applications), instead we believe a good engineer will be capable of working on any stack. We look for candidates with solid fundamentals, and exceptional communication: because we're a small company, everyone here takes on a lot of roles, and strong relationships with our clients is absolutely essential to our success.If you're curious, capable, and intent on improving, we'd love to talk to you about what you might have to offer.
                      
                  
      Thank you for the reply! I appreciate the philosophy of hiring generally good people and letting them learn new stacks as needed. However, there's also something to be said for specialization. For example, I work in scientific computing and have never touched Rails. Even though I might be able to learn what you do, I think we'd both probably agree I'm not the right person for it -- so even just those few extra bits of info about Rails make it so much more efficient for both of us.

      Paris | API and/or Frontend developer ONSITE | Aldebaran Robotics (~450 employees)
https://www.aldebaran.com/en
(French speaker not mandatory)Technology: REST API/ angular / python / go / docker / AWSI'm the technical lead of the "cloud team" (~15 people), i.e we're the ones providing the REST services that our robots are using to provide analytics / error reporting and more, as well as the backend tools for our B2B customers, and last but not least the internal tooling to help manage our growing infrastructure.We're looking for people willing to join a young and dynamic team, either as a junior to learn with us on interesting subjects (high traffic services in the cloud generated by robots [insert more buzzword here]) or more senior profiles interested in providing us their experiences.Our stack is mainly composed of micro-services written in python (mostly django and tornado, though we may migrate to flask for some of them), and mysql (with an on going migration to postgresql) + cassandra for the databases, Kibana for the monitoring. 
For the devops part we're deploying on AWS with a nearly fully automated process (i.e we're not doing any manual command to provision our instances, like docker, but with AMI, hence our thought to migrate on docker in the near future).The skills we value the most is being curious, passionate about IT and willing  to learn, you don't know python but you understand the underlying concept of computer science, REST, then it's not a problem for us.As for the Salary, I'm not part of the HR team so I can't give any numbers except that we're on the average of the market and we can make exception.If you're interested please drop me a non-formal email, asimon@aldebaran.com  with a resume and all what you think necessary.Edit: I've forgotten to add that we're still in phase of experimentation and open to any technology stack that could be suitable for our needs, so it's not going to be 100% python if you convince us go, rust, haskell would be a pragmatic choice.

(I want the shared perspective).Looking for someone who has strong opinions on how to use devops, CI, and unit testing effectively, how to manage technical debt, and how to build reasonably scalable architectures while preserving developer productivity.Plan to be hands on with development in the early days, with potential to focus more on either leadership and mentoring or technical pathfinding and design as the project unfolds, depending on your inclination.I am the hiring manager.

You make computing enjoyable, an experience which is too often the opposite.We have a ton of interesting work to do and you'll be hard-pressed to find a team that cares more about making great products, or an environment more amicable to this kind of work.

This is a position where a portfolio speaks louder than any credentials. We want to see your work!(Note: this is _not_ a design position. We're evaluating the quality of the implementation, though of course it's impossible to entirely separate the two - like writing/acting).We'd also like to hear more about the projects you've worked on, what your role was, what went right/wrong, etc...

Maintain high output while pairing with junior teammates.email daniel.rondeau@pavlok.com and mention HN in the subject
                      
                  
      > At least 1 commit / hourSuch a vanity metric for productivity is a red flag, reminds me of the old school horror stories of managers so out of touch with software development that they recorded Lines of Code counts as a means of measuring performance.Curious as to the reasoning.
                      
                  
      Also find this hilarious in context with the other line that says "Maintain high output while pairing with junior teammates."I also greatly appreciate knowing when a role will involve pairing so I can steer clear of it. There are way more empowering ways to skill up junior programmers that don't involve wasting both engineers' time. Assign an achievable but not insignificant task, have a code review system set up, and have them frequently post reviews while they build their solution. The senior engineer can then do the whole mentor thing asynchronously and in response to actual issues the junior has, while the junior is then also allowed to make mistakes, struggle, and overcome issues him/herself.
                      
                  
      My experience is very different from yours.I've been spoilt by pairing, I no longer prefer to work solo.I've also seen organisations trying to substitute asynchronous code reviews for pairing. They aren't really substitutable. Just as pairing has antipatterns, so do code review systems.As an analogy, I've coached olympic-style weightlifting. The difference between coaching in person and coaching online is night and day. And coaching beginners pretty much demands fast feedback to be most effective.
                      
                  
      Performing the task of weightlifting is incredibly different than performing the task of programming. Much evidence suggests that programmers perform better solo because they can more easily reach states of psychological flow, and because they are less inhibited by social interactions which modulate certain parts of our thinking and can inhibit creativity, etc. At the very least, this is more highly true of introverted personality styles, and creating mandates for policies like pair programming is extremely insensitive (almost to a point of blatant discrimination) towards people with differing personality and learning styles.For me personally, I can't learn anything from other people saying stuff about it audibly. I have to read documentation or code. I am the weirdo who actually reads my car's maintenance manual to figure out how to change spark plugs or use the jack to lift the car when replacing a tire. Someone can tell me how to change a tire all day long and it just doesn't help at all. I even played quarterback on my high school football team and even at that I had to actually read books and biomechanics papers about the throwing motion before I really improved. I went to football camps and everything and it just did no good. For me, I really only absorb information when I literally tune out all audio (especially the sound of people talking) and read.I suppose I serve as something of a counter-example, then. Just because beginners in weightlifting (or any given activity) benefit most from fast, in-person feedback does not at all mean that beginners in some other activity (like programming) will also benefit from that kind of feedback.I've also worked in high pair-programming environments, in one case with a group of other experienced, extremely talented engineers, and in another case with a larger number of average to mediocre engineers.In both cases, across the board, pairing slowed us down and led to worker dissatisfaction. The few times when pairing came in handy were those cases when a person needed to begin working on a section of code or a subsystem that someone else had explicit experience with. Then, pairing them briefly (for, say, half a day) to force the novice to get up to speed quickly and have an "oracle" nearby was really helpful, but after about the 4 hour mark it just started slowing both people down, caused the novice to learn too slowly, and focused hyper amounts of attention on issues that wouldn't have needed to be brought up if the novice instead focused on solving their own problems and boiling down their issue list into a smaller, asynchronous list of just the most urgent needs.And, truly, the only reason that those first four or so hours of pairing worked at all is that the documentation for the code was poor. If the exact questions and answers that were discussed during pairing had instead been turned into an internal StackOverflow and/or an internal quick start guide, it would have helped far more people get up to speed far more quickly than pairing, while only costing the senior dev a single up front cost.Pairing is the definition of an activity that doesn't scale, and is arguably less beneficial than well written user guides + StackOverflow-like tools that allow for documenting the learning process.
                      
                  
      > Pivotal LabsThat explains it. We're lucky this thread was merely about pair programming and not about the orders-of-magnitude worse phenomenon of Agile/Scrum.
                      
                  
      Again, my experience has been different to yours.Though we might have some opinions about scrum in common.
                      
                  
      I also just wanted to clarify about scaling: taking some (semi-large) number like 120 and claiming this means "pairing does scale" seems totally wrong to me."Scaling" does not refer to taking some large number and dividing it by 2 (120 engineers -> 60 pairs; 1200 engineers -> 600 pairs). That is emphatically not scaling.Scaling is about leveraging the expertise of one of your most dramatically productive engineers by dispersing that person's help, wisdom, advice, etc., to more than one other person at a time.Pairing doesn't scale precisely because the best person you have can only assist the exact same number of people that the worst person you have can also assist (namely, 1 in each case, since they are both part of a pair).And, as Brooks noted long ago in The Mythical Man-Month, adding more people to a given task often just slows it down. Communication overhead tends to grow as O(n^2) or worse. So if you generalize a "pair" into a "triple" or a n-tuple, the process of pairing suddenly no longer helps and often dramatically hurts.So when I say, "pairing doesn't scale," what I mean is that the best it can ever provide you is a 2x improvement in information transmission (and often it's far worse than that, and in all the cases I've seen it used first-hand it has actually been less than 1x).I think it's a little disingenuous to just say, "Hey, we did it with 120 people! So it scales!" That's just not what scaling is about.By way of comparison, one single, well-written quick-start guide can have almost an arbitrarily large improvement factor in terms of information transmission. You can hire one engineer who is good enough to write that document, and then send it to all of the other 119 engineers.In my experience, even if that document is just so-so, it's still miles better than having to mentally context switch out of coding mode and into social conversation mode every few seconds to elicit the same info verbally out of a pairing partner sitting with me.
                      
                  
      As I said further up, nothing about pairing precludes any other channel of communication.When I need to learn about a tool or system built by anyone else, the docs are the first place I look. If that doesn't help, I reach out for help.> So if you generalize a "pair" into a "triple" or a n-tuple, the process of pairing suddenly no longer helps and often dramatically hurts.Nothing about pairing changes the number of people in a project, or the number of potential pathways between them (some might argue that it halves the paths, but that would be twisting the meaning of pathways).As I said above, we use pretty ordinary tactics to manage building large distributed systems, such as breaking them down into human-sized chunks of functionality that interact in limited ways.If you like, I can ask about having you visit an office. It probably won't change your mind, but if you see something we don't, that's useful and valuable feedback.
                      
                  
      I think you misunderstood what I meant.In pairing, a bi-directional pathway is established between Person A and Person B. This means that, during the activity of pairing, Person A's influence is exclusively dedicated to Person B, and vice versa. If everyone working solo is the baseline, meaning everyone only has the "1x influence" of their own work, then switching to pairing (if it works) increases this to 2x -- yourself and the pair partner.In a traditional meeting where Person A is the speaker and there are N-1 audience members, Person A's influence is equally effective (ideally) across all N-1 unidirectional communication channels. If Person A is a really great engineer, from whom the other N-1 can all learn a lot, then leveraging just Person A at a factor of N-1 could be vastly more powerful than leveraging everyone but only at a factor of 2.When you say things like:> Nothing about pairing changes the number of people in a project, or the number of potential pathways between them (some might argue that it halves the paths, but that would be twisting the meaning of pathways).it makes me think you misunderstood me, because I never claimed that pairing changes the number in a project or anything else.However, you can't deny that in an environment where pairing is the expected modality for collaborative work, there truly is an emphasis on precisely the N=2 case, and other forms of communication necessarily have to be reduced to allow for pairing time and consistency in the act of pairing. It's not possible to do all other modes of communication and also pairing, because when you're pairing, you're necessarily not doing the other modes of communication.My statements are about inherent limits to pairing. You can't extend the concept of pairing (based on 2 people) to triples, 4-tuples, and so on, without it leading to O(n^2) communication problems (e.g. if you tried to put 25 people together in one "mega pair-like group" it would be a big mess).This is a bad property of pairing; exactly equivalent to saying that it does not scale.I think the better way of phrasing it from my earlier remark was this:When Person A is pairing with Person B, Person A is necessarily limited to only helping 1 person. If Person A is your best engineer, this is really bad. Telling Person A to stop doing pairing and to instead do all the same advice/Q&A tasks that would have been done during pairing and do them in some other way that scales (like user guides and SO) would immediately be better.You can't have it both ways. At a certain moment in time when your best person is engaged in pairing, it necessarily means your best person is being wasted by having merely a 2x impact, instead of being pulled out of pairing and placed into some other activity that has a much higher factor of impact.In real life, you'll never do any of these things perfectly, pairing or not pairing. But the point is that pairing is inherently not scalable, not even in principle.It has nothing at all to do with whether your team also writes user guides or also answers questions on an internal SO site when they are not in the act of pairing. It's about the opportunity cost when they are in the act of pairing.
                      
                  
      Do the people who think like seriously imagine that this is something reasonable and expectable, and not totally subjective to the style and habits of individual developers? I'm always baffled by managers or business people who seem to think quantification of productivity is easy. They must be incredibly lazy to not want to invest themselves in understanding what their developers are doing to gauge productivity themselves. Is this a sign of horrible management, or at least, as you say it, management that has become horribly out of touch with their developers?

      Ha, would be funny if the internal setup were like that.I wouldn't be too quick to assume bad faith on the companies part though. Sometimes agile companies have these vanity metrics as a proxy to keep their development environments and processes in check. (ie: are things set up well enough with a fast test suite so that developers are comfortable committing/pushing/deploying frequently with confidence?)That's why I phrased it as a query as to the reasoning behind the metric as it could be easily read as the company using a poor performance metric.
                      
                  
      For a lot of companies, it's important to signal that they're even thinking about something. Like whether a new hire feels like they've contributed anything during the onboarding period.

      Note the 1 commit per hour is just for the first 14 days. We do that so new devs just know how to use our system and get coordinated in our system. The commits don't always need to have major changes, and often is always branched for the user.
