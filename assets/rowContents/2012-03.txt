I have a plea for those posting: Please tell me what you do so I know if that's something I'm interested in.Example (not personal, you were just the top post right now): "Etsy.com is hiring all kinds of positions from engineering to design to marketing. Come join an awesome team..."  I have no idea what you do or why that should interest me.As opposed to: "Lot18 (http://www.lot18.com) is revolutionizing the way people buy wine and epicurean products online." Thank you, now I know whether I should continue reading based on whether that's something that interests me.
                      
                  
      It's a filtering mechanisim.  If you aren't familiar with Etsy, then you probably aren't the person they're looking for.Much like with reddit, we posted the jobs on the blog because we wanted people familiar with the site.
                      
                  
      With all due respect, I'm not sure there's a correlation between being familiar with <insert_your_startup_here> and being the kind of person said startup is looking for. It's your prerogative, of course, but that sort of filtering doesn't seem very optimal to me. Shouldn't you want to inform people of the awesome and important work you're doing?
                      
                  
      Whoops, sorry about that!  Totally fair criticism.  I wasn't thinking that deeply about it, just quickly adding to the page.  And though we do love people who are familiar with Etsy and are into the mission, it's certainly not a requirement.For those who are unfamiliar (since I can no longer edit my post below): Etsy is the global handmade marketplace.  Our mission is to empower people to change the way the global economy works. We see a world in which very-very small businesses have much-much more sway in shaping the economy, local living economies are thriving everywhere, and people value authorship and provenance as much as price and convenience. We are bringing heart to commerce and making the world more fair, more sustainable, and more fun.  As I mentioned below, tons more info and positions at http://www.etsy.com/careers, as well as contact info in my profile for any questions you may have.

      I'm mildly curious why this one is down voted. No link?
                      
                  
      Accidental downvotes are a lot more common on HN than you might imagine. The arrows are really small and close together, especially on an iPhone. I'd guess that's what happened.

We know how to process data efficiently and at an enormous scale. We apply the same principles of dealing with market data to other sectors such as government, law, and even sports.

We run one of the largest private networks in the world and connect to more primary data sources than anyone else.

      For developers, except for working in one of the infrastructure teams at Bloomberg, I heard its like going backwards. Most developers are app developers and do CRUD apps with crappy proprietary technologies and all this has to be done in tight deadlines. :) Heard from 1st, 2nd and 3rd sources.
                      
                  
      There are roughly 3,000 people in R&D. I'm sure there are plenty of jobs in that number that are not my cup of tea. That's why I choose to work on hard problems with awesome people instead and I'm always looking for people who want the same.
                      
                  
      From 2 internships, that's not at all a fair reflection. There are some awesome opportunities at BB and there are some issues too. It's got some old code, but the good things far outway the occasional collision with Fortran.
                      
                  
      Could you please inform me if John Lakos's and/or Alisdair Meredith's teams are hiring and how to find these job postings?
                      
                  
      We're all under the infrastructure umbrella.. I checked and there are no specific postings on the web for John's team, but that doesn't mean he won't interview qualified candidates. E-mail me your resume/info and I'll give it to him.

      San Jose, CA - Milo.com, part of eBayMilo's goal is to list every product on every shelf in every store. We have a noble goal of trying to help shoppers find products in store. Surprisingly, the vast majority of people still do most of their shopping in stores and we help them shop wisely. How? We show you the different pricing options and the distances to stores so you can decide if it is cost- and time-effective to go shop at a local store or use other options. In my opinion, we complement eBay shopping pretty well.I joined this team as a data engineer a few months back and really enjoy the work environment. We still retain the startup culture (read more on the website) and also get the benefits of the larger company (eBay), which includes technical expertise and operational support.We are currently looking for data engineers (and quite a few other positions as well). I work on the data team and we get to do a variety of interesting and technically challenging projects. You get to learn how the different pieces of the puzzle fit together and interact with different teams. I have the joy of working with some really smart people. I can honestly say, I look forward to going to work every day after having worked from home for the past couple of years at my previous job.But, I have to warn you, once you get a taste of Milo, you may not want to go anywhere else...Oh... and we mainly use Python and we are going to Pycon as well. Check out the website for more: http://milo.com/jobsPS. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions.

      Yammer is hiring engineers in SF and London, and a bunch of other non-engineering positions in London/NYC/AUS/elsewhere. Full jobs listing at https://www.yammer.com/jobsYammer is basically a social network for the enterprise, but Yammer isn't just where you talk about work, it's increasingly where you do work.Large corporations are really inefficient and hierarchical and Dilbert-y, and we build software that treats every employee as an empowered human being. We have a success-story video on our site from Supervalu, a large retail store chain in the US, and their CTO tells a story about how Yammer literally changed the way they do business. In the old world, store managers would report their intelligence up the managerial chain, the upper management would try to synthesize everything, and 3 months later a "report" would be issued that told everyone how to best try to do their jobs. After Yammer, store managers would just talk to each other over Yammer, learn directly what was successful and what wasn't, and as a side effect, let the upper management gain invaluable visibility into day-to-day operations. When we say Yammer "breaks down silos" and "enables horizontal communication", this is what we mean. Sure, Yammer is just like Facebook, but we're so much more than that. Corporations don't share cat pictures, they turn into efficient business machines.Supervalu testimonial video: https://www.yammer.com/customers
In fact, Supervalu isn't the only company that has changed the way they work due to Yammer. We have tons of examples at that link. Yammer is used by 85% of the Fortune 500.Yammer is expanding. We just raised an 85MM round, reflecting a valuation that puts on right up there in the enterprise software space. We're growing quickly and we need strong capable solid engineers to help us. We have an excellent technical platform but we need to scale more. This is where you come in. We're looking for engineers of all stripes, be it Ruby/Rails, JS/Node, Java/Scala, Obj-C/iOS/Android, or other. Again, full list at https://www.yammer.com/jobsIf you're remotely interested in solving real engineering problems at scale, for a serious application, I urge you to get in touch. My email is bkudria@yammer-inc.com, and you can ask me any questions about Yammer that you'd like.
                      
                  
      To give you an example of the sort of stuff we do behind the scenes at Yammer, here's what my team has shipped:* a realtime message delivery service which handles hundreds of thousands of concurrent clients* an activity stream data store serving just shy of a billion requests a day* a distributed database serving well over a billion requests a day over tens of terabytes of data with ~10ms response times at the 99th percentile* a realtime search indexing pipeline, complete with a denormalized entity store, index replication and an autocompletion service* a data export service which basically performs a diff of the state of millions of business objects and sends it out as a streaming ZIP file* a user account synchronization service which handles streaming JSON dumps of companies' LDAP/AD server data* an affinity prediction service which provides ranking of arbitrary objects based on past interactions (e.g., who you're most likely to CC on a message)* an OAuth2 token service for 4MM users* a collection service for the user events pipeline of our analytics system, handling hundreds of thousands of user events a second* plus a grip of open-source librariesAnd this is a team of seven people (now). The other teams at Yammer ship just as much as we do.

      Amsterdam, Netherlands, Part/Full-time, remote work possible.
--------------------The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is looking for an experienced developer in one or more: Ruby, Rails, Javascript (jQuery, backbone.js, CoffeeScript, etc). You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.We answers questions like: "If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.Reactions to: dennis@quintel.com

      I don't mean to be rude, but I had taken some valuable time to apply, just to be sent a canned email saying that "internship selections are over". In that light, can you justify advertising that you are still accepting interns?
                      
                  
      If you didn't get an interview, you should have received the message, "[We] do not have an open slot in our current slate" â€“ sorry that we weren't able to offer you an interview, but best of luck with your search for an internship.

This is an amazing opportunity for someone who wants to have a large amount of responsibility and say in not only what is built, but how we go about building it (Lean + sprint.ly + validation === fun).Currently the stack includes a custom build of Nginx, PHP5.3 (lithium), MongoDB, Redis, memcached combo, and that grows as our needs will. Local sandboxes are configured using Chef, Vagrant, VirtualBox, git - and it comes with a MBP w/ display(s) of your choosing to boot.If you're passionate and smart (and know Python/Java), there's going to be a huge opportunity for some serious data analysis, recommendation and visualization as we build out our discovery engine based on the huge amounts of manifests, trade documents, behavioral and product data that we aggregate from and about our industry.We're funded, we're growing, we enjoy working with each other (but we like to go home at the end of the day as well), and we'd love to hear from you.techjobs@tigertrade.com

Causes - http://www.causes.com/joinus
At Causes, use your programming powers to help nonprofits effect change on the world! Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 10-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc.Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from- every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer- actively upgrading our version of Rails, and not stopping until we hit bleeding edge. We hit Rails 2.3.14 last week and hope to hit 3.0.11 within the month- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselvesCauses is a great place to better yourself and better the world.

      San Francisco/Remote - Seeking Full Time - Designer and iOS & Web DevelopersEmbarkAir is looking for great people. Today, we are building the best way to book a flight on your phone. We've taken the arduous process of today that requires 8 screens and 31 actions and reduced it to 4 beautiful screens and 8 simple touches. See the app at http://embarkair.com. But the vision for tomorrow is to allow people to be productive anywhere. To do what RIM originally did for email for all common tasks. And what the iPhone did for the mobile web. We believe phones will soon become our primary devices, yet many tasks are still too difficult to complete on a phone today. There is too little personalization, too much data for the little screens and too many steps to complete a transaction.Booking a flight is the first task we have solved and the big vision is to build a platform that is the best way to complete complex tasks. Period. Our beta testers love the app and booking experience and we are gearing up for a wider release in the near future.I'm looking for a lead designer -- someone with a keen eye and experience creating clean simple interfaces. Our focus is on eliminating steps and reducing the number of touches -- while making information  clear and easy to digest.I'm also looking for an iOS or backend developer -- someone with experience developing in iOS, an interest in simplicity and creating beautiful interactions and a snappy app. On the backend, we are a python shop -- nginx, tornado, mysql. Someone that likes to get their hands dirty working with 3rd party APIs and optimizing for speed!We are offering a decent salary, significant equity and a chance to lead this new company.To learn more and apply please email me at wferrell@embarkair.com

      Hey guys, long time no see (we met last summer).Have you ever considered using your sort of opinion-measurement tech to build a disruptive electoral system?
                      
                  
      Madison, WI, USA - Linux Operator (fulltime, no remote)I'm leaving my awesome job in the University of Wisconsin Department of Physics at the end of this month and I want you to take over.Our group operates a large (>=1PB disk, >=2500 cores) analysis facility that physicists from Wisconsin and around the world use to search for the Higgs boson (we're part of the CMS collaboration at the LHC). We work with peers at universities across the US and Europe to provide dozens of PB and millions of hours of computing each day. We write programs, share our code, optimize systems, distribute computing and occasionally rack hardware.We like Python, Perl, Mercurial, shell tricks, SSH, Jabber, Ganglia, Apache and Nginx, Varnish and Squid, Scientific Linux (it's like Centos), APIS, (more) metrics, (fewer) alerts, CFEngine, Hadoop, Condor, KVM and libvirt, AFS and FUSE. We're reflexively open:    http://hg.hep.wisc.edu/
    http://ganglia.hep.wisc.edu/ganglia

You don't need to have worked with many or any of the above, but you're excited about learning (or teaching us why your way works better). You're familiar with running a Linux system and wonder what breaks when you run hundreds of them. Repetitive tasks irritate you; open-ended problems pique your interest. You look forward to learning from colleagues with deep knowledge of C and systems programming; distributed computing; statistics and data analysis; and Indian food. You've been looking for a job where you're free to choose the right tech for the problem at hand and you itch to justify the choice empirically. Most of all, you're curious.The position hasn't yet been officially listed, but I'd love to talk to you. Please feel free to email me at wcmaier@hep.wisc.edu or grab me on IRC (lt_kije on freenode). If you're a student, we'll take you on as a student hourly until you graduate. Otherwise, the university only likes to hire people with a BS/BA.

Our clients range from large public companies to startups, non-profits and government agencies. On any given day, we work on projects ranging from building creative new web and mobile experiences, to launching startups for clients, to helping clients understand and plan for adoption of new interactive technologies. We are, in essence, one part technology specialist, one part interactive agency, and one part business model incubator.We like to work on things that matter with people who care.About the positionYou'll be tasked with building important systems for interesting clients, with plenty of technical challenges and opportunities to learn as you go. You'll work in a Scrum team, primarily in PHP to start - you'll also likely learn how to build complex systems in Drupal through our 2 month intensive training program with world re-known Drupal experts.About youA background in Computer/Software Engineering or Computer Science is strongly preferred, but we're open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a nonconventional degree. We're looking for 1-2yrs experience (if you're fresh out of school get in touch anyway). Double points if you have startup experience.
We mostly work in PHP, but diverse language experience is a plus. It's more important that you're smart and driven than that you're a PHP expert.
