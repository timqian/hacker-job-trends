Hey, a friendly reminder. Iâ€™m parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map onhttps://whoishiring.ioor just HN itemshttps://whoishiring.io/search/36.0440/-90.8984/4?source=hnIf you post here, please use the below format to help me with parsing. If you wonâ€™t, no worries, I will do my best to get all the things right.  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, company url}
  Google | Software Developer | SF | VISA https://google.com
  DuckDuckGo | Software Developer | Paoli PA | REMOTE, VISA
or  2) {company} | {job title} | {location}
  Google | Site Reliability Engineer | London, Zurich, Sydney
  Facebook | Web-developer | London, Zurich

Iâ€™m using this regex to test the firstline.  \s*(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s*(?:\|\s*(?P<attrs>.+))?$

You can test it in Python or here https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/3 (for the match look right).
                      
                  
      In that spirit, I wanted to mention a similar project I have been working on for past few weeks:https://firstdevjob.comIt's specifically aimed at helping people find their very first dev job (mainly for people who are trying to transition into tech). Right now there are three parts that help with different aspects of the process:- jobs: jobs for junior positions(through AngelList, HN etc.)- posts: knowledge in the form of articles. (from learning to code to interview prep)- stories: interviews of people who have successfully made the career switch to developmentIf you are a developer who is looking for his first(or maybe 2nd?) developer job, I would love to have your feedback!
                      
                  
      Thank you for this! I coming up on graduation and am looking for my first job. Perhaps I am a narrow use case, but I would like to see a distance slider for the filter; I am looking to relocate to the SF area but I really don't care what city it is.Also, it would be nice to see a little bit of information underneath the posting before you view the full ad: maybe show the "skills" section from AngelList?Again, thanks! I already applied to FormSwift through your site.
                      
                  
      Awesome! Hope you get an offer from there :-)Both your points make sense. Reg distance slider - do you think option to input state can be an alternative? Would that work for you?
                      
                  
      Personally, they both make sense to me. I've always seen a slider option but I'm sure it's more work to implement. State could be an easy way to search on a bigger scope.I feel like you would have to ask yourself how most people use these features: perhaps someone is searching for the city they live in and are willing to commute "30 miles." They certainly wouldn't want to search the entire state of Texas. Is that the major use-case for users of your site? Forgive me if I'm using an incorrect logic here as I have never done user interface testing but this seems like the sort of thing to think about when designing features.Honestly though I love the simplicity in design of your site, but the way your job-tile elements are created they're just begging to be clicked on to expand them for more detail.
                      
                  
      Great user interface points, and not just because they match your current need.
                      
                  
      I am looking for junior roles available immediately but finding difficulties due to two things : -
(1) Many jobs have work authorizations issue.
(2) Many job boards require experience to qualify.
                      
                  
      Looks great , but some openings need someone with 4 years experience. That doesn't sound like entry level stuff.
                      
                  
      Sorry about that. And thank you for pointing it out!It's really annoying when the title says junior and then description asks for few years experience. We are working hard to prevent such cases.
                      
                  
      Please reachout for opening in junior role at printdhruv@yahoo.com
Web: www.rundhruv.com
Looking for immediate consideration
work authorization : CPT/OPT
                      
                  
      I like the premise, but maybe next time you talk about it say'If you are a developer who is looking for your first(or maybe 2nd?) developer job, I would love to have your feedback!'No need for gendered pronouns in a general description.
                      
                  
      Could you also add a tag/filter for remote jobs? Thanks.
                      
                  
      Honestly, your first dev job should probably NOT be remote.
                      
                  
      Thank you so much for making this. I graduated in December and I've been having a rough time finding all of the junior positions that more obscure companies may be offering.EDIT: Also as a suggestion, it would be cool to filter by full-time/part-time/contract if possible
                      
                  
      I just tried the search and couldn't seem to get any results to appear for Seattle. I tried "Seattle", "Seattle, United States", and "Washington" and the top result was never a job in Seattle or in Washington. Now it's certainly possible there's no jobs listed in Seattle however I don't see how I would be able to check. So my feedback is this, maybe give some thought on the way you'd like to handle queries that don't have any matches rather than what appears to be random listings when it occurs.Edit: Appears to be working correctly now.
                      
                  
      Nice site. It could do with some language processing like stemming so searches for "algorithm" and "algorithms" give the identical results.
                      
                  
      Works great for me! I'm looking to work with multiple pythons, not just 1 snake.
                      
                  
      Adding to my notes from 2 months ago:* I add ONSITE because I used to get asked every time whether remote was supported.Previously: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13302035(Edited to reflect what I wrote previously, I hadn't checked)
                      
                  
      Looking at it on mobile, all of the jobs in the Philly region are crowded out by NYC. They might be close by West Coast standards, but are very much two different places for those who live here.(It shows 59 jobs in PA, most of which seem to be NYC jobs.)
                      
                  
      Don't forget that there's "Who wants to get hired": https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13764730
                      
                  
      Does anyone ever get quality responses from that thread?Maybe I'm cynical, but I've been hesitant to post there with reservations about poor-quality leads and spending time dealing with them.
                      
                  
      I've never gotten many leads there, but the ones I've gotten have been high-quality.
                      
                  
      There were comments that including salary range was preferred. Have you thought of adding that to your format string? I've just updated our posting to match the string (1) but that required removing the salary range.
                      
                  
      Salaries will appear as a filter soon, hopefully before next edition. I get this request a lot.For now you can keep salary in the first line in {attrs} section for, or somewhere below the first line.What kind of the format you would like to see for salaries?
                      
                  
      I think a range would be sufficient. An optional currency symbol for multi location posts.location | [xxx to yyy]location | [US$xxx to yyy]
                      
                  
      Looks like the 'remote' thing doesn't work properly. There are remote jobs that aren't displayed when the 'remote' toggle is checked.
                      
                  
      That is not ok. Could you give me an example? I will try to fix it
                      
                  
      The problem is that the filter still uses the map when REMOTE is checked. This forces us to scroll around the map to view remote jobs.Best to disable the map when REMOTE is checked.
                      
                  
      I would actually prefer for remote jobs to keep their location data, if provided; I want to be able to view remote jobs in my country, so I don't have to worry about eligibility.
                      
                  
      Sure.1. Check 'remote', and I get a single job (Automation dev, Dublin, Ireland)2. Uncheck 'remote', zoom right out 75 jobs off the coasts of Ghana & Gabon, all listed as remote.
                      
                  
      Ok I seehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_IslandI've decided to leave them there. Since I can't figure where to put them on the map, the address in most of them is "remote".
                      
                  
      It was more that they don't show up when toggling the 'remote' setting, but up to you.
                      
                  
      Similar result for me if I put the term remote in the first input box. I get a job in London, England but nothing else. HTH
                      
                  
      Very nice.  May I suggest not mapping "Remote" jobs to the town of Remote, Oregon?  :-)
                      
                  
      Just a heads-up, you aren't marking up email addresses where the username contains a period correctly. The link presented on your site (nifty, btw) ignores everything before the period.
                      
                  
      Can the admin make this the preferred format and include it in the question itself? and perhaps move this comment down so that it won't push down the rest of thread.
                      
                  
      Hey, it'd be quite helpful if we could use multiple locations to search. ie "SF+Seattle" or "SF, Seattle".
                      
                  
      I just see an entirely blank white page. with `SecurityError: The operation is insecure.` in the console.
                      
                  
      It looks like something related LocalStorage in browsers. I'm logging those events with Sentry. For now it looks like I have 3 events like this from FF.I will see what I can do about it.

      Knack | Software Engineer | Remote | REMOTE https://knack.comHmm, let's see, how can we scare off the typical HN reader. We're bootstrapped, so we have zero interest in Silicon Valley. We're a 100% remote company, but we have overlap time and synchronous communication, because those things matter. Our only investors are our customers, so everything revolves around them, not you. And we're not looking to sell or be acquired, because, shocker, we actually love what we're doing and who we're doing it with and want to keep doing it forever.On the off chance there's a kindred spirit here, find out more at https://knack.com/work-at-knack
                      
                  
      I'm sure you meant this to be tongue-in-cheek, but it comes off as a very superior and passive aggressive attitude. I recommend a different approach if you're trying to get people interested in learning more.
                      
                  
      What's passive about it? ;)If we can spark a connection with a potential fit we're fine turning off everyone else.

      Totally disagree. Don't project :)
                      
                  
      It would be helpful if you could give some detail regarding what your company does and the skills for which you're looking.

      Oh yeah? Thanks for your only comment after 1,861 days in HN.This recruiter ignored me last month completely. He only responded until I posted this public comment on HN.
He sent me a coding test, which I completed successfully as reported by the online testing platform.
Few days passed without any feedback, so I sent him another email to remind him, and he replied with copypasta
that I'm rejected.He treats candidates with some sort of bias, rather than their skills. Don't waste your time.
                      
                  
      I don't know, man. I did not have the same experience as you

      CyVerse | DevOps Engineer | Tucson, AZ | https://cyverse.orghttps://uacareers.com/postings/9869CyVerse is an NSF-funded project building cloud platforms for biosciences research. As a DevOps Engineer on the Core Services team, you'll work with me to build and manage the systems that run Atmosphere (http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere) -- think "virtual Linux workstations for research scientists". Some technologies you'll work with are GNU+Linux, OpenStack, Ansible, and Python. Our web application is written in Django and React.We also support one of the world's largest iRODS deployments (http://irods.org), and are in the early stages of implementing Ceph for block storage. We have an exciting feature roadmap for the next year, and need a strong generalist sysadmin/developer to help us deliver valuable tools to our community.Everything that we build is released to the world under a BSD license -- look up our GitHub orgs (cyverse, iplantcollaborativeopensource, and cyverse-ansible). We sit next to a team of science analysts and have plenty of opportunities to help our users get the most from our services. We work in a beautiful, modern building at the University of Arizona (http://bio5.org/). As university employees we have great benefits and work-life balance. Tucson is a wonderfully livable Southwestern city with a growing tech/software/research community and plenty of things to do outside.
                      
                  
      What's the salary ballpark range? I'm an experienced SW developer in Tucson and I find this position very interesting.
                      
                  
      You can find University of Arizona salaries here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17bMR5x7I13fd6-7Yv-l_...Look for "iplant" and "bio5".
                      
                  
      Good lord there are assistant professors who make north of 300k? I had no idea!
                      
                  
      What peterebailey said.Ceteris paribus, someone who finds our projects, technologies, and public service mission compelling would be a better fit than someone trying to maximize salary potential.Also, for those new to Tucson, look up the cost of living. I spend just 7% of my pre-tax salary on housing.
                      
                  
      Just provide a range when candidates ask please. Its perfectly reasonable and the whole "we only want passionate rockstars that understand we are saving the world" farce is unprofessional.
                      
                  
      Understood -- I'm not a hiring manager, just trying to get the word out for an open position on my team.I am told "the minimum salary is $65k", and peterebailey's comment links to a spreadsheet listing the actual salaries of myself and all of my colleagues (as we are public employees). Hopefully that is sufficient.
                      
                  
      This is really interesting. Do you sponsor visas?
                      
                  
      I asked my director: "Yes we will sponsor visas to the right candidates".

      I think people downvote when they see "no remote" or similar. I really wish the admins turned off voting in this thread.
                      
                  
      The correct way to indicate that is "onsite". "No remote" makes it show up in the various scrapers for remote jobs.
                      
                  
      I didn't downvote so I don't know why people are doing it directly but I just checked and Squarespace has a very low glassdoor rating. Similar to that of Theranos before the scandals. There might be some hints there.
                      
                  
      3.8/5 is very low? Seems pretty normal to me.
                      
                  
      s/no remote/ONSITE/ is probably some of the downvotes
                      
                  
      Yeah, it was too late to edit by the time someone made that comment, unfortunately.
                      
                  
      Spire Global | Senior Software Engineer | SF, Boulder, Glasgow, Singapore | Full-time | On-siteSpire is a satellite-powered data company building out the full pipeline from custom spacecraft to data and analytics products. You can read a little more at http://spire.com or in the news.I'm looking for experienced software engineers with systems experience to lead teams and architect existing and new systems. Our stack is primarily Python, Linux, and C, but we have plenty of variety, and care less about a language or framework and more about building systems that last.
If you want to learn a little more, e-mail me (Robert) at rdeaton@spire.com with questions.
We have a variety of other roles as well, including Electrical, FPGA and DSP engineers, DevOps, Satellite Operators, Business Development and Sales, which I'm happy to answer questions about or refer you to the right person. https://spire.com/careers/openings/ .
                      
                  
      I'm pretty interested in the FPGA/DSP and firmware engineer jobs, and I'm based out of the Boulder, CO area. Any chance you'd consider hiring somebody into that office?
                      
                  
      Is the Sr. Software job in Glasgow?  Would love to visit the city but not sure that USians can work there easily.
                      
                  
      US isn't the easiest place to hire from Glasgow, but we've had pretty good success getting visas for US citizens to work in the UK.The job is whereever we can hire for it realistically, with priority order being Glasgow > SF > other offices.
                      
                  
      Do Spire ever hire Contractors in Glasgow?
                      
                  
      We hire contractors infrequently, as onboarding in most areas is pretty expensive. Contractors would usually be used for small, self-contained projects.

      Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) is hiring hackers (San Francisco, ONSITE)Y Combinator has a very big vision. This recent article talks about our plans to build a 21st century university: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-man...Here's a secret most people don't know: software is at the core of our plans for how to do this.We're looking for a couple of great hackers to join a small team in San Francisco. It's not a job for everyone, but it would be a good fit for someone who loves startups. Working at YC, you won't just write code, you'll be involved in everything YC does, from our dinner talks to demo day.Here's an example of something interesting we built recently: http://themacro.com/articles/2016/08/investor-day-software/If you're a hacker, send us a note here: http://bit.ly/1Od0T2l.  You can also email me with questions: jared@ycombinator.com
                      
                  
      I interviewed with Jared. We had a 30 or 40 minute phone call, during which he told me he wanted me to stop by their office to meet the following week, and then I never heard from Jared again. I emailed him, and never received a reply.I hope others have a better experience.
                      
                  
      I had a very good experience. I spoke with a member of the team and emailed a bit with Jared. He was completely transparent about timeframes (YC was interviewing for the W17 batch and they were slammed so he told me there would be a two week delay). I heard back from him shortly after their YC interviews completed and went onsite to meet the team.He was always prompt and respectful of my time.

      David | San Francisco, CA | https://www.senddavid.com | FullÂ­time | OnsiteDavid is a San Francisco-Â­based software startup that combines technology and legal research to help customers resolve disputes with their cable, internet, or wireless service provider. The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 / hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them. The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.We currently have a MVP (https://www.senddavid.com) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80Â­-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-Â­4.0% | https://angel.co/david-174/jobs/72943-engineerContact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com

Engineers have room to make decisions, move fast, and the encouragement to make things better. It's exciting.
                      
                  
      I've interviewed with Skyscanner (hackerrank, then skype, then onsite in Edinburgh) last year and had extremely positive impressions about process and company.After each interview where people were involved they gave very detailed feedback and interviewers were very positive and knowledgeable.
                      
                  
      I had the same experience, very nice people. I had one bad interview which probably cost me, but overall they take good care and leave a very positive impression
                      
                  
      I had the opposite experience. First a phone interview, then HackerRank which was much easier than they made it out to be (definitely didn't require any knowledge about algorithms and data structures), then another phone interview with mostly the same content as the first one but more inane questions like "name a project where you made an impact", then I got rejected because they had "no openings in my seniority". Pretty frustrating.
                      
                  
      Did you join the company as well?
