SEC $120,000 - $155,000
New YorkWe're building the SEC's next generation analytic platforms to keep our markets safe, effective, and trusted. Come build state-of-the-art tools to analyze big data within the High Frequency Trading arena. We do quantitative analysis, machine learning, plus good old fashioned product development.

You will own the front end of the application and be focused on data visualization and creating a GUI. While we donâ€™t need a graphic designer, some design sense will be a huge asset for creatively displaying data in clear and meaningful ways. Your visualizations will be used to enforce the law on big firms trading within the markets.The development tools we are interested in are: D3, Highcharts, React, Node, Angular2, Typescript, and any others that you may bring to the table. The ability to learn is more valuable than being a pro in all the tools from the get go, but familiarity with them is helpful. Any additional languages/tools, such as Python, C/C++, KDB+ are wholly welcome.Join a small team of talented developers, capable researchers, and finance people.It doesn't matter if you know our stack or not, if you love to learn you'll fit right in.

      Thanks for including the salary!
                      
                  
      Agreed.I am always interested in how the various positions rank vote-wise when the jobs post falls off the front page each month, and hope that this post's inclusion of salary info will be up-voted by those who wish to encourage others to include this information!
                      
                  
      I make it a point of always upvoting posts which include salary (even if the job itself doesn't seem great).
                      
                  
      Great idea, I will be doing the same from now on.
                      
                  
      I Think it is already reflecting...This was the only one with salary when I posted. Now several others joined too.
                      
                  
      I'll be upvoting the post for this reason.
                      
                  
      Me too. I think that's an excellent general guideline.
                      
                  
      Do applicants need security clearance? (i.e. could a Canadian citizen apply?)
                      
                  
      The position does require a security clearance, but we will take you through that process. As far as foreign nationals go, we have quite the international team here. Clearance requires a candidate to have lived in the US for the past three years, however.
                      
                  
      It probably doesn't require a security clearance, but all Federal jobs require the employee to be a US citizen.
                      
                  
      All in if this includes any software used to stop or make illegal any methods used in Flash Boys.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys
                      
                  
      Flash boys is almost required reading around here. While we stay away from saying HFT is good or bad we are working to make sure that HFT is done in a way that keep our markets safe and fair.
                      
                  
      Are the tools for internal use, external use, or both?
                      
                  
      For the moment, internal use.

Ladder is building a new type of insurance company that is all digital and sells directly to consumers.We are looking for talented full stack generalists that love building things and are excited to get in on the ground floor of disrupting a huge slow moving industry.This is a great opportunity for someone who is excited to:- build and architect systems- work with a small team of talented engineers- work with the latest tech- contribute to open source https://github.com/ladderlifeIf this sounds like you email me at jack@ladderlife.com
                      
                  
      Hi,Funny that your stack exactly matches what I'm doing currently on my own. I wonder - how do you build Clojure(Script) using Buck? Mind share a bit of details?Thanks
                      
                  
      Hey,I've been working on the CLJ(S) build system at Ladder. We use Buck to AOT compile clojure & clojurescript. The approach varies a little for the two.For clojure, we set up the proper classpath based on the deps & run clojure's compile primitive. This part isn't too hard. We use a genrule macro to get the classpath of a java_* rule ($(classpath //:foo)), and then we symlink the sources into $TMP/srcs in the right layout. For better performance we actually AOT the third party dependencies as separate rules. That way when we AOT our code, we only get .class files only for our code.For CLJS the story is a bit more complicated. The CLJS compiler doesn't natively support partial compilation. We ended up hacking the clojurescript compiler to dump the intermediate state as part of the build output. This isn't novel though - the compiler already dumps .cache.edn files with the same information. Once we have that, to compile dependent rules, we inject that state into the compiler before compilation.Other than the hack, CLJS compilation is like CLJ compilation. We compile third party deps as separate rules and use their namespace caches to compile dependent rules. The hard part is getting this to be fast - the cljs compiler isn't fast to boot. To help with start time, we developed a little clojure class that lets us inject a ClassLoader into a running clojure process. It properly manages both loading and unloading of clojure namespaces. We then use that as part of a worker_tool rule (https://buckbuild.com/rule/worker_tool.html) to keep a warm compiler for the entire build (in a similar spirit to Boot's "pods"). We're hoping to open-source what we're calling PersistentClj separately.As with all things novel, this is a bit experimental right now. We only recently started using buck for development. Moving production over is the next big step. There's still a long way to replacing figwheel usage, but we're going to try to do it. The biggest roadblock there is time - our priority is always on our product.We are definitely planning on opening this up once we've proven it out, so stay tuned. Or even better, come help us build it :)Mike

      Senior Backend Developer (Haskell) | AlphaSheets | up to $150k (depends on level of hire and equity tradeoff) + equity | Bay AreaWe're building the future of spreadsheets: collaborative, programmable in multiple languages, and highly extensible. We think spreadsheets haven't reached their full potential as a general computing platform. We envision a world where many more people are able to code thanks to the intuitive interface of a spreadsheet, where non-technical and technical analysts can share the same interface to data, and where everything from fully-featured data analysis and visualization apps to new spreadsheet functions can be shared, Google-Sheets style, on the AlphaSheets platform. We're an ambitious company with plenty of runway.Short video demo: http://d.pr/i/jK28.gifIf you're an opinionated functional programming proponent who hacks in Scala, Clojure, or Haskell in their free time, that's a great sign of a fit. Experience is a plus, but not a must as long as you're really smart. Doesn't matter if you don't know Haskell as long as you can learn. We have a React/Flow/Haskell stack. We love seeking leverage through good architecture, languages (Haskell!), frameworks, and tools.You'll be joining a team of 4 MIT dropouts (among them, one owned a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin mine in high school, two were USA Math Olympiad winners, and one made ~$300k on stat-arb trading in high school).Email me (Michael Gao, CEO) at michael (at) alphasheets (dot) com

      For non-NL residents you'll take home almost 65k after tax for 5 years. Rent in Amsterdam is ~900 EUR per month and you're close to a major station.Source: looking at a colleague's paysheet and getting angry that my first employer refused to fill in the paperwork for me (costing me 40% of that for 5 years).
                      
                  
      huh? 50k is not almost 65k (assuming you mean 30% ruling). Rent in Amsterdam is also more than 900Euro, unless you mean sharing a room, a shitty flat somewhere far from anything, or you know someone. I'd say 1300Eur is more reasonable price for someone new in the city.

      SiteDocs is hiring junior and senior programmers to join our REMOTE team, working on web and mobile applications for the construction industry. (SiteDocs headquarters are near Vancouver, but our dev team is spread throughout Canada and North America.)We're a growing B2B start-up with dozens of employees, thousands of users, and real revenue. Our mobile applications are built with Xamarin, and our web app is built with React, but we don't necessarily care if you've worked with either before as long as you're a good programmer who's interested in (and reasonably good at) learning new things.A job at SiteDocs means:* Being responsible for your own piece of the product. We're a relatively small team, and our product is relatively young, so the features and components you build will have a meaningful impact on our users' experiences.* The opportunity to teach (for senior developers) and to learn (for junior developers). Our company values continuous learning, and as a dev team we are more than happy to hire and train programmers right out of university (or self taught, etc).* Market salary. However, we're a Canadian company and our dollar is not doing very well these days, so it is currently difficult for us to pay in markets that demand more than $100k USD. I know that's a completely reasonable salary, but we're just not there at the moment and don't want to waste your time :) As a remote team, it is more feasible for us to hire people in low cost-of-living areas and paying them slightly above-market for their location.If you'd like to talk, please email dave.noel@sitedocs.com with "HN Hiring" in the subject line.

Hadoop cluster. And constantly keep getting better at it while measuring the impact on our
business.â€¢ Get stuff done. A problem partially solved today is better than a perfect solution next year. Have
an idea during the night ? Code it in the morning, push it at noon, test it in the afternoon and
deploy it the next morning.â€¢ High stakes, high rewards: 1% increase in performance may yield millions for the company. But if
a single bug goes through, the Internet goes down (weâ€™re only half joking).â€¢ Develop open source projects. Because we are working at the forefront of technology, we are
dealing with problems that few have faced. Weâ€™re big users of open source, and weâ€™d like to give
back to the community.Feel free to drop me a line for a chat =) n.rassam[at]criteo.com
