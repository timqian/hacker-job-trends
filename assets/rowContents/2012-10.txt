Khan Academy - Mountain View, CA - full-time and intern, designers and devsWe're a non-profit whose mission is to provide a world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We're scaling quickly.Our students answer over 2 million math problems per day (over 700mm total so far), all generated by our open source exercise generation framework (https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises), and our videos (now from a variety of authors including Sal) have been viewed over 190mm times. We're tracking all that data and using it to customize each student's experience as well as building brand-new tools like our new programming environment (http://ejohn.org/blog/introducing-khan-cs/). We could use your help.Working for Khan Academy is one of the highest educational impact positions you can imagine, and we've been called by Wired one of the best places to work in Silicon Valley: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4157078.We're hiring designers and all types of devs -- mobile, frontend, backend, whatever you want to call yourself. Big plans ahead.http://www.khanacademy.org/careers
                      
                  
      Do you have any opportunities for design internships?
                      
                  
      Yes! KA is looking for two types of design interns: product design interns, and visual design interns. We strongly recommend that product design interns be in (or have just completed) an HCI-like program[1] or have relevant real-world experience. Visual design interns can help with everything from making cool stuff around the office, to creating assets (like avatars) for the site, so digital art skills are a must.The design team is much smaller than the dev team so we will likely only be taking one or two interns this year.[1] http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/
                      
                  
      I'm currently enrolled in a masters HCI-like program, do you have a way I can get in touch with you? My email is in my profile if you would like to reply that way.
                      
                  
      For internships, is this paid or unpaid?
                      
                  
      Paid. Even though we're a nonprofit, our salaries are competitive with other tech companies.

      New York, NY. Full time. We're looking for devops, python engineers and frontend (js/backbone) engineers.Percolate is a very quickly growing SAAS company in NYC. We are building a tool that helps brands create content across social. What makes us unique is that we're the only platform that doesn't already assume a brand knows what to say. To help them figure that out we pull data from across the web and make recommendations on interesting content (whether their own or third-party) that might be interesting at any moment.We're looking for backend (all levels) and frontend engineers (we run backbone.js alongside our RESTful API) to join the team (the company is 21, product team is currently at 12). On the backend, we're especially interested in folks with good experience working with lots of data and excited to build real-time systems (we run python).Here's a few reasons why you should come work here: - You are gonna work in SOHO on Broadway - Your chance to work with big data - You come in early: We're only-and-a-half a year old - As we get bigger, you will be able to focus on what you are good at - We are all different and we love it - GPL compliant company - You choose your workstation - You choose your tools - No worries, free your mind: NY salary + medical + dental - No vacation policy - does not mean no vacation ;) - Company invests in you: Fly to PyCon and other conferences - We prefer quality over quantity: Focus on clean code and test coverage - Your voice will be heardIf you're interested email us at jobs@percolate.com.

Thanks.
                      
                  
      >No vacation policyThis seems like you'd want to explain it a little more, given plenty of other companies cover flights to conferences and while that's a nice perk nobody considers it to be a vacation.
                      
                  
      I'd assume it means that they don't give you a set number of vacation days, but instead trust you to take vacations when you want, for how long you want, as long as you're not taking unfair advantage of their policy.

      I started with this team about a month ago and have been very impressed. I was quite concerned going from a two-person startup (that was, unfortunately, going nowhere) to a company with 110,000 employees, but this team is great. And the Cambridge office has an amazing view!

      Do you have a preference for either Yesod or Snap?
                      
                  
      We use Snap, but frankly if you know one, you can learn the other in a matter of hours. One of the nice things about Haskell is that the API often speaks for itself, and for all their differences, their APIs are actually fairly similar.Also, it may be of note that I am one of the core contributors to the Snap Framework.

      Tesla Motors | Stationary Storage group | Full time | Palo Alto, CAThe Stationary Storage team at Tesla Motors is growing and weâ€™re looking for smart and versatile developers to add to the team. Our current team is very small and weâ€™re looking for a hand-on, generalist who will get things done. You will work on a variety of subsystems, some are existing codebases (with other users and developers) that need modification for our application, while other projects are new and specific to our group. The team is small and you will be able to shape the direction of the product and a large amount of ownership of the firmware and software that is specific to this application ranging from architecture to implementation to testing.Here are some of the projects that we see coming up soon:* Embedded C on a microcontroller with an RTOS* Communication over CAN, Ethernet, zigbee, and GSM networks* Machine learning for analyzing and modeling energy systems (Weâ€™ve been using Matlab and Go, but would love to explore R, Hadoop, and AWS)* Design and evaluation of algorithms for energy and power markets (think Quant algos but controlling real hardware and moving energy instead of money).* Designing a robust system to control distributed resources* UI for customer facing control and data viewing* Development of parsers/compilers/code-transformers/DSLs for templating and code generation.While this isnâ€™t the typical HN job, we could see many of these projects appealing to people who are excited about at least several of:* Green Energy* Physical hardware* Parsers/Compilers/DSLs* Machine learning/algos for people who donâ€™t want to work in Finance* A variety of languages and technology (in the last 6 months I have used C, Python, Perl, Go, Matlab/Octave, Tcl, VB, and in my small circle people are using Ruby, Java, php, R and probably others.)
We are a small team working on energy and designing physical hardware (which you will control!), so our internal conversions are more likely to touch on â€œwatt-hoursâ€� and â€œtooling costsâ€� than â€œclosuresâ€� and â€œappsâ€�.
We would love to see (but we have some positions that don't require these):* Comfortable with embedded C* Degree in Engineering or experience with EnergyIf you are interested in this job please email tcasebolt@teslamotors.comThere are also many more positions available in other groups at Tesla Motors, which you can see here: http://www.teslamotors.com/about/careers
                      
                  
      Oh God... I always said that the only companies I'd give up my startup ambitions for was SpaceX and Tesla. I just returned to Toronto from San Jose and I saw your plant from the 880. Absolutely amazing looking.Can you tell us more about what the stationary storage team works on? From the name, it sounds to be the systems that the user uses when they store the vehicle at the end of their trip?
                      
                  
      If this makes the news I'll probably be fired :-)Stationary Storage is basically energy storage (in non-moving context) and is commonly tied to the electrical grid.  There are various technologies used for stationary storage like compressed air, flywheels, pumped hydro, and batteries.  I'll let you guess which one we work with.I can't talk specifically about any of our projects, but a few of them have had an article or two if you dig around.  Sorry for the secrecy, but it's very exciting and there's a lot going on.  If you're still interested in working on our team, I can tell you more project and technical details when you get in touch.

      LocBox, San Francisco, Frontend Engineer, Rails Developer, Data Scientist, RelocationDear (Future) LocBox Engineer,Itâ€™s only October 1st and this thread has become so noisy that youâ€™ve either a) resorted to keyword searches OR b) gone back to the 10 blank check offers youâ€™ve received in the last 6 minutes OR c) rightfully concluded that YOU are the worldâ€™s most interesting man/woman.With that in mind (and after this author has cried quiet tears about the cooler job market when they graduated MSCS â€˜05), letâ€™s get the relevant keywords out of the way: Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Information Retrieval, CoffeeScript, Backbone, San Francisco, product/market fit, Local, Offline-to-Online, Predictable Revenue, Not-A-Game.Now that generic recruiter-style keywords are published, let me attempt to stand out from the crowd - Iâ€™m CEO at LocBox (http://www.getlocbox.com) and weâ€™re rethinking the way local businesses generate revenue and foot traffic from their customers.Most local businesses resort to unsustainable daily deals or boring Email Marketing to acquire and retain customers. We reject that status quo and our hundreds of (paying) customers agree. Weâ€™ve also developed a new search/crawl/tech-centric way of acquiring our own customers and disagree with the wildly obsolete feet-on-street Sales model. The company is small but generating material and predictable revenue.Weâ€™re venture-funded (2.5+ years cash in the bank), are working on interesting technology problems and pride ourselves on working hard, drinking bacon-flavored vodka and keeping bureaucrats out. And if you care about it, yes, we have a super-nice office with Bay Bridge views and non-mandatory Halo parties.Talk to Us? http://www.getlocbox.com/careers, saumil at getlocbox dot com, http://blog.getlocbox.com

      Zapier (YC) - Mountain View, CA - full-time, remote possible - developers & designersWe want to bring the power of APIs to the masses and make all web apps talk to each other.We're primarily Python & Coffeescript touching a bit of everything from Redis and ElasticSearch to Node.js and RabbitMQ. As far as we're concerned the stack is always in flux, we subscribe to no dogmas.A full stack engineer would fit right in, and prior experience isn't a big deal: good hackers love learning new stuff (as do we, so we hope you can teach us awesome new things).A designer with a UX background would also have major impact. Trying to represent the insane complexity around mapping disparate APIs is hard, but even more challenging is giving non-technical users the tools to do it.We'd love to talk about the problems we're having, you can visit http://zapier.com/ and chat us up.

      FoundationDB - Vienna, VA (DC Suburb) - Evangelist remote, core engineer must be local but we would consider relocation expenses.FoundationDB (http://foundationdb.com) is fundamentally new database technology, built completely from the OS up. It is a NoSQL database (distributed, ordered key-value design) with high levels of fault tolerance and performance, but with the most important missing feature given up by other NoSQL databases - true ACID transactions. Our primary value proposition is that we give you the best of both worlds - the distributed design / scalability, fault tolerance, and flexible data models of NoSQL, and the strong data consistency guarantees of single machine relational databases.We are well funded, and are currently in the latter stages of our alpha program and have a very long and impressive list of alpha users that includes "household" tech names. Public beta is expected soon.Who we're looking for:A software engineer to add to our core development team. The most important traits this person should have are a strong background in computer science, experience working with distributed systems, and a desire to work on and solve difficult problems in an interactive team setting. Some pluses would include C++ and Java experience. Must be a friendly person who enjoys working with other people as we are a very team-centric environment.A Developer Evanglist - this person should have experience building interesting applications using popular technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Django, etc. and be able to show us a few cool projects they've worked on. They should also be able to interact well with new people (they will be attending conferences on our behalf, visiting offices of other startups, etc.) and be well spoken, both in small groups and on stage giving presentations. Must also be willing and able to interact heavily with the developer community on popular social networking sites. The ability to write some thoughtful blog posts would be great as well. Ideally this person would be located in (or willing to move to) NYC or the Bay Area, so that we can have a more ongoing presence in those places.Apply at info@foundationdb.com

      Transcriptic: Core Developer or Automation EngineerMenlo Park, CATranscriptic is the "Amazon Web Services" for life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development.  Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.We're a very small startup (you'd be #5), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.max at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/

Competitive pay / significant equity.We are building a multi-platform security application and API that solves a relatively common problem for businesses and end-users in the domain of cloud storage and cloud-based sharing. You will be working directly with the founders and must be prepared to take ownership of significant portions of the product. Of course, you will be given the freedom to make decisions on your own.Our product is multi-platform (currently Windows and Mac + some linux support), and our API can be used both at the client and server. The core application code is in portable C++, and we have front-ends in Cocoa and .Net, with Qt frontends in the works. There is a lot of crypto and experience working with cryptographic libraries is a huge plus.Requirements:* Plenty of C++ programming experience, especially systems code. Any platform is okay (Windows / Mac / Linux), as long as you are not biased against working on another platforms if required. 
* Great object oriented design and API design skills.Other good-to-have skills:   * Ruby on Rails 
   * In-browser cryptography (JS crypto, Native Client experience a plus)
   * UI programming -- Qt / Cocoa / .Net
   * iOS / Android experience
   * Desktop application design / testing experience

We've still got the startup environment (kegs, dog, etc); we're located in downtown San Francisco, half a block from MoMa; we are in a unique position to do great stuff and solve hard problems while helping people find great local businesses.I built our "Hot New Businesses" feature - http://yelp.com/openings/sf , for instance, you can find it on the homepage and in our mobile apps too - which crunches through our data nightly and generates a list of the most recently opened bars and restaurants in your city, complete with predictions of the day they opened on. It's a really useful feature, and we have so much data that I was able to build it without knowing anything about machine learning, data-mining, etc; imagine the crazy-useful stuff you could do here, if a knucklehead like me could make a feature like this.For more info about what it's like to work here as an engineer, see a Q&A with me at http://officialblog.yelp.com/2011/07/day-in-the-life-of-a-ye.... , or feel free to contact me at jrheard at yelp dot com.Here's a list of our open engineering positions:Web Developerâ˜† Develop cool and useful features for our 61M+ monthly visitorsâ˜† Expertise in JavaScript, HTTP, HTML/DOM, and CSS, as well as server-side chops in a language like Python, Ruby, Java, C++, etc. We're on Python, but we're just looking for people who are really good at programming, so no worries if you don't have much Python experience.Search and Data-Mining Engineerâ˜† Tackle machine learning and information retrieval problems from our database of 22M+ Yelp reviewsâ˜† Strong grasp of algorithms and data structures; expertise in Python, Java, or C++

  | Redwood City, CA - UI Engineer |
  +--------------------------------+

Tidemark Systems (http://www.tidemark.net, note ".net") is hiring.Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem.  For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of.  But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do.  So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great.  But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.  You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience.  If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code.  This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job.  This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.  The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.We've got a bunch of other openings (see http://tidemark.net/company/careers)    * Technical Support Engineer
    * Director of People Operations
    * Operations Engineer
    * Graphic Designer - Web Developer Emphasis
    * Sr. Technical Writer
    * Enterprise Account Executive
    * Application Tier Developer
    * Computation Engine Developer

      Amsterdam, The Netherlands. H1B[1]Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a developer there currently working on infrastructure tasks and relocated over there about two years ago, and have been very happy with it.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and a few CPAN modules.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it. You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a couple of times before and have already helped get one person hired, many others have had or are having interviews, and I've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent.

Our implementation and customization projects are usually one week to two months long, so youâ€™ll enjoy a wide range of work on interesting problems for clients in many regions and industries. Recent projects have included a touchscreen system for warehouse tracking, integration with accounting systems, complex custom finance and billing reports, and automatic data synchronization.Both teams have an enjoyable and collaborative culture in a creative environment. We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base.

      San Jose, Santa Cruz :: Build FPGA design tools at AlteraAltera is one of the leading designers of FPGA devices in the world. I'm an engineer in the software team, developing mostly embedded design and instrumentation tools for FPGAs. We are looking for software developers experienced or with a strong desire to learn about Computer Architecture, FPGA design, Digital Logic, Embedded Systems, and more, while at the same time developing engineering design tools in high level languages.To give you an idea of what we do, these are some of the projects that involved me at Altera:  * Designed and implemented a high performance on-chip network that's used
    in thousands of routers, base stations, and switches around the world.
  * Created a hardware/software instrumentation framework in a mix of Java, C++, C, 
    and Verilog. This is the foundation for all the debuggers at Altera.
  * Modified the GCC toolchain to add support for Altera's processors, like our
    NiosII soft processor.
  * Implemented a GDB Server from scratch in Java.
  * Defined and implemented the pieces of an ARM CoreSight debug subsystem.
  * Implemented infrastructure used in a C-to-Gates compiler.
  * Spent hours hacking away with the tools and many of the available
    development boards.

      Vena Solutions - Toronto, Canada (Full-time)We're a well funded company in full entrepreneurial growth mode looking to hire the best.  We have two postings up on Careers 2.0 for Java and C# engineers:C# Software Engineer: http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/24625/software-enginee...Java Software Engineer: http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/24488/software-enginee...Here is our story :)In the Enterprise world Excel is everything. They love it, use it every day and whisper sweet nothings to it at night. The problem is that over time when dealing with a large number of users and lots of Excel files, Excel becomes unmanageable, inefficient and eventually 'Excel Hell' takes over.What invariably ends up happening is a big old-guard player comes in and convinces the company to get rid of Excel, getting them to use an Excel 'look and feel'. The problem is that it's not Excel - rather it's a crappy web grid that gives the company 10% of what Excel can do. This story has played out over and over again â€“ the customer buys the solution, ends up hating it and eventually moves back to using Excel.At Vena we're coming at it from an entirely different angle: stay in Excel! We provide all the benefits of a big player solution while keeping the user in the one place they know and love: Excel.We're a well funded company in full entrepreneurial growth mode looking to hire the best. If you want to work on something that great companies like McDonalds and Wells Fargo actually use then look no further than Vena Solutions.

      San FranciscoFreedom FreightRails Engineers, iOS EngineerThe last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Freedom Freight is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry. We are changing that.If you're ready to change the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to sean@freedomfreightusa.com

      This is where I currently work and It has been an amazing experience.  I have grown so much as a developer here because of the culture.  Kgray really gives you the freedom to explore new technologies and encourages it.  On Fridays you'll often find us debating up and coming trends in programming.Our team is structured as follows: The owners give Kgray complete control over development, this is why we are allowed to have a hacker friendly culture.  The team consists of 5 developers with a variety of backgrounds: some self  taught, some with formal training.  This is because what matters here is passion, skill, and talent.So what is cool about the product?  Notice in Kgray's post it says "Remote OK".  This is because our product is about facility management.  The way people of all backgrounds interact with their employers is changing, and is changing in a big way.  That is what all of our current development is about.  So if you want to be apart of this change, this change that accounts for 40+ hours a week for every working man/woman in the world, give Kgray a shout.  I guarantee you will look at your time at iOffice fondly.
                      
                  
      Hoping you'll see this even though it's two weeks later but would iOffice be interested in recent grads?

      Afar Media | Full Time | San FranciscoAfar Media is a collaborative travel guide as well as a printed travel magazine.
I'm the lead engineer for a three-person team, and we're looking to add a front-end developer. We use Rails 3, Slim and all the attendant technologies (jQuery, CoffeeScript, drinking lots of coffee). Lately, we've been using Ember.js, which is awesome.I'll paste below our official post, but let me say up front why I think this is a great job.- We work reasonable hours and we're paid well for our time. (No nebulous promises of worthless equity for infinite hours at the desk.)- We believe in travel so strongly that we pay you to do it. That is, each employee gets a yearly travel stipend and three weeks vacation to use it. The only caveat is it must be international travel and it must be to a city you've never visited before. (Note: this is an awesome caveat.)- Live somewhere else in the US? Maybe we could work something out about working remotely transition into working in the office. (Maybe. Tell us what's up. I started working remotely from Chicago before moving to SF.)---- Begin Official Description ----AFAR Media is a well-funded travel media start-up spanning print and web. We have big monitors, stand-up desks, and fancy new laptops. Your coworkers will be be developers, designers, project mangers, and (this is the cool part) magazine editors, meaning you'll work with a wider ranger of personalities than the standard developer scrum.This job is ideal for someone who loves to travel for fun (the position does not require travel, but a fulfilling life does, and one of our great perks is a yearly travel stipend).

      Here's the Product Manager listing. Please contact our office manager, Erin Alex if you're interested. She can be reached via: erin(dot)alex(at)maxifier(dot)comPosition: Product Manager (all levels)
Location: New York CityJob Responsibilities
+ Own it: Ownership and accountability for new revenue-generating features.
+ Soup to nuts: Responsibility over all product lifecycle, from vision to handoff.
+ Collaborate: Interactively work with Senior Management, Sales, Marketing, Professional Services, Account Management, and R&D to define product vision based on customer feedback and functional needs and requirements.
+ Drive it: Define and drive go-to-market strategy, planning, and execution for new product offerings and releases.
+ Be an all-star: You look at the stack of responsibilities that a PM owns and you say "yes, of course." Competitive analysis, backlogs, drafting marketing collateral, internal training on your new features, go-to-market, feedback loops, customer betas, agile user stories, helping with product marketing, working with the UX team, and all the usual mini-specs, daily standups, iteration planning, and customer validation. Plus you can tell us more responsibilities that we forgot in this list.Qualifications
+ Donâ€™t hate ads: 5+ years of Online Media or AdTech Product Management experience. Prior work experience at an ad server, network, or ad technology platform preferred.
+ Be edumacated: At least have a B.A./B.S. or equivalent degree. Kudos if you have a technical degree (Computer Science / Engineering) or an MBA from a top school, but itâ€™s not required.
+ You've got to be able to talk to the geeks: You'll work with an engineering counterpart to define product release requirements, and work with marketing communications to define the go-to-market strategy, helping them understand the product positioning, key benefits, and target customer. That means you need to speak two languages in addition to your own.
+ Terabytes of data donâ€™t intimidate you: You wonâ€™t be manipulating the data yourself, but the product you are building will. Wait, did we say terabytes? We meant petabytes.
+ Donâ€™t work solo in your fiefdom: Excellent communications skills. It's hard to preach if no one can understand what you're saying or writing, right?
+ Control your product roadmap: Scope, needs, requirements and uh, yeah, resources. You know how to manage these. That's the forced choice/technical project management part of the role. Sounds fun, right? Help us figure out which two of three things we want: good, fast, or cheap (and we always want good). 
+ Manifesto: You get agile. Good agile vs bad agile, you know the difference. You know why this bullet starts with the word "manifesto."
+ Cha-ching: Proven ability to balance the need of the customer while maintaining corporate objectives. Be laser-focused on helping all of us make money.
+ Attitude and team fit matters: Organized with a rigorous attention to detail, drive for excellence, and a positive "can-do" approach. You turn buzzwords into reality.

It's not time yet for us to publicize details of our technology, but do look carefully at what our team members have done in the past.For the software engineering positions, we aren't looking for any specific domain expertise because what we're doing involves significant depth and breadth of computer science. The ability to context switch between a diverse range of things is the primary thing we care about. It's highly likely that a great programmer with experience on any platform and in any compiled programming language will find our work interesting, challenging, and rewarding. Examples of "any" would be one or more of C, C++, and Objective-C on one or more of Android, iOS, Linux, OS X, and Windows.
