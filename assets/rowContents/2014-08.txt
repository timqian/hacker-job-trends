      You say there are internship possibilities, but on the jobs page you link to, it says there are none available. Is this the case? Or can these be arranged informally?
                      
                  
      Short answer, yes! We bring on a lot of interns every summer, and some on different schedules too. Fall is when we do the most interviews for internships, looking for the next summer's batch.

      What's wrong with Antarctica?(And we have a quite good broadband connection here...)
                      
                  
      This is a bit off-topic but how realistic is it to move to and live in Antartica these days? I'm asking out of natural curiosity.
                      
                  
      Actually, my comment was intended as a [half-] joke. In fact, I was once researching about relatively long-term job options in Antarctica - and I remember there were some options for IT staff.As for the short-term travel, it is quite expensive:http://www.antarcticconnection.com/shopcontent.asp?type=trav...
                      
                  
      It doesn't sound like they are excluding people from Antarctica (since it is REMOTE), just that they don't have an office on that continent (yet ;).

      HubSpot - Cambridge/Boston, MA - http://www.hubspot.comHubSpot is a great place to work.  In fact, it was ranked the #2  place to work in Massachusetts and we're the fastest growing non-public software company in the US (and 33rd fastest growing non-public company).  We focus on helping businesses with their online marketing - specifically helping them to avoid interrupting and annoying their customers with bad marketing.In Engineering, we're organized into small teams where you get to have a big impact on the product.  We have a great environment to move quickly in and deploy hundreds of times a day.  We use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, an internal deployer system for zero-downtime deploys, and we even have a Heroku-style system coming (for those that would ask "why not just use Docker?", there's still the provisioning and routing issue).On the backend, we use Java and Python (though more Java these days).  It's really modern Java.  We use Dropwizard which is really wonderful if you haven't checked it out (annotate paths similarly to how you'd use Flash in Python and just have the method return an object and Jackson will serialize it into JSON and return it - Java can be really nice).  For data, HBase, Hadoop, MySQL, ZoopKeeper, Redis, and Memcached all have their place.  Again, we deploy hundreds of times a day so don't expect your code to languish in the repository.  We like pushing small changes fast.On the front end, we use Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, and jQuery.  We also have our iPhone and Android applications.Engineers get a lot of responsibility from the start and you'll usually push changes your first day.  You'll also get a Retina MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt display.Work schedules are flexible.  Most engineers keep a 10-6 schedule.  You get to make a meaningful difference in a product with loads of paying customers and a ton of traffic.  Best of all, you get to work with loads of smart and fun people.  That's the best thing about HubSpot: the people are great people that you can rely on, learn from, and have a great time getting things done with.Software Engineering: http://jobvite.com/m?3N1tAgwCAll Jobs: http://jobvite.com/m?3S1tAgwH

          CloudFlare is hiring Go, Lua, PHP JavaScript developers
    London and San Francisco
    ---
Positions are here: https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-teamBut, actually, ignore the specific positions. If you like working in Go, or Lua, or PHP, or JavaScript and want to come work for a company that's growing rapidly and has a ton of code to write in all those languages just apply. We've hired lots of people who aren't a specific fit for a job that's listed on that board.
                      
                  
      Would be nice if you could send at least generic "No Thanks" for applicants.
                      
                  
      Did you apply to CloudFlare and not receive a response? If so, I need to follow up internally.
                      
                  
      Yes, a month ago.

      PACKETZOOM ENGINEERINGBurlingame, CA (just south of San Francisco in the bay area) FULL TIME H1B
VISA Transfer ok for the right candidate. TN VISA ok.  REMOTE considered for
the perfect candidateMobile Networks are different. And yet we continue using the same legacy
protocol stack (TCP/HTTP/SSL) to connect mobile devices to the cloud. If you
want to help change that, come join us.Packetzoom is rethinking the whole stack from the ground up. You get to hack
network and/or security protocols, innards of mobile operating systems and
build a global distributed system around brand new protocols. It's a very
small (but well funded) team so everyone contributes in everything. But
following two are the roles where we have specific needs to fill right now.1) SENIOR ENGINEERING LEADERIF you have shipped products or built services where you (at least) actually
had to deal with unix at the syscall level (either in the userspace or kernel)
in C/C++ code, I want to talk to you. If you've shipped and maintained the
product for a few years, I really want to talk to you. You'd be responsible
for leading the team the team that builds and runs the packetzoom protocol on
mobile clients (iOS, Android and any others we decide to pursue) as well as
our globally distributed cluster of servers. No pressure ;-)2) UNIX HACKER WITH AN ANDROID BENTIF you're the kind of person who isn't happy until you've fixed up your
android phone so you can ssh into it to, say, kill offending processes and/or
run cron jobs,  I want to talk to you. You'd be responsible for our Android
platform (so you'd be writing some combination of Java and C++ code). In the
process, you'd get to learn all about vagaries of mobile platforms and mobile
networks at the global scale. In addition, you'll have your pick of dozens of
delicious, hard problems to solve in the realm of distributed systems, unix'y
things, iOS stuff, security stuff etc. if you're so inclined.I'm a Founder/CEO/CTO. You will work directly with me. We're well funded but
still a very small team (< 10 people) So you get to enjoy an early stage team
environment but not so much the high financial risk that goes with such
things
                      
                  
      this seems to be a great project. But the demo on your site which is in horizontal mode is so hard to see ... I have problem with my neck after watching it ... 
But great job !
                      
                  
      Shift â€“ Software Engineer â€“ San Francisco, Castro district â€“ full time â€“ VISA welcomeShift is building a new way to buy and sell cars. The founding team includes the co-founder of Taxi Magic; an experienced Google and Dropbox engineer; the founder of Google Fiber; and the former lead designer at Dropbox.We are looking for engineers who have strong product sense and are passionate about technology and user experience. This includes full-stack, frontend, backend, and mobile engineers. Join our team, come in at the ground level, and shape a product with great potential to transform an enormous market!Our tech stack is HTML5, iOS, Android, and Go.Cars are the largest retail vertical in the US â€“ consumers buy almost 50 million new and used cars every year, totaling $1 trillion in value. Yet technology has barely touched the market; Americans buy cars in the same, burdensome ways they did decades ago. Selling a car means either letting the dealer collect a huge margin in a trade-in, or significant hassle selling to a private party.

      New York City, NYC, NY @ Justworks http://www.justworks.comJustworks is the best way to setup your companies payroll and benefits.  We are a small but experienced team (only 4 devs counting the CEO) of startup veterans (Amazon, Etsy, Daily Candy) with previous exits.  We are growing extremely quickly.We are hiring across the stack, looking for people with solid CS fundamentals who are comfortable working on any part of the stack but specialize in one (front end, backend, devops etc.).

We are a rails shop, but don't require that you know rails or even ruby before coming here (I didn't and I turned out just fine).We're especially looking for senior level people who are opinionated about their technology and the way their team works.  We want people who want to contribute to the engineering culture of the team and are excited to help build a world class engineering team.

      NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH.We have a position listed on usajobs.gov[1] (which is not the easiest site to search) for software development here. The listing says "internship" for the hiring program, but this is really a full-time permanent position in the agency.Hard requirements are 1) U.S. Citizenship, and 2) that you be within 2 years of graduation (pre or post) from a degree-seeking program (undergraduate or graduate).There is no specific language for this position (though Python + scipy + numpy is probably a big plus), the preference instead is on strong general CS fundamentals and interest in solving interesting problems. Broadly speaking, the responsibilities will be to provide assistance to a variety of different research and engineering projects through software development, as need arises.This may sound a bit vague, but I'd be happy to describe some examples in more detail if anyone would like.I am not technically on the hiring committee, but have agreed to help staff the position. PM me if you have any questions!https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/376181600
                      
                  
      "within 2 years of graduation (pre OR POST)".  IOW, disqualified if you graduated more than two years ago?
                      
                  
      Unfortunately under this hiring program, yes. But if a listing with wider scope is posted, I will update this or include it in next month's listings on HN.

      Close - San FranciscoHiring full-time in SF (SoMA), contract-to-hire preferred:  * Generalist Software Engineer 
  * Data Engineer
  * Data Scientist
  * UX/UI/Rapid Prototyper

We're a seed funded startup - 3 former Googlers - and we're tackling the messy world of business. Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're changing that.It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here's my take on the space: https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don't mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we're in. We've had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it.You'd be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together.For our generalist role we'd prefer it if you have Rails experience; for our data roles, Python. Graph-specific data experience is a bonus.I lead engineering at Close, and I'm also happy to chat for coffee if you're interested in startups, this problem space, or if you're interested in the product itself.Email jennie+HN@close.co.

      Arista Networks - Software and Hardware Engineers[Santa Clara, with satellite offices in San Francisco, Vancouver, Bangalore]Tags: Networking, Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, SDNWe're shaking up the world of datacenter networking (think switches and routers), led by an incredibly smart and pragmatic engineering team. If you're on the software side, work on a modern software stack (amusingly, that's a rarity in the networking world), and hack on incredibly distributed systems approaching ridiculous scaling requirements, mostly in C++/Python. The hardware side builds some of the meanest and most efficient boxes out thereâ€”the things that they churn out of their workshop never ceases to amaze me.In any case, we're constantly shipping code, genuinely working to improve the state-of-the-art, changing the entire networking industry, and making money while doing it (See: $ANET). It's a pretty fun time - come check us out at http://www.arista.com/en/careers/engineeringFeel free to ask me any questions, too (contact info in my profile).

We're a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company thatâ€™s making moves.  Sound interesting?  Let us know what makes you the perfect candidate.Why weâ€™re special:
