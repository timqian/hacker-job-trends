      Hi there - is remote OK?
                      
                  
      "This is a full-time position based in EFF's office in San Francisco, CA. Inquiries about whether this job can be done remotely or part-time will not be answered. No phone calls please!"
                      
                  
      Is there a number I can call?
                      
                  
      The general EFF phone number is (415) 436-9333.But if you need legal help you can email info@eff.org.And if you'd like to work on EFF's tech operations team, email techjobs@eff.org.
                      
                  
      Very disappointing.
                      
                  
      Dear employers, please stop mentioning  'remote' unless a) you're OK with r-emote employees, or b) your business is all about about disrupting "r-emote controls", innovating "r-emote assistance" or something like that.If your posting doesn't include it we'll assume it's not allowed, and you're well within your rights to toss out any application that does request it. Look at it as the easiest filter you'll ever find for resumes. If you really feel need to stress that the job isn't for r-emote workers just say 'LOCAL ONLY' or something like that. Pretty please?@_whoishiring could you add something to that effect to the monthly post?
                      
                  
      LOCAL ONLY with caps on should be fine. Because, from my experience, if the company doesn't mention rem0te, it doesn't really mean that they are not open to rem0te candidates, especially if you're a good fit.
                      
                  
      I'm assuming your trying to search and only see remote positions. Quick CLI hack, tested only on MacOSX w/ gnu coreutils:<select all from this page, copy>
pbpaste | tr '\n' 'â�„' | sed 's/\[âˆ’\]/\n/g' | grep -ai 'remote' | grep -avi 'no remote' | tr 'â�„' '\n'
                      
                  
      I know I could do it with a pretty straightforward script, but it's not as simple as a ctrl+f, and it requires me being on a machine w/ unix tools (i.e. not a PC or mobile device).
                      
                  
      Yeah, this is really annoying. Ctrl-f r emote and I just get millions of "no re mote" posts. I think most people assume it's not remo te unless stated explicitly, so there's no need to say 'no rem ote'.
                      
                  
      Scalyr - Frontend, Backend, Devops Engineers - San Francisco Peninsula - $110k-$150k+, >1% equityHi, Iâ€™m Steve Newman. You might remember me from such HN posts as "Searching 20 GB/sec" and "EC2 I/O".We're rebuilding server and log monitoring from the ground up, bringing Google Search levels of power and responsiveness to operations visibility. We have a small, tight team (lots of room for personal growth), traction, plenty of runway, a low-stress culture, and lots of meaty problems to tackle. Be part of an awesome founding team (including the cofounder / lead engineer from Writely -- now Google Docs). Weâ€™re aiming high, rethinking everything from how logs are stored to how engineers interact with their tools. Come help us figure it out!https://www.scalyr.com/jobs, or I'd love to hear from you personally (contact info in my profile).[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7715025[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4666855
                      
                  
      Liars! Frontend, backend, junior, senior -- if you have talent and passion, we have a place for you. doesn't square with a refusal because "your resume focuses on system administration, operations, and other activities that don't involve engineering / coding." If you're looking for talent and passion, then hire for talent and passion.
                      
                  
      I'm part of a small team of expats from Silicon Valley that came out to DC last year to help fix healthcare.gov. (Mostly Stanford, Google, YCombinator folks) We've learned a ton, and see an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people - we've started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.In the last 6 months, we've launched 2 major projects:- App 2.0, the new insurance application for healthcare.gov. It's processing 70% of apps coming through the marketplace, and: converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, is mobile-friendly (20% of apps), sits on robust, scalable infrastructure, etc etc. It was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service) ever hosted on Amazon AWS.- Scalable Login System (SLS), the new identity management system for healthcare.gov. Sadly, the main achievement here is that the system is actually up and available, unlike its predecessor. It's now saving the taxpayer $70M in annual maintenance costs.Here's a Wired article from last summer about us:
http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/Our momentum is strong, the problem is important, and we're looking for good people.If you're the type that would get fired up about reimagining broken government experiences and technology, please drop us a line at jobs@navahq.com, we'd love to hear from you!
                      
                  
      Let me get this straight.  We spent hundreds of millions of dollars buiding a bad website.  You then get hired to fix it.  Again paid by taxpayer dollars.  Now you are running a private company that will benefit greatly from this work.  And, presumably, the company has investors who will now ride a sweet ride to massive profits because of all of the above.I hope I am wrong.  I hope 100% of your work was funded privately.  Otherwise you and your investors are nothing but a bunch of thieves.  In other words, a perfect fit for government irrespective of party affilliation.If I am wrong I apologize profusely.  Someone does have to ask these questions.  There is absolutely no accountability in government.  They lie to us and burn our cash lavishly.  Try to tell the IRS that you deleted all your financial records and emails or lie to Congress or any Federal agency and see how quickly you end up in jail.Just sick of it.
                      
                  
      Reboot -- you make no sense. Private contractors are hired all the time by the Government. They did work, delivered something of quality, and got paid for it. It's not thievery at all.
                      
                  
      Let's say you own a company.  You hire a group of programmers to come in and fix or develop some code.  You pay them a lot of money for this work.  When they are done they use the code YOU PAID FOR to form a company, attract investors and go into business.That is theft.Is this company using code and tools developed with taxpayer money to now profit?  Are investors going to profit from something that we paid for and should rightfully be in the public domain.What I said makes complete sense provided the scenario I painted is correct.What would it look like to not be considered theft?  Something like this: The government needs help fixing the Obamacare website.  A group of investors gets together to fund the required work.  They compete for the contract with others.  One wins the contract.  They offer their services at a reasonable cost.  The government stipulates that all software developed under this contract will be open source and in the public domain.  The company completes the work.  Now it can apply for a contract to maintain and enhance the codebase.  And so can anyone else.  We, the taxpayers, paid for the code and own it.  We did not pay to fund a for profit company that would then hild us hostage, have a monopoly based on what should be a public open source code base and create millions of dollars of profit for investors who did not fund the development of that code and took none of the risk.For all I know these folks are on the level.  If that's the case I apologize with all sincerity.  Still, I would like to see a statement clarifying whether or not a substantial portion of their now-commercial code base was paid for with taxpayer dollars under "war emergency" conditions and if they are effectively stealing what should be owned by the people of the US in order to form the foundation of a company that is probably going to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars per year with a virtual monopoly.  I'd like to see that question answered.
                      
                  
      It's not theft. In fact, many companies are started this way. As long as they negotiate a contract that retains or licenses code use, they're good.Businesses do this to each other all the time. Why should Government be special? I don't believe the software would have been written in the first place if your idealistic regulations were in existence, and the people who'd be at a loss would be.... the taxpayers! If the service that way paid for was delivered and the contract made the proper stipulations, this is all fine and dandy.Also, "we the taxpayers own it" if it's open-source is also not true. If the BSD license was put to use, for example, then any company could go off and make money using the source code.
                      
                  
      The story of healthcare.gov is that one set of federal contractors totally messed it up, and that another group of folks managed to get it back on track. It's not reasonable to claim that the latter group is somehow profiting unethically from the failure of the former.
                      
                  
      Hey, I'm interested in learning more about your work and the team. Just curious if this is your website - http://navahq.com/
                      
                  
      Very interesting!  Their website has a funny placeholder YouTube video and nothing more.  Can anyone confirm that this is indeed a legitimate jobs email address?  Couldn't find anything about them on LinkedIn or anywhere else and the article doesn't mention this company, so it'd be nice to verify since it sounds like a pretty interesting team to join.

Still early enough to make a difference, but we're now big enough that the difference you make will affect a large number of customers on day one, including Hacker News, Reddit, Stack Exchange, basically every bitcoin or torrent site ever, and 2M more.We're engineering driven, and have been great at solving hard engineering challenges (we've got nginx core team, some deep kernel tap knowledge, and insane levels of performance optimization up and down the stack), but we're hiring across the company:In addition to always looking for great systems engineers, SREs, and network engineers, we're particularly interested in exceptionally strong web front end developers, Postgres database expertise, and enterprise sales/sales engineers.https://www.cloudflare.com/join-our-teamThings we particularly value are a drive to complete projects, deep technical curiosity, and an interest in fixing the Internet.
                      
                  
      I actually had my first interview was told I passed it and they would schedule the next one with me within a couple days then never heard back.:(
                      
                  
      Always follow up if that happens. Things get lost and forgotten, and people sometimes forget who's side of the court the ball was in. It happens.
                      
                  
      Sad but true.I got a few interviews and the recruiters used special web-apps for the process and even then they didn't think about getting back and tell me it's done.And why should they? They get paid for good hires, not for telling the bad ones they aren't needed.We probably need more comments like the one of devnull42 to raise awareness.
                      
                  
      This wasn't "not telling the bad one that wasn't needed" -- it was "reviewer (who is our engineering manager for that department) liked him, and put notes to that effect in his file, and the next step is supposed to be in-house recruiter following up to do the next interviews".  The in-house recruiter didn't get the note, and there was no internal feedback loop to say it had been stalled.  We actually hired a (great) engineer on the data team after he followed up on a post like this months ago; I'm aware the process is broken, and we're trying to improve it.)We use jobscore.  I really wish we used lever.co to track this stuff instead.On the teams where I am more involved in hiring (i.e. not SRE), we separately track candidates after initial screening using Jira (which we use for everything else), so people don't get dropped.
                      
                  
      email me [email address redacted] -- I have no idea who you are in the system.
                      
                  
      I've sent an email (about 3 weeks ago) regarding the possibility of a summer placement to one your employees, been told that he/she put me into the "recruiting system" but unfortunately had no reply since. Any reason as to why that is?
                      
                  
      Your email address (based on your other posts) is not in jobscore (which we use to track applicants).If you want to apply to something, go through jobscore, so it's in that system.  Anything else tends to get lost :(

      Why a repost, word for word, of a post I added one year ago (although changing the email address)?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7512279
                      
                  
      I was quite intrigued by this position, but if it's a repost of yours I'm probably as confused as you are about what is going on.Did you stop pursuing that venture? E.g. it's someone you worked/were going to work with?Certainly makes me less excited about replying to the repost.
                      
                  
      I have no idea why this is here. There is no CTO anymore (I left) and there are more than 2 engineers.I highly doubt this is legit, but I am curious why there is a copy & paste (word for word) of a one year old job post.Perhaps you can email and tell me your results (my email is in my profile).

      Doubt any firm would even consider remote interns unless you want to "intern" doing data entry. Getting you caught up would take a tremendous amount of resources that is just not worth the effort.

      Clever (YC S12) - Full Stack Engineer - San FranciscoRight now the market for educational software is a mess.  Itâ€™s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schoolsâ€™ side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps theyâ€™re purchasing.  Teachers know thereâ€™s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.At Clever, weâ€™re working to change that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  Weâ€™ve grown fast: after two and a half years, weâ€™re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (15M kids), and 35,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:
-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software theyâ€™re using, and
-a single identity that students can use to see everything theyâ€™ve learned across multiple apps.Weâ€™re a team of 50 (22 engineers) based in downtown SF.  Weâ€™re looking for full-stack engineers who like:-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanetsCheck us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack, or check out what weâ€™re working on at https://github.com/clever.

      Clara Labs (https://claralabs.com/, YC S14) - San Francisco, Engineering, Full-TimeClara is building the simplest possible interface to getting work done.Every person on our team is involved in the thinking that creates their work - full stack in the broadest sense of the term. This means identifying, owning, and driving projects to completion.We believe shipping early and frequently builds better products. An extreme example: we scheduled thousands of meetings entirely manually for our first Clara customers before building any software at all.Accepting human dependency is the fastest way to building useful machine intelligence. The failure of intelligence products to date has fundamentally been a failure to build trust due to unreliability and lack of focus (think: Siri). Conversely, Clara has delivered a highly reliable, focused, and useful natural language interface from day one.Weâ€™re looking for frontend, backend, and machine learning engineers to join our early team.

      Pipemetrics - Lausanne, Switzerland - Local onlySenior developer, C / C++ / WindowsLooking for experienced developers to help expanding our existing product into a suite of complimentary products and services (https://bvckup2.com).  --

Basic requirements - Solid C/C++ with a focus on producing lean and efficient code; considertable experience developing and shipping software for the Windows platform.Good to have - Knowing one's way around Linux, both the development toolchain and the shell; PHP, JS, SQL; people skills for communicating with users.Nice to have - Embedded and kernel development experience.Ideally, you should be reasonably comfortable with all elements of a system that allows controlling a Windows app through an externally hosted web interface - from Windows, through the network to the PHP/SQL backend to the HTML/JS web frontend.  --

The company is built around the notion of "doing one simple thing, but doing it really well." This doesn't mean creating simplistic software, but rather having a single primary function that captures one specific user need and then providing a host of supporting features to make things simple and convenient. This is a fairly alien approach on Windows where the software still tends to compete on the length of the feature list first and foremost. However, the good news is that there is a substantial demand for simpler, but better-made software. This is what we do.Prior to founding Pipemetrics, I was the principal person behind Hamachi VPN service (http://swapped.cc/hamachi).  --
