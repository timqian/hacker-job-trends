San Francisco, CA - Zenbox. Software Engineer. [LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]We're a YC company wrangling SaaS to work together (as they should), starting by bringing the biggest apps our customers use right into Gmail. We've been growing our team over the past few months, and looking to add even more awesome people.We work with dozens of API's to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw available when helping customers.Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there's still so much polish and improvement possible.We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we've recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it's interesting.Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers.
We also explore some pretty awesome ways to escape from getting crushed under the heel of complexity, and we're all excited to start toying around with ideas like http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channe... for the frontend.This is both UI and backend work.Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Ruby, Javascript.sean @ zenboxapphttps://www.zenboxapp.com
                      
                  
      Twitch - twitch.tv - San Francisco, CA.Three years ago there was no "real" way to watch live gaming video online. Now we're the defacto and the likes of xbox and valve are realizing that and working very closely with us. This type of growth needs support!Devops Engineers - We're scaling at an insane rate! 3mm MAU increase over the last couple of months, up from 2mm MAU a few months ago, which was up from 1mm MAU a few months prior to that! As such nearly every aspect of our stack is being revved, automated and improved. We're looking for people that never do things three times, it is always scripted and solid by then. Come help us build intelligent request routing into our infrastructure, help us get our server build and deploy process down to a work of beauty. Everything is up for grabs here for the right candidates.Data Architects - Do you dream about large volumes of data? We have it! We're looking for engineers with tried and tested experience of modern storage mechanisms to help us scale out all data related things. Our vision is to have you build the platform for our stats guy (an absolute baller!) to go to town on. We want to build platforms that help us both with real time queries (recommendations for channels / vods, etc, to watch) and longer bulk queries (cohort analysis).Interested in either? Want to know more? Email me, Mike Ossareh, Director of Engineering: ossareh@twitch.tv
                      
                  
      Atlanta, GA - MailChimpI am hiring for two roles on the Infrastructure side:Systems/Coding:
http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/apply/6Il9br/Infrastructur...NOC/Networking:
http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/apply/8ZRfKP/NOC-Engineer....MailChimp is a unique place. We have ~3.5mm users, send ~6bn emails/month, and sit at ~80k queries/second hitting our dozens of database shards during a typical day. We are growing rapidly, adding 7000+ new users/day with that rate increasing every week. On the infrastructure side we do some neat stuff to support that scale and growth rate, working closely with developers to build and support our applications.The engineering teams are still small, our benefits are unmatched, and internally we function much like a startup aside from established stability and abundant resources. There are no sales people, no investors, no board, no phones, no useless meetings, and engineering teams are trusted to make good decisions with resources with minimal oversight.If interested, use the links above to apply. Your information will come directly to me.
                      
                  
      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside 
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.
  
  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit 
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why youâ€™re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com

      Just a friendly reminder about WFH.io (http://www.wfh.io), a site listing global full time remote / work from home (WFH) tech-related jobs.In July 2013 we added 36 jobs, with a breakdown as follows:27 Software Development4 System Administration2 Design2 Customer Support1 OtherAlso, it's still free to submit your job posting to WFH.io, so please do so! :)Thanks!
                      
                  
      The first job listing on your page, under "Top 5 requested jobs" being "Sr Software Developer - Cloud Servers" at Rackspace has already been filled according to the rackspace URL the website provides. It doesn't give a good impression if the first thing you look at isn't available anymore.
                      
                  
      You are right.  :(  I do scan remote links daily looking for non-200s, but that's obviously not robust enough.
                      
                  
      Also, some of them are not actually WFH, e.g. this one requires relocation to Portland: https://www.wfh.io/jobs/16/
                      
                  
      I'm pretty stringent about that -- if you click the employer's job link, you'll see:"We'll work with you wherever you are (in the US) or help you relocate to Portland, OR."
                      
                  
      My apologies, I misread that as "work with you to help you relocate".It's great to see a site dedicated to WFH. I wish you every success with it!
                      
                  
      No worries, and thanks!

Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a carâ€”Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension.2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Earlybird, Mozilla and many more).3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and internationalâ€”no need to learn German, everyone speaks English. Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.4. Easy work permissionsâ€”Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe.

      Hey guys, just a quick comment about the colors on versus.com. #bfbfbf is your text, and #f4f4f4 is the background. Those colors are so close together that its nearly impossible to read without really straining the eyes. I'd recommend going with a darker color for your text to provide better contrast. Good luck!

      REMOTE: Part or full time developer and support team memberWe're a small company selling software and services to a technical and demanding industry. Our international team is looking for someone who is up to learning something possibly completely new, and extending their coding abilities on varied systems that we're in the process of scaling.Tools we work with include: Python/Flask/PostgreSQL, C/C++, /Java (server side), AngularJS (frontend), OSX/Windows/iOS/Android appsYou will need to be available for working with our customers on the phone between at least 10am-3pm CET (Central European Time), and collaborating with our distributed dev team during some later hours some parts of the week (flexi-time). You should have good speaking english to take occasional support calls during the day - this is an important part of how we work, where all developers have direct access to customers. We'd also love to have a German speaker on board.Interns/Junior devs completely welcome to apply - if you are just learning to code, have a technical background in any field and can demonstrate genuine aptitude for independent learning please get in touch. This is a 100% remote position and some of us have kids while working from home so we're very family-friendly. It's also an excellent position for anyone studying.Email resume, github profile etc to hire.me.mex@gmail.com
                      
                  
      Could you elaborate a little bit on the industry you are servicing and/or the specific problem domains?also: where is the company located (i'm asking for tax, health insurance reasons etc.) ?
                      
                  
      We're US-based and this position is ideally suited for someone in Europe due to the timezone we need. Support is mostly troubleshooting installs remotely, and development focuses on networking and low-level media elements. A note on support: we work hard to try and automate support, so the reason we ask devs to take on support issues is that it helps us focus on not having to do support for an issue once we've automated/fixed it. We also love having a direct connection to every customer, it makes the work more meaningful (though we find it really interesting in itself).
                      
                  
      And are you looking for a direct employment of someone from europe or a contractor agreement? it is my understanding that it's quite a bit of paperwork for US companies if they have no local branch in a memberstate of the european union.i'm asking because it sounds interesting (and i'm german ;) ) and i'm looking for a new gig as a software developer right now.
                      
                  
      This is a contract opportunity at least to start with. Could you get in touch and we can talk more? I'd love to know what you're looking for and see if it's a match.
                      
                  
      After doing a quick google search of zuvikomx I'm pretty sure the company's located in Mexico City, Mexico.
                      
                  
      We were previously looking for someone in Mexico to help a local office there, we're US-based.
                      
                  
      Are you still looking for someone in Mexico?
                      
                  
      Yes absolutely, we'd be really happy to speak to anyone in Mexico.

      StormPulse is awesome and I would highly recommend working with Matt, Brad & co.
                      
                  
      These dudes are legit and they have interesting engineering problems.
                      
                  
      +1; Storm Pulse is my 2nd favorite startup in Austin!
                      
                  
      And your favorite?
                      
                  
      Heh, just saw this. Brian is my fiance and I run a funded startup here in Austin (see my profile, although we're about to rebrand.) So it's not a fair fight. ;)
                      
                  
      >B.S. in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, or related technical discipline requiredNo exceptions?
                      
                  
      Definitely exceptions.  I was a humanities major.  Listing edited. :)
                      
                  
      Actually, I meant is a degree really required?Personally, I left college with a couple of years left to go, when I realized I could make just as much money without a degree as with one, and I could teach myself anything I needed to know, anyway.(I haven't regretted it in 15+ years of professional programming, for what it's worth.)
                      
                  
      For flexible private-sector organizations like startups, 'X required' almost always means 'X or equivalent experience required'. Being bold enough to understand that and apply, explaining your equivalent experience, can be a positive signal.(I imagine there are exceptions among very bureaucratic and regulated agencies or government contractors. But even there, you may reach an individual hiring manager with both the wisdom and discretion to hire anyone with the right skills, regardless of credentials.)
                      
                  
      Also fine.

We've got cool clients, the most innovative product in the space and we're poised for big growth in the next few months.Things we don't do: crappy outbound traffic arbitrage links.We build products that are good for publishers, writers and readers. That's in our DNA.We're lean and nimble; have an awesome roadmap full of fun tech challenges; and looking to find the right person to lead our tech team. The stack? Currently, PHP, Nginx, Apache, Memecache, MySQL, jQuery, a dash of PostGRES. Future? Likely some Python, maybe Go, maybe Redis, maybe some NodeJS. Whatever makes sense.There will be some machine learning stuff, some big data, some UX challenges, etc. The ideal person is someone who is passionate about making online publishing better; who has track record of leading teams to ship quickly without burnout; and who wants to learn more - but doesn't make stack decisions based on the cool new tool they want to learn.http://contextly.com/jobs/What we offer: a fun challenge working on a product used by millions daily, great co-workers, significant equity.There's no timeframe on the hiring, so if it's something that sounds good for 3 months from now, drop us a line.Put CTO in the subject line and tell us a bit about yourself. info@contextly.com.

      AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure, down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Please visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.

      We have full time remote team members and all meetings etc are google hang outs but the current team all started in Seattle and we don't have a policy on fully remote new hires yet so I guess it is on a case by case basis.I think that it would be a "yes" for someone having a proven record on open source projects or published scientific work etc.

https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/vacancies/Also, right now I'm working as an engineer on our backend infrastructure team in NYC and want to specifically call out an opening we have on this team. The role description (at http://spoti.fi/13zEPmT) should give you some idea: my team is building the infrastructure that all devs at Spotify use to build their features and services on top of. Great way to make a big impact, and also involves playing with a lot of fun tech like Cassandra, LXC, and Docker :-)I've been at Spotify for a year and a half and it has been a great place to work as a developer. Let me just list the ways:    - Really smart people with very diverse professional and cultural backgrounds.
    - Problems that are actually pretty tough & challenging at scale.
    - A hacker culture, where solving or building things is what's valued.
    - Getting to travel between our offices and exploring new places.
    - Speaking of travel, 4-5 weeks of vacation depending on your location.
    - Excellent events with great music and bands (look up "Spotify Sessions")!

We also have all the standard benefits and things you'd expect (nice offices, health insurance, coffee, etc.), but those things above are what I think have really made working here unique.Feel free to reach out to me directly (rohan@spotify.com) if you have any questions or want to talk, or feel free to fire off an application through the jobs site.

http://knowitowl.theresumator.com/apply/Do you want to solve:
A problem with scale. Insurance is a $2 trillion industry. Thatâ€™s 36 times larger than Google and Facebook combined. Insurers pay their aging sales force a mint to sell insurance the old-fashioned way (with paper, face-to-face). Weâ€™re going to change this.A problem thatâ€™s socially important. Nobodyâ€™s helping people figure out insurance â€“ and thatâ€™s bad. Under-insured medical problems contribute to over half of all personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures. Weâ€™re going to deliver social impact.A problem in desperate need of a new approach. The consumer problem in insurance is deceptively simple: insurance is hard to sell because people donâ€™t want to think about bad things like death and illness. Insurers just throw money at the problem: advertising, hefty commissions, pushy sales agents. Weâ€™re introducing a new approach.Weâ€™re looking to build our team with people who understand the importance of what weâ€™re doing and want to apply their talent and energy to solving a Big Problem. Weâ€™re searching for Davids ready to take on Goliath. Come join Virgil and the KnowItOwl team to bring the $2 trillion insurance industry into the 21st century.

      You're a kind soul.The login was rather convoluted, and it implored me to keep re-registering my book. So I wound up with three registrations of my book. The system didn't record when I completed a practice test or quiz, so I couldn't access old work. The tests/quizzes themselves were often missing exponents in the answer keys; additionally, there were a few with contradictory answers (on one, it said "(B) is correct... (B) is obviously incorrect", or something to that effect).It also crashed and booted me in the middle of practice tests twice.

      Hey! I adore Quartz and read it daily.Though I've done UX testing and (the non-coding side of) design for a couple companies (one YC startup, one Boost, the second being my own), I don't think I'm qualified to work as a visual designer.Before I worked in startups, I worked in journalism-- a Detroit business magazine and at the U of Michigan newspaper. My degrees are in econ and history. Is there any chance you're hiring for other positions, writer or otherwise?I'm really passionate about reporting on the intersection of innovation and policy, but I'll write about anything. I'd just love to be a part of your organization.
                      
                  
      Please, no recruiters or agencies. Thanks

Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.

      San Francisco, CA.  Java Engineer No remote.
2-5 years experience Java, Amazon experience, OO architecture exposure sql/mysql,  some Hudson or Jenkins exposure, hopefully exposed to Puppet or Chef, great would be some build tools like Ant.
Contact Robert at rbocknek@birst.com
                      
                  
      A couple recommendations:- "2-5 years experience Java" - There are vastly different ways to use Java, so someone like me would be in the 2-5 years of equivalent experience for things like Android, Swing or JavaFX development.  JavaEE has progressed immensely and while the cool kids aren't using it, annotation-based development has led to the same sort of "convention-over-configuration" style programming and a lot of code generation from a fairly small amount of code.  You don't have to generate 10 classes and interfaces for each EntityBean (EJB1 and EJB2) anymore.- "... tools like Ant" - Managing dependencies in Java can be a real headache, so you want to specify a tool-chain that has dependency management.  Say something like "Ant+Ivy" or "Maven".  For integration with Hudson/Jenkins, Maven is superior but either will work.- "OO Architecture" needs to be melded with an MVC/MVP pattern for big projects.  These architectural patterns help immensely with testing and code management (plus watch for package tangle in Sonar).- What's the rest of your tool-chain?  You left a lot of holes and it's not clear from your ad which technologies you use and which you want to use.  For comparison, here is my toolchain (I could give you more detail but not here):  - JavaEE
  - WildFly
  - PostgreSQL
  - CouchDB
  - Maven
  - Jenkins
  - Sonar
  - Nexus
  - Vagrant
  - Ansible
  - JUnit and plugins (XmlUnit, DBUnit, etc)
  - Selenium2 (on the grid server and managed by Jenkins)

- "Amazon experience" is not very specific.  I think we'll all assume you mean AWS, but there are APIs for running shops and for using mechanical turk.Hope this helps!
