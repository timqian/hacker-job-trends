      I'll mention something that our team just helped launch this past week. If you're seeking asylum in the US, previously you could check the status of your case by fax, phone, or in person, but you couldn't check online. Now, you can check the status of your asylum application online: https://twitter.com/USCIS/status/1090701308636684289Things like that might not sound like rocket science--and it isn't--but improving services that lots of people rely on is deeply meaningful work. It's non-partisan stuff and our job is to help fix public-facing services that millions of people rely on.
                      
                  
      Thank you for your service to our country!This is awesome. My USCIS just not for asylum applications, but everything else.

      Pex | Multiple positions | Downtown, Los Angeles | US-ONLY REMOTE or ONSITE, FULL-TIME | $105,000 Minimum Salary + Equity | https://angel.co/pexeso/jobsPex built a suite of products with focus on analytics and rights management around audio-visual content targeted at content creators, marketers and rights holders.We're looking for senior engineers for positions listed bellow:  - front-end (React and Redux)  
  - signal processing (mostly R&D)  
  - DBA architect (Postgres [with Citus], FoundationDB, others)  
  - Go and Java for work on our backend systems  
  - C/C++, Rust to help us optimize our algorithms

Remote is only available for US based candidates. For all employees, we offer:  - equal salary within US (no matter where you live you are paid as in LA)
  - 30 days of paid vacation
  - fully covered health benefits (gold/platinum) [70% coverage for your family]
  - 3 months paid parental leave
  - $300 monthly allowance for co-working or commuting
  - covering all costs of visiting conferences

If you want to learn more, reach out directly to me at r@pex.comWell, a contractor is a very different thing. They don't have the same rights and we can't offer them the same benefits as we do to our employees. We don't want to have second class citizens on our team.That said, we already do work with some contractors outside of US. But the above applies and we are trying to find a way to incorporate in their countries so we can equalize the compensations (salary, health benefits, stock options, ...).Would we not care about our people, this would be a no brainer.
                      
                  
      Netflix doesn't have remote workers. Yes, they compensate for every benefit in cash. Because they have abundance of it.There is a reason why startups give equity and lower salaries. They can't afford to compete with incumbents. Plus we want all our employees to be and feel equal. That means to share all the upsides of the company through options grants, have great healthcare, time off, ...
                      
                  
      options grants - you can give options to contractors.great healthcare - you can reimburse the costs for insurance.time off - you can just give them time off. :)etc...I think you can make your employees and contractors feel equal.
                      
                  
      Option grants - they are not the same for employees and contractors. And there are huge differences between them for the receivers [0]Healthcare - companies have different options than individuals. Different countries offer different quality. And many will opt-out from expensive plans that have great coverage in favor of extra cash [1]. However, when things happen, they don't have the proper coverage and end up in situations that are very hard to recover from (we been there).Time off - this is again not the same thing. PTO has many important protections for employees and has built in rules in the law. Contractor has no right for any of it.and etc.Your suggestions are generally valid, but we prefer our employees to be at equal standing with the same rights and same benefits.[0] https://buchwaldlaw.com/2016/10/stock-option-the-differences...

Citizenship is a job requirement.We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.You can email me at users.sf.net, with account name albert.

You would join the POI-Acquisition team as a Software Engineer, working with the Data Scientists to acquire and process hundreds of POIs on a daily basis (and more as we keep growing!).

      45K tops and you decided to setup in the center of Madrid. That's either condemning the worker to a long commute or a low salary.It is neither condemning our workers to a long commute nor a low salary. 
Everyone at Geoblink has flexible working so can pick the days and hours they work. Moreover we all can work from home whenever we want so commuting is never an issue. In terms of salary it is actually a competitive offer since the cost of living etc in Madrid is much lower than in places like London XD.That being said, if anyone is interested but they think the salary is too low to live in Madrid please do email me so that I can update our research and make sure we stay competitive.We'd love to hear from you!
