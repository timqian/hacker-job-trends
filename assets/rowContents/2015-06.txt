SpaceX flight software is hiring! Most openings are in Los Angeles, but we're also looking for senior engineers in SF and Seattle.We have openings in a bunch of different flavors:* C/C++/realtime systems - http://www.spacex.com/careers/position/7464* C++/physics simulation - http://www.spacex.com/careers/position/4337* Frontend web development - http://www.spacex.com/careers/position/7374* Java/Python/Go automation services* Dev ops - http://www.spacex.com/careers/position/7579There are a ton of more openings listed in the career site, peruse and feel free ask me any questionshttp://www.spacex.com/careers/listAnd for a little inspiration, here's a video of our last landing attempt -- the magic sauce was mostly software!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amRPtyhIzkI&spfreload=10
                      
                  
      I was interviewing with you guys and we got about 3 rounds in, then contact with your org completely disappeared. I figured it had to do with a the big launch you just had, but still nothing after following up. Is that normal?
                      
                  
      Which position?
                      
                  
      Are you guys doing anything to improve the reports of poor work/life balance?  I really feel like you'd attract a lot more engineers that way, and get higher quality work out of them?
                      
                  
      Wondering the same thing... Really bizarre, unfortunate stories coming out of SpaceX.
                      
                  
      We're actively trying to change the culture and management is onboard. What this means is that not working long hours isn't a negative in performance reviews and advancement. However, people often feel compelled/pressured to work the long hours because a lot of their peers do it.
                      
                  
      >  because a lot of their peers do itThen just shut down the office and lock the doors at 6pm. This is how things are done in Europe and we (and our families) are pretty happy with it.
                      
                  
      I guess the candidates are still limited to one particular country on one particular planet, right?
                      
                  
      To be fair, that is not really SpaceX's fault. It is due to the U.S. laws that make an overly broad definition of what is a weapon, and an overly optimistic belief that the technology can be hidden from dedicated spies.Strictly speaking, they could hire non-U.S. persons, but that requires a specific individual exemption from the state department. I don't know how hard it is, but I suspect it is only something they would try to do if they really wanted you (i.e. they recruit you, not you apply to them).
                      
                  
      There are certainly places where ITAR could be described as "overly broad" (for instance, the infrared cameras used by firefighters are limited due to ITAR restrictions), but the only difference between an Falcon 9 and an ICBM is the bit on the end...
                      
                  
      That said, a large part of the world has little need for just a different variation of their existing ICBM's.
                      
                  
      Best planet in the Solar System, though!
                      
                  
      No, the best planet is Pluto, no matter what the IAU says.
                      
                  
      If pluto was a planet we'd have to memorize way more than nine planetshttp://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html
                      
                  
      I'll take that over the inconsistency of the "clearing the neighborhood" rationale for Pluto's exclusion.
                      
                  
      I wouldn't be so assured.
                      
                  
      > BASIC QUALIFICATIONS: Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer ScienceThat is shutting out a very real group of extremely talented people. You can't teach initiative and passion.
                      
                  
      I noticed that GPA is also required for recruiter applications; SpaceX is a really interesting company that's been on my radar for a long time, but seeing this is a huge turnoff.  The best recruiters I know probably don't remember their GPA from college and some of them were so busy traveling around the world exploring during college that their GPA would only be a tiny detail in the overall narrative of their lives.   Seems like a very short-sighted requirement (and means otherwise qualified and impressive candidates may never apply).
                      
                  
      For what they are doing, a very strong background in data structures and memory management is required, at least in so far as the code running on the rocket itself.Very few people learn that on their own, and even fewer learn it to the proficiency level they need.
                      
                  
      I'm going to go out on a limb here and ask if you think that because you've had very, very few people without a degree apply for that kind of position? Your ad is ensuring that you'll never see the people that have learned it. As a self-taught programmer, I don't apply to listings with this requirement, even if I have everything else they're looking for, because it's just as much an indicator for me as it is for you. I just want you to be aware that you're excluding a very special niche group that could do wonders for any business.
                      
                  
      I don't have application demographics in front of me, but I'd wager that you're correct, most people without a degree don't apply to that position.However, that doesn't actually speak to what I was saying. My claim refers to the population of non-formally educated developers as a whole.You might fall into the small portion of the population where you do have the requisite knowledge and skill. However, I think you're missing key element to recruiting, that took me a long time myself to understand.Recruiting is a numbers game. Finding good people is hard, but the best way to find them is A) have competitive compensation, and B) volume. If the signal to noise ratio of college educated applicants is 50:1 and the ratio for non-college educated applicants is 100:1, then as long as there isn't a shortage of college applicants, it improves the recruitment process to require a college degree.
                      
                  
      I think you're missing fapjacks point.  its not that you're not letting a few people in that are just as capable, its that you're not finding all of the top talent possible.  looking around my organization I would say of the people that one out of every 50 people who are hired are observably way more talented than all of the other engineers in the org (ignoring years of experience and strictly speaking about talent + measured output).  half of those do not have degrees whereas 90% of engineers in the org do.so if youre looking for top talent, you are limiting yourself by a significant amount by only looking for people with degrees.  looking further into this, if the top talent you do have doesnt have many people to challenge them, then they will leave because they either feel like they arent progressing or feel like they get frustrated by the others not being able to contribute at a level that they expect.

      Do you need Mathematicians?
                      
                  
      Well, we're an engineering company, so it'd have to be math with a practical slant. Do you have a background in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analysis (all done in matlab or python)?

      Are internships paid?
                      
                  
      Hi Jeff - yes, internships are paid.
                      
                  
      Scott O'Neil seems like a great guy to head this team and effort. I wish I had more (any) stats & analysis experience under my belt, would apply for this in a second.
                      
                  
      If I were in the states I would pay you to let me to this kind of work :-)
                      
                  
      Are you considering remote candidates (I'm in Europe)?
                      
                  
      Yes, we do consider remote candidates.
                      
                  
      I almost wanna apply just for the job title.

      Telenor Digital - Oslo, Norway or Trondheim, Norway or Amsterdam, Netherlands - Full-timeWe're the R&D Tech company within a big telco with branches in the Nordics, Eastern Europe and Asia; with ~150 million customers and counting. We're rethinking about how a telco should look like in the 21th century and roll out projects around the globe, so if you'd like to travel there's definitely an opportunity. We're looking to hire a bunch of great software engineers (C++, Java, NodeJS or frontend):Team Software telco (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/48915513?trk=biz-overvie...) -  Re-inventing the telco by building a modern communications infrastructure for voice and data communications fully at home in the Internet and modern distributed/virtualized/containerised/etc. architecture.No specific team (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/48347266?trk=biz-overvie...) - Focused on a variety of our consumer products, which can change pretty quickly. Some focus areas that are in the pipeline: health solutions for South East Asia, advertisement supported phones for Bangladesh, consumer cloud storage (rolled out in Nordics & Malaysia), fashion, IoT, etc.
                      
                  
      Any chance for a [partial] remote from Europe? (for the right candidate, C++)
                      
                  
      For the right candidate  anything is possible :-)  However at this time everyone on the team is mostly located in Oslo so this is something we would have to consider as a special case.  We're not primarily an C++ shop (we're not primarily anything really), but we do use some C++ in parts of the realtime processing code.  We do occasionally use objective C when writing for iOS, but we haven't done that for many months now.   Primarily we're using javascript, java (for serverside signalling and handset android apps), various scripting languages (python, shell, ...) and whatever is useful to solve  the problem at hand.
                      
                  
      But this applies to software telco team, right. Other teams can use different stacks.
                      
                  
      We have some remotes (me included), it depends a bit on the team, but as long as you're OK with ~20% onsite it should be discussable.
                      
                  
      One week a month? 3 weeks a quarter? Travel and lodging reimbursed?
                      
                  
      Hello, is there a way I can contact you through email? Thanks a bunch!

      Planet Labs (http://planet.com/) in San Francisco, CA has a large number of positions open.  We're a collection of electrical, mechanical, aerospace, software, science, etc. folks looking to image the whole planet on a daily basis with a large number of small satellites. It's a terrific bunch of folks doing what we call "agile aerospace".I've personally been with the company for almost a year, working on "Mission Control", an internal web app for managing the satellites and make life easier on our "Spaceship Captains" -- the operators who manage them. This is definitely one of the most interesting and fun roles I've had in my career (and I've had a few).Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects.  We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software.  Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we're growing.Some gigs are onsite only, others may be available to remote workers.Full list of jobs at https://www.planet.com/careers/#openings

      FreeAgent, Edinburgh or REMOTE (UK)http://www.freeagent.comWe're looking for software engineers of all levels and technical managers to come and work on our flagship product FreeAgent. We're a growing team of 80, based in Edinburgh but with remote staff around the UK (5 engineers are fully remote).We have a lot of happy customers (40,000+, NPS=76!), a lot of traffic (13 million+ page views/mo), and some lovely staff to work alongside, learn from and have fun with. We invest a lot of time in our platform (code health, scalability, security) as well as working on new features, which is nice.Our engineers tend to be full stack, but weâ€™re seeing people move towards more specialist work these days, such as front-end programming (we're doing a lot of React.js, primarily on our iOS app), our real-time accounting engine, data science. People play to their strengths really. Our stack is intentionally straightforward. It's sensible and sustainable. Javascript aside, we mainly write Ruby alongside MySQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, Puppet.We are looking for UK-based full-time staff right now, but we'd also be interested to chat to UK-based freelancers interested in a longer-term contract (e.g. 6 months+).Job listings and applications via http://freeagent.workable.com

      If the company also happens to sponsor visas for remote workers, this could be an interesting case of 'dogfooding'.
                      
                  
      I just checked their site and it seems that if they do dogfood, it's only partial, because they only offer the I-485, which is the last step of the employment-based permanent residency application process. Before the I-485, you have PWD, LCA, and I-140.

      Could you be more specific about the location? "SF Peninsula" covers a lot of ground, and the jobs page is equally vague. Crunchbase says Portola Valley, but for those who care about commute time, this isn't a minor detail. Thanks.
                      
                  
      Sorry, this is vague because it's liable to change. Currently we are in Portola Valley. Within a few months or so, we're likely to relocate slightly -- possibly to Redwood City, but possibly elsewhere. We'll definitely be staying min-Peninsula, likely near Caltrain.On the subject of commuting, we're open to telecommuting one or two days per week.

      Distilled (www.distilled.net) is hiring in London, New York City (NYC) and Seattle WA - all permanent, full-time roles. I'm the CEO - hit me up by email with any questions (email in profile).We have a whole host of open positions:
https://www.distilled.net/jobs/In particular, we would very much like to talk to digital marketing / SEO consultants in any of our cities.We recently had an all-hands email thread where the whole team discussed what brought them to Distilled, and why they are still here. It got many great replies (including a number talking about how people's friends had typically had 2-3 jobs in the time they'd been with us), but this one stood out:"A combination of an informal environment, freedom, and high expectations - I wanted a place where I could be myself and grow doing/learning things that I was passionate about, while having lots of smart people around me to collaborate with in doing so. I came from a huge, strictly regimented and siloed company, and was fed up with being told "that's a great idea, but it's not your job", and Distilled seemed to be the polar opposite."

      Washington DC - Nava - Reimagining technology in government - Onsite preferredI'm part of a small team of engineers from Silicon Valley that came out to DC last year to help fix Healthcare.gov. In the process, we learned a ton about the world of government software. Many people know about the disastrous Healthcare.gov launch, but there's a long list of huge technical problems that impact everyone in the US. A few examples: people are dying because the Veteran's Administration is six months behind in processing claims, the IRS system goes down for regular maintenance every night, and the Social Security Administration is still paying benefits to millions of deceased Americans because their data is so poorly managed.Over the past year, our team has seen an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people, and we've started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.You probably remember the initial launch of Healthcare.gov, but you might not have seen our relaunch in the news. Thatâ€™s a good thing. Here are a few facts we can share: our new insurance application is processing 70% of all apps coming through the marketplace, converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, and is mobile-friendly (20% of applications were started on mobile). App 2.0 was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) ever hosted on Amazon AWS, and the login system we just launched saves taxpayers $70 million a year. (Here's a Wired article from last summer about us: http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/)Weâ€™re continuing to rebuild and improve Healthcare.gov while expanding in bold new directions, bringing talented engineers (we're mainly Stanford, Google, and Y Combinator alums) to DC, the place where we're needed most. If you'd like to build software that reimagines how millions of Americans interact with their government, weâ€™d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.com.Specifically, weâ€™re looking for:
- a product manager with a technical background
- senior devops engineers
- senior full-stack engineers
                      
                  
      Amazon | AmazonUI (AUI) | Seattle; San Francisco | Onsite | Full-TimeAUI is the Front-end platform being adopted on Amazon.com. We are modernizing the company's front end code base, while diving deep on latency, performance, API design, user experience, and cross browser/device compatibility. Basically, we need people who can build libraries, not just use them.Our team is incredibly customer-centric. For any given situation, we have to make the right choice on behalf of the folks using our platform -- and we have to do it at scale. That may sound cliche, but within the next hour AUI will be used to generate tens of millions of page views. And that's just in the US. Worldwide, we're used on about 90% of requests across all device categories.It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of opportunity. For example, we can run experiments that change almost every page on Amazon.com. We can also impact the page load time for the entire site. Have you ever tried to figure out why your site is 6ms slower? We have.We use these tools (but don't expect you to know all of them):
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Perl, GitAnd to give you an idea of who you will be working with, the folks responsible for this articles are on our team:
http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...If you're interested, drop us an email. Heck, you can even drop us an email if you're in Seattle or San Francisco and you just want to have coffee:    function getEmailAddr( company ) {
        company = company.replace(/\.com$/i, "").toLowerCase();
        return String.fromCharCode(97, 117, 105, 45, 104, 110) + "@" + company + ".com";

We're looking to add two or three more to help us build out the platform faster. Current tech stack is Ruby, Rails, AngularJS, Postgres, and Redis.Senior Software Engineer - Looking for full-stack engineers who can help us expand the platform. Upcoming projects include refactoring key components into services, building out automated call scoring using machine classifiers, deeper integrations with other services, and improving our analytics tools.Senior Mobile Engineer - We have aspirations of building native mobile applications, but nobody to do it. Looking for someone with experience building apps from the ground up, part of which will be scoping what features the app should include. No strong opinions on pure native vs hybrid vs Cordova vs Xamarin, but regardless there will eventually be some WebRTC components. Prefer to start with iOS, as that's where most of our customers are.More at http://www.callrail.com/careers, or email me directly.

      Heap | San Francisco, CA, USA | Intern, Remote (from anywhere in the world), or Visa (from Canada/Australia/Mexico) all welcome | Software EngineerHeap is a team of 12 building tools that help 3000+ companies make data-driven decisions and create better experiences for their users.Other analytics tools require you to define events upfront and manually instrument code. Instead, Heap automatically captures every user interaction in your app. This lets our customers analyze data instantly and retroactively, without writing code.We're eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day. Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.How we work:Happy Customers > Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be "pure."Vision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.Writing > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.We'd love to hear from you at jobs@heapanalytics.com.

      Tourbuzz - http://www.tourbuzz.net - Atlanta, GATourbuzz is a leader in the real estate photography and listing marketing space, now serving 2M+ unique visitors a month.We're bootstrapped, profitable, growing fast, debt-free, and in a brand new office, all with only 10 people. This is a great opportunity to join a successful product team that's still very early and playing in a huge market.We are looking for full-stack engineers (PHP/Postgres/Angular) to help lead development of major new functionality.Apply online: http://about.tourbuzz.net/careers/
                      
                  
      I'm a little confused by your careers page (mainly since you mentioned PHP specifically, which seems like it would be tied to the Lead Software Developer role) but there's also a Rails  Engineer position mentioned so I'm curious about which direction the team is heading (towards more Rails or more PHP?). I'm mainly curious because I'm more of a PHP developer (but interested in doing work in Ruby and Rails too).Also, I'm currently in Georgia Tech's Online Masters in Computer Science program and am kind of curious about the Atlanta area (if you can share a little more about life in the city).Congrats on your current successes so far :-)!
                      
                  
      Our original application was build in PHP about 7 years ago, but we have code in a variety of languages including PHP, Flash, Java, Obj-C/Swift, Ruby, Javascript, among others.Today's software landscape is so complex that you're forced to use multiple languages on an ongoing basis. As we've built out additional services, it makes for a perfect opportunity for us to let our team experiment & improve skills with new languages where appropriate. We are very dedicated to making Tourbuzz a place where our team can learn new things and improve their skills.Sometimes it takes more time, but it makes the day fun and brings additional benefits as new languages and technologies teach you new ways to look at a problem. My experiments with Clojure taught me things that changed the way I approach problems even in PHP!
                      
                  
      Nice to see your name pop up Alan! Looks like things are going well :)
                      
                  
      Thanks! C'mon back to Atlanta and bring like 500+ engineers with you, we really need them -- the ATL tech scene has absolutely blown up over the past few years :)
                      
                  
      No H1B possibility? I really like what you're doing.
                      
                  
      Thanks! We haven't really looked into it recently, but I'm not opposed. Reach out to me and we can discuss.

      Gradescope - https://gradescope.com Berkeley, CA | on-site onlyLearning has been assessed in the same way for decades: instructors give out assignments, tediously grade them by hand, and return them to students. With this process, instructors gain little insight into their studentsâ€™ knowledge. Simply measuring the frequency of a specific mistake requires painstaking tallying. Answering the question â€œWhat concepts are my students struggling with?â€� is practically impossible.Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: for example, we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time.Our product has been used to grade over 3.5 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. Weâ€™ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time hires to join the founding team of two PhDs and professor from Berkeley CS. Over the next few months, weâ€™re looking to expand our user base tenfold, and roll out advanced features including autograding, analytics, and more. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity.Weâ€™re currently hiring for two positions: Full-stack Engineer and UI DesignerIf youâ€™re interested, please email jobs@gradescope.com

We're a Madrid based start up and we're looking for software engineers to expand our team.To give you a high level overview, our Clojure platform runs on AWS that serves as a "central server" for other components such as a back-office web app, public website, kiosks, mobile apps (Android and iOS), etc. The kiosk is a ClojureScript/Om web application interacting with a local web server. In the  back-office web app we show events as they arrive into the central server given an overview of what's going on in the whole system.- Some of the interesting problems we're working on:    * System modularity
    * Data security in the kiosks
    * Unreliable communication with a central server over weak links (mobile networks)
    * Kiosk offline support (and all its complexity, e.g. data synchronization)
    * Kiosk communication with hardware components (designed and developed by the "Hardware Team")
    * etc

- Tools and languages:    * Clojure / ClojureScript (Om)
    * PostgreSQL / H2 / SQLite
    * Amazon Web Services (EC2, RDS)
    * ZeroMQ

We really love Clojure and the ideas behind the language, we try to follow a event based (log like) approach in our infrastructure, avoiding the usual "update in place" pattern.If this seems interesting we would like to hear from you, please send your CV to:(str \i \p \@ "ride-on" \. \e \s)
                      
                  
      I am sorry, I cannot find you online.What you guys do ?
                      
                  
      Hi,Didn't get any notification about your reply. Apologies for the delay.We're a startup initially focused implementing a platform for a bike sharing system (usually installed as a public one), with other kiosk related projects in the pipeline.If this seems interesting, please send your details and we can get in touch.Cheers,

  still relocation may be preferred.
                      
                  
      > REMOTE OKThis is one big lie, company policy is to bring people to the office.
                      
                  
      I am not sure why would you say that. The company has a big chunk of people working from remote locations all over the world, not only developers but also managers.The fact that the possibility to work remotely is evaluated based on the candidate experience, the location (eg. cost to the team to meet in person), timezone, and the location of the rest of the team, does not mean hiring locally is a policy. It is completely up to the team with very few exceptions.
                      
                  
      I was told that it is indeed company policy to have employees in the office. There are only very few remote workers, and new hires are relocated to the next office location, with very few exceptions. Once there, one can basically forget about working remotely, because telecommuting is "only an exception under special circumstances".
                      
                  
      Whoever told you that, it is incorrect information. There are remote workers at all levels of the organization.You should not confuse that with "every position is open  to be hired remote". There are teams that are setup for that, others that are not. Even for the same position, it depends a lot on the candidate.About telecommuting, we call that home-office and has nothing to do with "remotes". It only applies to people working in office locations (obviously). You can work from home if you have a reason for it (something delivered, big cold but feeling well, sick child, etc.), but it is not like "I am not in the mood of going to the office today so I stay home".
                      
                  
      Awesome. And then your team is located in Beijing, Nuremberg, Prague or wherever and you're to come to a different office for no reason whatsoever. Then you spend your whole day at the office communicating over IRC or mail for the sole reason of having your ass in an office chair.

I was working for a start-up called LucidMedia Networks (hence the "lmn" in the e-mail address below), which got acquired by Videology.

The Baltimore office also has a team on a large .NET stack as well, but Java teams are spread across both offices. We have some big projects in the works involving big data and volume as we scale globally and consolidate platforms into best of breed. The Reston office is located right next to the Silver Line metro station.Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com.I actually got hired through a HN "Who is Hiring" thread, and I hired 2 people through these threads.

Shipped in 1996, we're not a startup, but most of that code is gone now, and we're keeping things interesting with work spanning desktop (ign.com), mobile web, iOS, Android, and consoles (Xbox One & PS4 native apps).I'd never thought of it as a value before joining 4 years ago, but there's a lot of happiness derived from a strong common ground (e.g. a passion for games & entertainment) that's not directly related to roles across the company.Good hunting.Lead Software Engineer
