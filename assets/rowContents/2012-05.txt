If "INTERN", "REMOTE", or "H1B" candidates are not welcome to apply to your position, you should not use those words in your post. That defeats the purpose of using those key words if those candidates are welcome.For example, if I am looking for H1B opportunities, ctl+f finds basically every listing because those who aren't willing to accept H1B say, "no H1B". If you don't accept these candidates, the convention assumes that by default. Don't explicitly say it.

      New York, NY (we'll cover relo except no H1B) - http://fundinggates.com/jobsWe're a well-funded (angel, strategic - not VC), pre-revenue (just starting development, please help me! :D) company in NYC hiring awesome Rails and JS (Ember is nice, but not necessary) developers.We believe strongly in quiet work environments, work whenever, wherever you want (http://www.gorowe.com), the best tools money can buy (unlimited computer/desk budget), 20% time to do whatever you want (but you must share it with the team), hiring smart people and getting out of their way, and generally making the best software company in the world.We're hiring for engineers #1, 2, 3 - so at this time our core team should be either in NYC, or relocatable (we'll cover it!). As we grow the core team we'll be more flexible and able to take the culture hit a remote person brings, but not at this time, sorry!I hope to hear from you. rogish [at] fundinggates dot com
                      
                  
      Factual is hiring in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai. Local candidates preferred, but remote work is possible for exceptional U.S. candidates. Full-time only. H1B is okay for very strong, non-remote applicants.Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider, so that developers, startups, and big companies can focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We believe in openness and transparency rather than proprietariness and obfuscation.
We have a terrific team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense).In late 2010, we raised a Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz, and our customers and partners include Facebook, Newsweek, Yelp, and Blekko. We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.We have job openings for software engineers of all levels. You would ideally know Java and/or Clojure, and you'll get bonus points for experience with machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.If you're interested in the Bay Area office, it just opened in December of 2011 and is very small, so you'd have a significant influence on the culture there.You can email me personally at leo -at- factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:Palo Alto Software Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Software engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Data Engineer: http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews

      Is there any particular reason you have positions with "engineer" in title that have nothing to do with even the most watered-down meaning of engineering? I'm looking at Happiness Engineer in particular. I realize tech support isn't the most glamorous of titles, but it's at least somewhat descriptive. Similarly, Account Engineer is a client-facing sales position with no technical component.
                      
                  
      Many Happiness Engineers write significant amounts code as well as respond to customer requests.  Also, much of what we do (as a company) is data-driven.  Since we apply scientific methodology to our support and CRM systems & processes, I think it works.That being said, our job titles aren't exactly hard and fast representations of what we do day-to-day.Check out the subtitles here for examples:
 http://automattic.com/about/
                      
                  
      Understood on the happiness engineering role.Don't get me wrong, I think you can give yourselves any title you want, but when listing job postings you're just creating barriers by using non-descriptive, non-standard titles. Your potential applicants have to check the job description for "Account Engineer" to see if this is something they would be interested in (for most it won't be), if someone was actually looking for a client/account director role they might not notice this one because of the "engineer" part, and if someone was looking for a blended support/coding role they might miss "Happiness Engineer" while scrolling down the page.
                      
                  
      Lots of things might happen based on any non-standard terminology, but in general it's not something we worry about.  It's meant to be a little fun, a little different, and attract people that are a little fun and a little different.If someone wants an account director job at Automattic and never makes their way the Account Engineer link, that's okay.  If someone is a bit intrigued by our non-standard titles and looks a bit closer at them because they stand out, that's cool, too.Anything that isn't normal might confuse people.  The goal of our jobs page isn't to confuse the fewest people possible.

      San Francisco, CA (Mission District) - awe.sm - H1B okayWe're building conversion tracking for social media: think "Sendgrid for social media".What's that mean? It means we're building a platform that lets other companies abstract away a complex problem that lots of people have been reinventing the wheel for: measuring traffic, page views, signups and sales generated by users sharing with each other on Twitter, Facebook et al. We have a bunch of APIs and are building more all the time, as well as a GUI that attempts to make our data easy to use.We're hiring front-end engineers, back-end engineers, and those who fall into both categories, who we call "full stack" engineers:http://awe.sm/jobsOn the back-end, we use a variety of languages including PHP and Ruby (and bash) to build high-performance, high-volume, real-time data collection and processing systems, connecting to a bunch of different data stores including MySQL, Redis and Sphinx. We are more concerned with the "smart and gets things done" type than a specific line on your resume, and are willing and eager to provide training and mentorship, both internal and external.We're a team of 13, rising to 14-16 once we hire you people. Our perks include offices with an awesome view ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) at 22nd and Mission, catered lunch 3x a week, and a company IRC server, which should tell you a lot about the kind of devs we are.

      I had a bad experience with Two Sigma in 2007 - After spending half an hour on the phone, and then a further two hours writing code for a couple of programming problems, I never hear back from either the hiring manager or the recruiter. It didn't hurt me so much that I wasn't selected, rather they consider ~5 minutes of their time to compose a rejection email to be more valuable than ~2 hours of my time.
                      
                  
      I had a similar experience with them in 2009. I went through the same first interview plus the problems plus another technical interview. The did, however, call me back and invite me for an on-site interview. While awaiting the details, I was informed by the HR rep that the on-site interview would not take place because his boss nixed my application due to my GPA* being too low. Why didn't they say so in the first place before wasting all that time?* I had graduated 4 years earlier. Many companies don't care about GPA at that point.

      San Francisco, fulltime systems/ops and engineering, Causes - http://www.causes.com/joinusAt Causes, use your programming powers to help nonprofits effect change on the world! Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 12-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc. Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from - every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer- last month I said we were hoping to finish our Rails 3.0.11 upgrade soon. I'm happy to announce that not only have we landed on 3.2.3, but we needed some upstream patches to get our site working -- so we're on bleeding edge Rails. We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. Come get your SASS on!- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselvesCauses is a great place to better yourself and better the world. We're particularly looking for a systems/ops/network engineer to help wrangle our colo. Apply through the site or adam@causes.com if interested!
                      
                  
      Cambridge, MA (or REMOTE). Full-time.Do you like low-level systems programming? Does the idea of hacking on an old-school graphics demo that fits into a DOS MBR in your free time appeal to you? Does "Dazed and confused, but trying to continue" mean anything to you? Have you ever told a joke whose punch line was a git command? If you've answered yes to any of the above, I think we'll be fast friends -- and we want to hear from you.We're looking for engineers who are excited to work on technology that most people will tell you is impossible: updating an OS kernel while it is running. Help us bring rebootless kernel updates to Linux, as well as new operating system kernels and other parts of the software stack. You must have prior experience with operating systems, including kernel programming, debugging, porting, memory management, and/or virtualization. Experience with compilers is also relevant.About us:
We're a small, tight-knit team of twelve men and women that enjoy working on hard technology problems. We were recently acquired by Oracle, and are eager to take advantage of its vast resources to get Ksplice into the hands of sysadmins everywhere.Feel free to direct questions to me at waseem.daher@oracle.com or to jobs@ksplice.com. If you're interested, send us a resume and we'll be in touch. Oracle is an equal opportunity employer.
                      
                  
      I'm updating my resume and sending it to you post-haste.  I'm a little bit in love.Though if you were acquired by Oracle, are you still in start-up mode?
                      
                  
      It's tempting to say "Oh yes, definitely," but that wouldn't be completely honest. The real answer is, of course, much more nuanced than that.It's not the totally unfettered we-do-what-we-want-when-we-want-to Wild West that was Ksplice-the-startup, but it is still a small, tight-knit team with a lot of autonomy, and I think the small-team aspect is a huge component of what makes a startup so fun.Of course, the transition to big-company has its benefits. For example: benefits (see what I did there?), an HR department so that we can hire people internationally, a sizeable budget, and the ability to focus on the things that are core to what we're doing without having to worry about all of the overhead associated with running the company.Not to mention the legitimacy benefits: a few years ago, we had a meeting with BigFinancialCo and they basically told us: "Yes, we love your product and we want to run it, but look, we're BigFinancialCo and we spend a zillion dollars on IT. As much as we want to, we just can't run some product made by people who work out of what appears to be some sort of co-ed MIT nerd frathouse in Cambridge." Which, fair enough -- the house was pretty gross.Now that we're Oracle, it's much more of an, ah, how shall I put this, "no one got fired for buying IBM" situation. (Yes, I see the irony in that statement.) Any technical skepticism is easily dispensed with, because we credibly have the support resources to back up the product.My job in particular is definitely one that has probably changed the most: I no longer do day-to-day sales stuff (the Oracle Linux sales team does it all), and as a result I get to focus a lot more on product management, only tactically dropping in on customer meetings when it makes sense.By contrast, the day-to-day of our engineering team here at Oracle is actually extremely similar to how it was at Ksplice. Which hopefully answers your question :)
                      
                  
      I'd have to see it, I guess.  I've worked at a post-buyout "started-up" company before, and it... taught me a lesson about assuming that being bought was good for a work environment.
                      
                  
      Now I'm curious what jokes have punch lines that are git commands...
                      
                  
      Not exactly a joke per se, but take a look at "Improving your social life with git": 
https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/entry/improving_your_social... :)
                      
                  
      I'm sure there are jokes to be made about people having commitment issues or being too pushy.
                      
                  
      +1, We have over 1,000 boxes here on KSplice and it's been great.
                      
                  
      :) that's what we like to hear
                      
                  
      New York City, Rails, Full timeI work at Kickstarter we are looking for more Rails engineers that want to write mission critical code that enables thousands of people to realize their creative dreams.Features are developed by small groups of engineers, designers, and product managers. Some of the projects weâ€™re working on right now include: tools for Kickstarterâ€™s project creators, payment processing for millions of dollars in pledges every week, and new ways to discover projects through social recommendations and data analysis.We deploy daily for features big and small, and encourage contribution to open source projects. Everyone in product and design commits code, so expect to work closely with people up and down the stack (right now we're 7 engineers with another 5 or 6 committers). We develop in Rails and JavaScript/jQuery, host on AWS, and manage code in git â€” but weâ€™re not dogmatic about it.You can checkout some of the projects we've open sourced on our github organization page here: https://github.com/kickstarterSo if youâ€™re interested in helping us build a platform that is changing how culture gets made, get in touch -- jobs [at] kickstarter.com.

      (OFF-TOPIC) - Why are so many jobs downvoted here? Are people downvoting other listings to make their own listings higher ranked? Are there some controversies surrounding the downvoted companies I'm unaware of? (if so please post a link below the job asking for the poster to give feedback on the issue)
                      
                  
      Currently there are no downvoted jobs, but there are several that have apparently been killed by the dupe detector.
                      
                  
      Ah that makes a lot of sense. I believe a couple were actually downvoted before (they weren't dead) but looks to be fixed.

      Mapquest Vibe - http://mqvibe.mapquest.comDenver, CO - Fulltime.Mapquest is hiring engineers to work on a new product, Mapquest Vibe. Vibe was just released at SxSW and we have a lot of work to do before we can strip the "beta" label off. If Mapquest answers the question "How do I get from A to B", Vibe answers the question "Where do I want to go?" Using Vibe, you can see at a glance where the best businesses are in any neighborhood - our goal is that it will help users feel like a "local" wherever they wind up.You'll have a lot of autonomy in terms of how you implement features as well as input into the product direction itself. Projects I've implemented are a semantic tagging system to help categorize businesses, a dynamic geographic buffer to allow for fuzzy location searching, and I'm currently implementing a new API intended for public consumption. It's a very empowering culture and a great place to work.We're hiring across the board. Front-end folks use backbone.js, jQuery and a few mapping-specific toolkits to do various things. Back-end folks use a mixture of Java (running on Play!) and Groovy talking to a Postgres DB. Right now we're doing mobile development for the iPhone, with an Android app on the horizon. Experience matters less than ability - we'd be just as happy interviewing a grad right out of school as we would be interviewing a grizzled vet with 40 years experience. Skills I would particularly like to see added to the team are knowledge of Hadoop and Lucene, but that's my own personal wish-list.If you're interested, shoot me an e-mail (it's in my profile).

      Western suburbs of Chicago (Naperville area). No H1B, no remote. We are looking for junior to mid-level person with either a Java background looking to move to C# or a C# background. If coming from a C# background, must be open to open source libraries like Spring.NET.It's a small team and you will work with public-facing web applications in the financial field as well as back-office application for internal stuff. Must understand RDBMS fundamentals.I cannot name the company publicly because this is not an endorsed post. But shoot me an email (email is in my profile) if you're interested or have any questions.
                      
                  
      I am not interested in this particular job but why would you want to use Spring.NET? Is it because you are migrating from a Java application using Spring.NET? Are there any other reasons?If you are moving to C#, I would definitely recommend another framework which is more suited to leverage C#/.NET. The reason I am suggesting is that because it is very difficult to hire good C#/.NET developers these days and the problem becomes 10 times harder if you are going to use Spring.NET. I know that it will be a deal breaker for me and my other friends who use C#/.NET.
                      
                  
      When this application was started around 2008 or so we had a number of frameworks to choose from. At the time we chose spring.net. Looking back on it, that was a good choice considering most of our alternatives at the time (and since) have come and gone. Particularly Microsoft technologies that seem to come and go all the time. We're pretty happy that we chose a reliable, stable and well-maintained library such as spring.net.I am curious what alternative you'd recommend, particularly if it's something that is production ready and has a certain future.We're well aware of how hard it is to hire good C# developers. But in my opinion, a good C# developer isn't going to be put off by the choice of Spring.NET.
                      
                  
      I think Spring.NET is too verbose and too big. I would rather use few well tested and idiomatic C# frameworks as an alternative to Spring.NETE.g. IOC - You can use MEF which is part of the framework. OR my personal favorite Ninject.Web Applications - Without a doubt ASP.NET MVC.Aspect Oriented Programming - PostsharpDataAccess - I do not think ORM technology is mature enough to use it for any complicated work. For simpler things, Dapper does the trick.I believe in using best tool for a given problem instead of using one monolithic framework. I especially don't like Spring framework because it needs too much configuration in terms of XML files. I prefer configuration through code approach.Email me if you want to discuss more.

      Amsterdam, The Netherlands. H1B[1]Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, DBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a developer there currently working on search and relocated over there about a year and a half ago, and have been very happy with it.We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it.We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including https://github.com/git-deploy and a few CPAN modules.We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it.You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a couple of times before and have already helped get one person hired, many others have had or are having interviews, and I've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. http://booking.com/jobs also has some good information.1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent.
                      
                  
      Stitch Fix is in San Francisco at 3rd and Market.  Full-time candidates only, local preferred strongly over remote, relocation possible for the right candidate.Stitch Fix is a totally new way to shop -- check out our video (http://bit.ly/GSelpp) for a quick introduction to our service. Here's how we do it: Our clients provide us with details about their size and personal style. Once a month they are offered a Fix: for a $20 styling fee we hand select 5 items using a combination of our proprietary styling algorithm professional stylists and send it to their home. If a customer chooses to buy one or more pieces, the $20 styling fee is a credit toward their purchase. Lots of additional detail is available in our faq (http://bit.ly/JaVIM6).  Our clients love the service and the business is exploding. We have thousands of paying clients, business doubled from November to April, will double again by September, and we will grow faster in 2013. We just raised our Series A from top-tier VC firm to invest in scaling engineering, operations, and merchandising -- which is where you might come in.We are building the team that is going to take us to 10x by the end of next year. We are looking for folks that get super excited about jumping in the deep end, building outstanding products, and delighting clients. In Engineering we're big fans of Continuous Deployment, Specializing Generalists, and people that know the difference between hacking together technology and consistently delivering world-class products. We like people that take their work seriously but aren't serious at work. We believe the best products are delivered when engineers are empowered to solve problems, involved in how the business works and have a clear connection to their customer. The engineering team is currently a data and analytics engineer, a front end engineer/designer, and a generalist engineer. We are in the process of moving from a Linode/Django/jQuery architecture to AWS/Rails/(ember|backbone|similar) and beyond that we have lots of new products to build and will need to incorporate a bunch of new technology to get there.
We are looking for 2 more great generalist engineers, ideally with Rails experience but it's not a requirement.If you're interested please send an email to jobs@stitchfix.com.

      Fluidshopping - Berlin - Fulltime - CTOWe are a Berlin-based startup working on next-generation testing and user experience. At Fluidshopping, we want to make split testing easy for web shop owners.This includes test that change the business rules, not the GUI. For example, you may want to test if sending a $10 voucher to those who buy >$50 will have an effect on chance of repeated buy. Or you want to test the effect of free shipping when they bought >$100. As far as we know, these tests are not easy without tinkering with the current shopping cart software setup. We want to make this as easy as testing the GUI and UX elements (design, copy).We use lean startup methods, and can systematically test hypotheses on any market. Our approach is the â€˜startup of startupsâ€™, that is, iterate fast and discard what doesnâ€™t work, even if the new product looks like a completely new application (and startup!). We have runway for a year. We are two people, and have been funded for only two months. We have offices in Berlin, but we often work from home.We are looking for a technical cofounder (CTO) to disrupt the ecommerce analytics market with us and to receive a forthcoming EXIST schoolarship (2000-2500â‚¬/person/month) for one year. We are two people, one of us is technical, with a PhD in machine learning.Responsibilities:Your responsibilities will be to work on new key features, help us scale, contribute to the product and optimize performance. Youâ€™ll be the CTO in an agile development environment. The job offers lots of challenges because we build a real-time collaborative tool in a large market that is ripe for disruption.As the CTO, you set the technology. Our current MVP is Django. We need to interface with shopping carts, and when the API is not enough, that means some PHP may be unavoidable.
What we like:
- node.js
- Mongo or similar NoSQL db
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- python/django
- Backbone.js
- Familiarity with HTML5 (websockets)Perks:
- Work from home as much as you want
- â€¦ but have a nice office, with terrace and BBQ
- Stock options in two-digit range
- Dog
 - In the center of the Berlin startup ecosystem (we organize events such as demodinner)For more see http://fluidshopping.com/blog/about-fluidshopping/

      San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Almost every technological and medical innovation in the world has its roots in a scientific paper. Science drives much of the worldâ€™s innovation. The faster science moves, the faster the world moves.It's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. We are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate. The stakes are high. If the inefficiencies in science can be removed, we may be able to accelerate science by a factor of 2, leading to a huge impact for humanity.For more on the problem Academia.edu is solving, see the guest post on TechCrunch last Sunday on 'The Future of Science' by Academia.edu's founder, Richard Price http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/Academia.edu has over 1.2 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We need talented engineers to come and help us with the mission. We have a strong engineering culture. We're an 11 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:â˜… tools for scientists to share their work faster and more openlyâ˜… algorithms to mine our data, and to find out what research is trending in real timeâ˜… back-end infrastructure to scale the site on AWSWhat we're looking for are:â˜€ 2+ years of web development experienceâ˜€ Experience with the full engineering stackâ˜€ Passion for engineeringAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture.There is more information here http://academia.edu/hiring.

      I had a conversation with your CEO once that made my stomach sink pretty badly. Your emphasis on academic credentials rather than projects, portfolio, or experience at the time for potential hires really put me off.
                      
                  
      My first thought: isn't Mendeley already the academic (paper-sharing) social network?
