      at least someone is hiring rust developers !!
                      
                  
      But requiring a previous experience is real boomer here... "C++ guys willing to jump to Rust" would've been more appropriate.
                      
                  
      No one will hire a fresher to work in a new language where the system is also new.
                      
                  
      I wouldn't classify "C++ guys willing to jump to Rust" as freshers.I meant, the job posting requires the previous experience in Rust.

      Are you planning on responding to all candidates that apply? I applied quite a while back and never heard anything in the positive or negative even after following up multiple times.
                      
                  
      I received a phone call out of the blue almost two months after applying (about a month ago now). The caller admitted the ad had been posted too early and apologized for the late response. I suspect most of the early applicants, like me, were no longer available.
                      
                  
      Interesting. I'm not sure why they would respond to people via phone instead of email but thanks for noting that they responded to some candidates.
                      
                  
      Built For Me Inc. | Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Remote (US-only) | Senior Software Engineer | Full Time | $150k-$250kWho we are: We are a small company loathe to use the word â€œstartupâ€�. The phrase that most aptly describes us is â€œboutique consulting firmâ€� as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.Technologies:NodeJS / JavaScriptBabel / ES6RDMS: MySQL / PostgresAmazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3GitHubApache Aurora / MesosTerraformDockerWeâ€™re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.https://www.builtforme.techhttps://blog.builtforme.techApply via AngelList: https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/
                      
                  
      I tried to apply via AngelList, and kept getting timeouts trying to submit the multiple pages of forms that need to be filled out in order to apply. You should revisit your Analyzing a Hiring Process blog; 100% of your candidates probably aren't getting to the Resume Review Step. If my experience is at all typical, you're losing a bunch of qualified candidates without even knowing about them.
                      
                  
      Sorry you're seeing problems; maybe AngelList had some issues. I just went through the process and saw no problems, and others appear to have applied successfully. If you keep seeing issues let me know and I can look more closely.

      Hi Nikk, 
We did have a first round conference call interview with you on December 13th 2017.  Apologies if there was some miscommunication as we are only able to do an additional longer second round interview with candidates we're able to move forward with. You are an experienced designer though at the time the relevant team members who would have to collaborate closely with you felt that due to your timezone a different candidate was a better fit, also why we could not do a second round with you as for the design position we could not align your timezone with the team member to conduct round 2 interview for a designer on that particular day. We were happy to refer you on to a few colleagues of ours and they may be in touch if they need a designer with a portfolio such as yours.
                      
                  
      It would have nice if that would have been communicated earlier, but thank you for clarifying. Also, I am primarily a developer, not a designer.

      I'd honestly love to sign up, but the "remote in US" is a big blocker. I don't think I'd move to the US now even if the company was willing to pay for my travel.
                      
                  
      Full agree, especially now that you have to hand over your cell phone and laptop at the airport.It's like "give up your personal privacy to help others keep theirs", a bit ironic, right?
                      
                  
      Amazon Alexa | Seattle, Sunnyvale, Boston | Engineers & Data Scientists | ONSITEAlexa converts natural language into great experiences.  The Machine Learning team that I'm on has lots of great options for people just out of college, mid-career professionals, and some really interesting Principal positions too!Having switched from startups recently, I can tell you that Amazon has a fantastic culture when it comes to product development.  It's a critical thinking company and we do work that really is informed by our users and their feedback.  Everybody is super sharp and the best part really is the team.Email me even if you're not so sure about a big company, I'm happy to help with the process and give unvarnished feedback.Visa/Relocation available and there are options in Germany and the UK as well.
                      
                  
      I get the same anxiety about applying for Amazon as I do Google, having not worked for a
"famous" brand before (except for possibly Myspace Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯) 
and not having a degree (although plenty of experience). Is having a degree essential for Amazon?
                      
                  
      It's not essential; I know plenty of people at Amazon without college degrees.  But you won't make it though the interviews for an Software Development Engineer role without basic computer science knowledge.  So if you didn't take data structures and algorithms in school, learn them on your own.
                      
                  
      Not at all! I'm an engineer at Amazon with no degree. It matters far less where and how you obtained your knowledge than that you have it.

      It's a shame France is one of the countries you are unable to hire in at this point, I would be really interested otherwise.
                      
                  
      that is actually an odd list, which places restrict the ability to hire french or swedish people?
                      
                  
      The general reply is on the linked page: 'Each country has unique rules and regulations affecting a companyâ€™s ability to conduct business in that country, as well as the employability of its citizens. These rules can be complex.'.The rules in France and Sweden around hiring contractors make it impossible for us to hire more people there.
                      
                  
      It's funny how Germany is not in the "unable" list but I still got this answer:"Thank you for your application to join GitLab. Unfortunately at this time we do not have an entity or payroll solution to hire employees in your country and do not have a business need for contractors in this jurisdiction currently."

      I can't speak for life in any of their offices, but just a heads up to anyone thinking of applying here:I interviewed with them, made it several rounds, and then they went radio silent, after giving me the runaround. Given they approached me, this was particularly confusing. They just seemed very disorganized.This was a few months back, so maybe they've change, but it was a complete waste of time.
                      
                  
      I interviewed in Eugene at a game company once many years ago. Was raining the whole time, their building was covered with moss, people were crammed in cubes in the hall, and the president handed me a written programming test. I handed it back and said no thanks and left.

Weâ€™re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as â€˜adventuresâ€™. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.We are backed by one of the UKâ€™s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First. We care about our craft and itâ€™s important to us that you do as well. Weâ€™re looking for someone with a couple of years of coding experience under their belt and whoâ€™s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that youâ€™re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it. Youâ€™ll work on a customer facing React.js website as well as an Android only React Native app. You donâ€™t have to know our whole tech stack but itâ€™s important that youâ€™re willing to learn. Youâ€™ll collaborate closely with the CTO as we turn our proof of concept into an MVP ready for production. Youâ€™ll build new features, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you.We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually puts you in an unstable spot. Our projects are written in Javascript, React.js, React Native and all use ES6. For this role, Javascript skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education. We donâ€™t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what youâ€™re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.We see coding as a way of communication, itâ€™s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English. Our intention is to enable remote working and flexible working hours as soon as we can. As this is one of our first hires, we need you full-time on-site in our offices in central Richmond upon Thames.crew@cargomate.co.uk

      Time waste alert. I was asked to complete a timed take home project. It took a few hours. I waited a few days and when I didn't hear back I sent my own follow up email. I then received a canned rejection email in response.
                      
                  
      Yeah sometimes this happens. I recommend refactoring and removing any infringing code if any and posting it on github as part of your portfolio.

      I'm curious, do you have any suggestions for reading on designing microservices while explicitly dealing with network chattiness? It seems like that can be a major issue.For instance, if you have your microservices setup in the cloud, AWS/Azure/GCP, and have your microservice domains on their own servers network chattiness can easily cause issues with billing and service responsiveness if business logic regularly deals with multiple domains.
