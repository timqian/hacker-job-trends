      Kudos for listing your salary, I've given you an upvote and hope you float to the top and get lots of attention!
                      
                  
      Unlimited vacation :) Can I start now?
                      
                  
      Unlimited vacation comes down to placing the burden of taking time off on the employee. It's mostly there to deter employees from taking time off and to keep a competitive environment. "X left for 30 days last year, Y only 15. Y seems to be more invested in their work."Don't let this fool you, it's more often a trap than it's not.
                      
                  
      You need to ask yourself: Why does the company do this? Why does the company not grant everybody 50 vacation days by default and encourage employees to work more by paying out small bonuses (like $500) for not taking more than 50% of their vacation days?It's because they want the employees to not take any days off. Peer-pressure is insanely strong in those environments. You are supposed to feel bad to letting your colleagues do the work, while you voluntarily (!) take time off. Especially at start-ups there is always something for you to work on.As an employee it's easier to agree on like 25 vacation days/year beforehand because then it's in the contract and both parties can point to it when there are problems. If a colleague has a problem with someone taking more vacations days, it comes down to their own inability to negotiate more days for themselves; not to some "backstabber" leaving their colleague behind for some fun.As I said, there are cases where unlimited vacation days work out but I would say those are the lucky 1%.
                      
                  
      I've seen some employers keep an "unlimited vacation" policy with strongly-suggested (i.e., mandatory?) minimums like 3 weeks a year.  Having minimums would probably help with this trap, although I can't really speak from experience on the matter.
                      
                  
      Your understanding of what unlimited vacation means is not correct.  It means: "more vacation than most jobs, probably" -- let's say about 5-6 weeks with stray days here and there.
                      
                  
      Well, that's what they want you to think it means.  The reality is that it means something quite different.But either way -- just by calling it "unlimited vacation", they're f-ing with you from the very start.
                      
                  
      This is the most comprehensive reply on this post today. Kudos for the transparency!

      Amazon | Software Developer | Seattle | Onsite, Part-time https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/part-time-techDo you want a 4 day work week? Are you looking for a reduced schedule but still want to make a huge impact? Amazon is creating a part-time workforce technology team that will work a 30-hour per week schedule. All team members, including the manager, will be on the same schedule. The Workforce Technology team will be chartered to build high-visibility, enterprise-wide solutions that leverage Alexa Skills voice-interaction to improve Amazon employee productivity. These solutions will be at the forefront of Voice Assistant technology applications for the workplace, in one of the largest and fastest-growing companies on earth. All employees working a reduced 30 hour per week schedule will receive the same benefits as full-time employees.Full job description: https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/409370If you have questions about the position or the team, feel free to email me (hiring manager) at dvarga@amazon.com
                      
                  
      Just want to say it's fantastic to see this and hope you have great success. If I were in the Seattle area I'd definitely consider applying!
                      
                  
      Wow, I've always heard terrible things about Amazon burning their employees into the ground, but this sounds like the opposite. Kudos for trying something different.
                      
                  
      Maybe I'm too cynical, but the first thing that came to mind for me was: "Just few-enough hours that employees have no benefits."
                      
                  
      The magic number for the benefits cut-off is 20 hours/week.
                      
                  
      I'm not sure what you're referring to -- Amazon policy? -- but the usual critical-point is 30 hours, for full-vs-part-time legislation and stuff like the ACA.https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/full-time-employee/
                      
                  
      We meet that definition of full-time employee and everyone on the team gets full benefits.
                      
                  
      Wait until you ask your interviewers about on call rotation.
                      
                  
      It's definitely something we're watching carefully. On-call is still a thing on these teams, but we think there are ways to keep the burden low.
                      
                  
      Thanks! We're excited to pilot this program and make it successful.

      BBC iPlayer | Development Lead | LONDON, UK | Full Time | Â£40-Â£70kWe're looking for a development lead for the iPlayer Business Layer - the team behind the iPlayer API serving the website, mobile clients and devices.
Our tech stack is mostly Node.js with Postgres and Redis databases on AWS in microservices.We're now averaging over 100 million API requests every day, with an average 2,000 req/s and a <7ms response time (that's for the past 7 days from now).
Some exciting projects we're working on include a machine learning one and a big priority for the year ahead is personalisation. Our open source projects currently see 40k downloads/month and we're keen to expand that.It's a small team (2 senior engineers, 2 engineers (<- one of them is me!) and usually a graduate), and we're based in White City.Spec & Application: https://careershub.bbc.co.uk/members/modules/job/detail.php?...
                      
                  
      Just saying 40-70k is pretty low. Is that all the BBC has to spend on it's hiring budget?
                      
                  
      You get a lot of job securities in the UK. That usually results in a lower wage (risk mitigation costs money).
                      
                  
      I'm from the UK, I know this first hand.
                      
                  
      Why does this conversation always comes back ? Yes salaries aren't the same both side of the Atlantic. But the laws and taxes and advantages and etc etc aren't the same either.
                      
                  
      To be fair Facebook come in at 70k in London.
                      
                  
      I've heard that Google pay less in London than they do in any of their US offices.
                      
                  
      70k in London is like 70k in SF. Pretty incredible if you ask me. Must be a cost center.
                      
                  
      That's still pretty high for a London wage though.  While living costs are the same, salaries are about half across the board in London.  Just moved back from there.
                      
                  
      I suspect that the finance industry doesn't have that problem in London. Someone's buying up all the 2mil quid houses (other than oil wealthy investors).
                      
                  
      If the salaries are half, is the recruiting process accordingly easier in London?
                      
                  
      People get by with a lot less. The median household income in London was Â£39k in 2013 [1][1] https://data.london.gov.uk/apps_and_analysis/gla-household-i...
                      
                  
      Dude ... you can "get by" on Â£70K in London. Most people get by on MUCH less. Â£70K would get you a nice rental flat, eating out anytime you like and still saving about Â£20-30K a year. And that's if you're single, if you're sharing expenses you could save more.
                      
                  
      "get by", seriously?The median salary for London is Â£34,473 (2015 data).
                      
                  
      With that salary you could easily save Â£1500 a month
                      
                  
      It's $85k usd. So yes low.
                      
                  
      As I was looking for some remote job in UK, Ireland, and USA, I noticed that the salaries in Europe are generally lower than in the US. No much lower, but there is a noticeable difference between $120k in US, and $80k in Europe for the same position, similar company, and contract in both cases.
                      
                  
      And I'm also assuming that remote positions in Europe aren't going to include any medical insurance.  Which makes those jobs a total no-go for an American.
                      
                  
      For London is not that low at all. And... in the rest of Europe is generally lower.
                      
                  
      This is a lead position. 70k is low.
                      
                  
      True, in Finland it's very good if you get 50k. Most SW engineers work for 25-40k salaries.

https://whoishiring.io/search/36.0440/-90.8984/4?source=hnIf you post here, please use the below format to help me with parsing. If you wonâ€™t, no worries, I will do my best to get all the things right.  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: ONSITE, REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, SALARY, company-url}

Iâ€™m using this regex to test the firstline, you can test it here https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/3  \s*(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s*(?:\|\s*(?P<attrs>.+))?$

NEW THING. There were requests for salary, so since this edition attrs section will handle salary as well. Check bellow for the regex.  SALARY:(?P<salary_min>\d+(?:k|K)?)(?:\s*\-\s*(?P<salary_max>\d+(?:k|K)?)?)?(?:\s?(?P<currency>[A-Z]{3}))?

      It looks like you might be picking up the word "remote" from descriptions instead of the heading and then incorrectly showing those jobs as remote positions. For example,

      Have you fought of setting up a form so people can submit through the form and always have the format right (hard part might be making it post on their behalf).
                      
                  
      Even better would be a tool to generate the text to post on HN, while letting the user post it - low effort, and standardizes things

Collaborating with a team of people who excite, grow, and surprise you every day, whilst crafting a great product is how we think work should be.
Wevolver is mission-driven: prioritizing making a positive impact on people's lives and our society and we strongly believe in our goal of enabling anyone, anywhere to develop hardware technology.
We're a transparent organization, heavily involved in open source.We provide a collaboration platform for hardware development. Our platform is used globally by engineers to collaborate on both open-source and private projects.Wevolver has a strong support network of advisors and recently raised an angel round from investors in Silicon Valley, United Kingdom, and The Netherlands.

â€¢ The Accenture Innovation Award.
â€¢ SXSW 2016 Innovation Award.
â€¢ Fast Company listed Wevolver in the Top Most Innovative Web-platforms among Slack, Facebook and IBM Watson.Our stack is listed above. We are currently on Angular 1 and will either upgrade or move to React (a decision which you can influence)
Salary range: $40K â€“ $120K Â· 2.0% â€“ 7.0% (depending on location & experience)
Job details: https://goo.gl/Zwkh4XLooking forward to hearing from you!
                      
                  
      Can I apply directly without an Angelist account? Like, say, send you an email or give you a call or drop by your office. I'm based in Amsterdam :)
                      
                  
      Yes you can, drop an email to info@wevolver.com
Would love to hear more about your work and why you'd be interested in joining us. Then let's take it from there.
                      
                  
      How does being a transparent organization manifests?
                      
                  
      We are internally transparent about salaries and equity, and use a transparent salary formula to base salary on role, skills, location etc instead of 'negotiation skills.' 
We also share as much as possible of our organization's 'handbook' openly: https://github.com/Wevolver/Handbook
                      
                  
      Transparency is a relative term, and full transparency is an illusion, at best. I suggest companies don't use transparency as a core value because of this assertion.
                      
                  
      True it's relative. I think transparency is an approach. An approach that helps create a healthy workplace and contributes to more productive and happier people.
(Also we have not stated that we are fully transparent. Transparency is hard, but I strongly believe in the approach)

      Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | OnsiteAcademia.edu is addressing two problems:- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisis"With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don't publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

      I graduate this year with a lot of experience with web development. But I've spent a lot of hobby time with Rust and would like to head in the Systems direction. Do you know if London offers junior-ish systems positions?
                      
                  
      I would apply to a position on our site and write a nice cover letter (our recruiters are great and actually read it).If you have hobby projects you have built, mention them proudly and show them off (this is the way I was hired at cloudflare).We don't do much with rust, though. Lots of Go.

      Edit: wrong company. Leaving original below so reply makes sense.Your company contacted me on Indeed Prime and scheduled a phone interview. However no one called at the agreed time and I received no response to attempts to reschedule. So I'm wondering if it would be worth my time to apply here?
                      
                  
      I apologize that happened to you. When did that happen? I will speak with the recruiters about it to ensure it does not happen in the future.If you are still interested let me know.
                      
                  
      My apologies. I have confused Endgame with another company.My actual interaction with Endgame is weirder. In February, I received a rejection letter from Endgame despite never applying or ever authorizing a recruiter to apply for me. I know I didn't apply because the rejection was sent to a school email that I haven't used in years. I also don't know what sort of outdated resume this decision was based on, although I am tempted to apply now with my current resume out of some sort of competitive instinct.I don't blame Endgame as this was probably caused by an unscrupulous recruiter who scrapped my out of date info from my school's website.
                      
                  
      Thanks for updating the comments. That is a really strange interaction.You should apply! If you want a run down before applying let me know and we can setup a time to talk.
                      
                  
      Hello. I am interested in the product management position. Please let me know your email id so that I could send across my resume. Thanks.

      Nava | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC | DevOps/Infrastructure/Systems Engineers, Software/Fullstack Engineers | Designers On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k+ + equity + benefitsWe're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why weâ€™re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteranâ€™s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.Itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.
