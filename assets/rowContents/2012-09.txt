Because people often ask, these threads do work. I got in touch with http://romotive.com after seeing them post in one, and am currently packing up to move to Las Vegas and go work on robots (!) with a great team of kindred spirits, only a few weeks after I first sent them a letter.Good luck to searchers on both sides in finding your own perfect fit.
                      
                  
      I'm somewhat curious as to how much ageism is prevalent in these opportunities.  From what I've seen, a large percentage of the staff/lifestyle pics associated with these companies show an endless sea of smiling employees in their late 20s & early 30s.  Is there room for devs beyond that age?
                      
                  
      How shall I put this - just as A people hire other A people, twenty-somethins hire other twenty-somethigs.One of the things as a guy starting up in his 40s 
I know how much even a brilliant graduate must be taught and trained and mentored.  Whereas a person with 15 or more years under thier belt just needs to be inspiredthis is not to say there are not exceptions, but the younger the founder the younger the median age under him/her tends to be, based at least on personal experience.I am pleased HN has opened up entrepreneurship to people otherwise would have taken the corporate path.  Now let's see if we can push the only glass ceiling that lies behind us
                      
                  
      I haven't feel any of that among the companies I've contacted. I've been pretty selective about whom I've contacted, so there may be some selection bias there. But my choice has always been based on product/position fit, not on employee age. And HN has by far been the best source for things I'm interested in.I'll admit I often consciously choose to wear my XKCD hoodie when I meet people for the first time. Not that I don't wear it a lot anyway, but ...I kind of feel like Steve was sort of an existence proof that age no longer represents the cultural divide it might have at another time.
                      
                  
      I am 25, so there's not much information for you to work with from me getting hired. At my previous startup, I was the youngest (straight out of uni); three other employees had children approaching my age. At Romotive, I look to be just about middle of the pack. A fair number of the people know each other from school, which contributes to a narrow spread.
                      
                  
      I will echo that this thread works.We work with a lot of recruiters and by far the most qualified candidates come from HN. We've hired 25% (i.e. 1 person) of our team so far from HN and I'd expect that number to increase to 50% over time.
                      
                  
      I'll add in another datapoint, I got in touch with Fitocracy due to a who's hiring thread in May and I have spent the last few months of my life working in NYC with an amazing crew and loving it.

      Welcome to VegasTech!
                      
                  
      San Francisco: product generalists and systems generalists.What we do: subscription based social hyperlocal mobile gamified dating discovery engine with loyalty coupons. For the enterprise.Just kidding.We're a stealthy team of technical generalists filling a hole in the universe by building software that enriches the human experience. Everyone on our team codes and contributes on every level, front to back. We've all built web scale products and scaled them to millions of daily active users with zero marketing spend.The world is becoming a different place: everyone is going to be carrying around a network connected super computer with ambient sensors in their pockets. We can see the future that is enabled by these devices. We are making that future happen.Real talk: We've been running our prototype for 3 months now and we all use it multiple times a day, every day. Every person we've showed it to has asked us if they can have it. Every single person who's had it installed has gotten mad when our testflights expire.We are well funded by a long list of top tier investors: http://angel.co/herelabsWe're looking for a select few product generalists (designer hackers with mobile expertise) and systems generalists (systems automation, machine learning, distributed computing) who can come in and contribute at speed on day one, and who are world class at more than one thing.Ideal candidates are brilliant, fearless, and passionate individuals who are uncompromising in their pursuit of building an incredible product that will positively affect the lives of every human being every day.As teammates we value commitment and accountability; honing our craft; building tools to create leverage; and seeking to learn from and understand each other.We are offering founding team equity and competitive salaries. Retina Macbook Pro (or Air) & 30 inch monitor are standard issue. Office space in the heart of the SoMa district in beautiful San Francisco. Willing to relocate. Willing to fly you in for interviews. Willing to tell you our stealthy secrets.We are not your typical San Francisco stealth startup. We are NOT another me-too-social-local-sharing app. We DON'T sell condoms by subscription. We are NOT the place to share photos of your dog taking a leak. There will be NO gamification.Life is short. Build stuff that matters.Email siqi at herelabs.com. Interns and H1Bs welcome.
                      
                  
      You sound very excited about telling us nothing of what it is you do or make.
                      
                  
      That's fair, and we deserve the criticism since we're still kinda stealth, in the sense that we're not publicly talking about what we're doing.In person we've always been happy to give a full demo and share everything we know about our company. We've shown our product to a lot of people and nobody has left disappointed (and many told me they expected to be).
                      
                  
      How can anyone be expected to be excited about your stealthy product then? Why bother posting? Why not just email people who look good on the "Who's looking for work" thread?
                      
                  
      Fair question. We post simply because posting on this thread works.It's worked great for us in the past (and made a hire) and we've been getting great candidates who are excited this time too. :)
                      
                  
      The list of what they are NOT into does imply somewhat that they're doing real engineering.  Unfortunately, these days, that is rare, so that makes them interesting.
                      
                  
      This might be a stupid question, but does the product generalist position require you to code? Or is it more on a product manager role?
                      
                  
      Hi Andy, all of us are contributing code and product generalists need to be able to build what they design.
                      
                  
      Damn, Loved your hilarious video on angel.co. LOL
                      
                  
      The product pitch sounds great. I really hope you deliver on it :)
                      
                  
      Thank you! We're trying our best and having a lot of fun. We will see. :)
                      
                  
      Awesome, can't wait.
                      
                  
      Awesome.

      Two Sigma (SoHo, NYC) - Full Time, Intern, H1BDid you know there's a company based in Soho that has enough technology to be considered among the world's Top 250 supercomputing sites? One that imports over 5TB of data every single day, and has alumni from Google, Intel, and Microsoft?You might think I'm talking about some stealth-mode startup, but I'm talking about where I work: Two Sigma Investments.

      We tend to hire people with at least a bachelorâ€™s degree in a technical or quantitative field and experience with C or languages that target the JVM, but we are open-minded in our search for critical thinkers who are passionate about technology.In that case ("tend to... but") you might want to fix the language in your CL ads, which explicitly contradict what you're saying here as to the strict requirement of bachelor's degrees (which had also better be from an elite school, apparently):"Successful candidates will have, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree in computer science from a top university..."
                      
                  
      Dave's a nice guy, interviewed with two sigma a couple of weeks ago, didn't get an offer but enjoyed the experience.

      Factual is hiring engineers and data lovers of all levels in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai.Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US ('exceptional' meaning you are a great engineer and have lots of machine learning/data extraction/NLP/etc. experience that is relevant to what we do).Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.

      SF - Rails/JS - HALF OR FULL-TIMEI've mentioned before that we have a few engineers who work half-time-ish (and do their own things the rest of the time) and it got some positive feedback: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3850480We're looking to hire a couple more engineers who are interested in being part of a team but would prefer to work 24-40 hours per week instead of the usual 50+. If it sounds interesting let me know (ragalie@verbasoftware.com)=========About us:The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.About 225 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore's offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.We're looking for people familiar with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems on the technical side, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck, and we're always looking for ways to provide more control to our support team so they can provide top-notch customer service.The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.Be sure to check out our website (http://www.verbasoftware.com) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)

      San FranciscoFreedom FreightRails Developer, iOS DeveloperThe last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Freedom Freight is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has.  This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry. We are changing that.If you're ready to change the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to sean@freedomfreightusa.com

J.Crew is expanding rapidly right now both domestically and internationally and we are looking for good devs -- and techies of all kinds actually! -- for our NYC headquarters. (We don't work with recruiters. Sorry, recruiters). My contact info is in my profile if you're interested in finding out more and are in the New York area or are interested in moving here (We don't permit remote work - except with our team in India).Also, please keep in mind that, while you are free to apply for the job listings you can find on our website, if you're good and  have an interest in working for us, at the moment (because of our rapid growth) there is very likely to be another role that can be carved out for you depending on your skills and/or interests. I may be able to help if you fall into the latter category.Some of the perks include 5 weeks of paid time off (to be precise, 25 days of paid time off includes sick days,  personal days and vacation days), half-day summer Fridays (just ending! sob!), free in-house masseuse, Starbucks coffee, balanced gender ratio, clothing discounts that can be as high as 75%, tuition reimbursement, in-house technical training and a really nice office building overlooking Astor Place with views towards lower Manhattan.Regards,Alleyn

Youâ€™ll mostly be working with the Python web app, but will also have to work with the native iOS shell occasionally, too. Youâ€™ll have to work closely with the API, as all new features are be added there first.#Website: Our public-facing website is a simple Node.js app. Youâ€™ll be working closely with the API to mirror certain features from the iOS app to the website.

      Vienna, VirginiaCome work for WordReference.com, the top website for translation dictionaries.  I have a position open that I think would be a great fit for a reader of Hacker News.  It is for a coder with business sense who will be in charge of nearly all technical aspects of running one of the largest websites in the DC area.This position would be great experience for a person interested in someday launching their own online business.  You would work on nearly all technical aspects of running a large website, and work with me in launching new features.  While we need to work closely together, you can work from home much of the time. (I highly prefer somebody who lives in the Washington, DC area.)  Weâ€™ve been around 12 years so we aren't exactly a startup anymore. While there are no stock options, one advantage is that we have sane working hours.Requirements:
 - Ability to code and an interest in creating and running excellent websites.
 - Not religiously opposed to working mostly with C#, JavaScript and MySQL.
 - An interest in or knowledge of foreign languages is a plus.
 - Serious web development experience is a plus.If this sounds like something that you would be interested in, write me through jobs@[our domain name] and I (the founder) will be in touch.

Talk to us.Programming abilities are strongly desired, but not strictly required. You would necessarily need to do some JavaScript and jQuery as needed for the UI development, but good programming fundamentals and the ability to pick up (or already know) things like Java and SQL would be a huge plus.

      EnergySavvy - Seattle, WAU.S. utilities spend $6 billion a year on energy efficiency programs encouraging their customers to use less energy, spurred by regulations or simply to avoid building expensive new power plants. Utilities achieve these energy savings by outsourcing these programs to consulting companies armed with Excel spreadsheets and filing cabinets, meaning that the programs don't always work as effectively as they could, and making it difficult to measure a program's effectiveness in a timely manner.EnergySavvy is the data collection and analysis platform for these energy efficiency programs. Through great software and user experiences, we make programs run better, collect clean and consistent data and let our customers optimize their programs in real-time.We're hiring backend Python devs, front-end devs, PMs, etc. Here's our jobs page:http://www.energysavvy.com/jobs/We're also currently offering a $13,000 referral bonus to anyone who refers a dev/PM that we hire!

      San Francisco, CA. Full time. H1B okay.50% of traffic is now driven by social media, and referrer information is increasingly useless with mobile clients and HTTPS. Traditional web analytics doesn't work for social traffic. So awe.sm is building full-featured social media conversion tracking and analytics.Right now and in the medium term, we're providing immediate value to our customers by giving them firm numbers on the ROI of their social media efforts, in terms of dollars, signups, pageviews or any other metric they pick. Our APIs allow app developers to easily integrate social features into their products and easily present the analyzed data back to their own customers, without having to build their own processing clusters and workflows.
Longer term, we want to know what's important on the Internet, and we believe that instrumenting social behavior is the way to do that.We're looking for back-end engineers who are interested in learning how to handle large volumes of data for aggregation, geo analysis, and graph analysis, in close to real time. We're currently in transition from a mixed stack of PHP and Ruby to JVM languages -- we believe in simple parts loosely coupled, and also in picking the right tool for the job, so you genuinely have the power to shape the stack you work on.We're also looking for front-end developers to continue to build out our GUI, which is a backbone JS app built on top of the same APIs our customers use.http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernewsWe're 13 people right now. We have a cool new office with awesome views ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream ) in the heart of the Mission. We have catered lunches, and full health, vision and dental coverage. We use an IRC server for team communication and are agile in the sense that we move quickly and react fast, not in the sense of having attended an overpriced training course.
                      
                  
      There's no checkbox on your hiring page for "thinks about graph algorithms and graph analysis in Dolores Park on a Saturday" or Perl or R.  I'm interested but I'm not sure I'd land in the right pile checking off the languages you have listed.
                      
                  
      Graph algorithms and graph analysis in Dolores Park on a Saturday?  This job's way too hard for you, man.  You should be thinking about Photoshop instead.  Then you'd have something to check on that form on their hiring page, at least.Besides, face it, coming from an R and Perl background, you'd never be able to grok the nuanced complexities of PHP or Zend.
                      
                  
      The coolest thing (IMHO) about what we're doing is that we've built it as infrastructure for others to plug into their apps. Everything (and more) that can be done through our GUI can be done via our APIs (see http://developers.awe.sm).So in addition to the pure engineering roles mentioned in the parent, we're also looking for someone to help us deliver a kick-ass Developer Experience: http://jobs.awe.sm/apply/iXa9QF/Developer-Experience-Lead.ht...

I'm an engineer in the software team, developing mostly embedded design and instrumentation tools for FPGAs.We are looking for software developers experienced or with a strong desire to learn about Computer Architecture, FPGA design, Digital Logic, Embedded Systems, and more, while at the same time developing engineering design tools in high level languages.To give you an idea of what we do, these are some of the projects that involved me at Altera :  * Designed and implemented a high performance on-chip network that's used
    in thousands of routers, base stations, and switches around the world.
  * Created a hardware/software instrumentation framework in a mix of Java, C++, C, 
    and Verilog. This is the foundation for all the debuggers at Altera.
  * Modified the GCC toolchain to add support for Altera's processors, like our
    NiosII soft processor.
  * Implemented a GDB Server from scratch in Java.
  * Defined and implemented the pieces of an ARM CoreSight debug subsystem.
  * Implemented infrastructure used in a C-to-Gates compiler.
  * Spent hours hacking away with the tools and many of the available
    development boards.

If the above sound interesting to you, then Altera might be the place that you've been looking for. Send me an email to sbrugada at altera.com telling me why you think this would be a good match. You should attach your resume too.
                      
                  
      Notting Hill, London, England.Our web application is at the heart of our busy e-commerce business; every day it serves millions of product images and handles thousands of purchases - but we can and do update the live site with new code anytime we want without missing a beat. Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux, Windows, and Mac workstations in the team.

We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. We expect developers to be generalising specialists, ready at the drop of a hat to refine an algorithm, write a tricky integration test, tune a SQL query, or discuss feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles including front- and back-end devs, sysadmin, and IT admin.Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

      Redwood City, CA - UI EngineerTidemark Systems (http://www.tidemark.net, note ".net") is hiring.Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem. For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound. The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.We've got a bunch of other openings as well (see http://tidemark.net/company/careers)    * Technical Support Engineer
    * Director of People Operations
    * Operations Engineer
    * Graphic Designer - Web Developer Emphasis
    * Sr. Technical Writer
    * Enterprise Account Executive
    * Application Tier Developer
    * Computation Engine Developer

      New York City: Software Architect @ TMP WorldwideTMP Worldwide is looking for a second developer to work on the architecture team, to help design and develop a core platform and back end systems for connecting our expanding suite of recruitment-related software products.I'm not a recruiter, and TMP is not a start up, I am a developer myself in TMP's 5-person architecture team.  The work environment is really great, and I get to work on interesting problems every day.  We are a Microsoft shop, so strong C# and SQL Server experience is preferred.  We are using things like NServiceBus, MVC4, Solr, MongoDB, Backbone.js and lots of other interesting technologies.  This position has a lot of influence in future technology choices, along with plenty of room for creativity and experimentation.If this sounds interesting, shoot me an email at Daniel.Battaglia@tmp.com, or apply using the link below:http://www.jobsattmp.com/new-york-state/web-development/jobi...

      Site is in English, run by a US based startup fund/accelerator, why do you think other countries would post here?
                      
                  
      While run by a US startup is fine but when you say "in English" you are not aware of the other world.
                      
                  
      Wow, that's a willful misinterpretation of his comment. The original comment asked about "other countries" as well. The reply replied to the "other countries" part. Relax.

      Invodo, Looking for Senior Software Engineer
Austin, TX, remote strongly unlikely
(I'm going to copy-paste pieces from the job posting, but if you'd like more information or are just curious about what we're doing, drop me a line at mbrace@invodo.com).What we do:
Invodo helps businesses sell more through the power of video. As a full-service video solution, Invodo creates high-quality video at scale, delivers it through retail-focused technology, and publishes to Facebook, YouTube and retail channel partners to expand the impact. The Invodo video solution increases conversion rates, reduces returns and drives site traffic for clients including Internet 500 retailers and major manufacturers.Invodo is an early-stage company so as a Senior Software Engineer you will play an incredibly important role in the success of both our clients and Invodo.Software Engineers are expected to take ownership of substantial software modules, assist with technical product design, and contribute to the software engineering process at Invodo. The development will be concentrated on our core content management system and analytics platform (my.invodo.com). This customer-facing application software is written in Java/GWT using Hibernate and MySQL backend services.Nearly all of our infrastructure services are written using Scala while the web application is currently written in Groovy (historical artifact at this point).  It's hard to cover everything we do technology-wise in a short post, but we have our own player, make heavy use of CDNs for content distribution, our own analytics system and platform as well as an end-to-end workflow management tool used internally and externally for the video production, management and hosting process (the latter is where we're looking to hire).The entire engineering team is less than 20 people, including operations, professional services and management.  There are currently 9 developers (if I'm counting correctly) and all of the work the engineering department does is recognized throughout the company.Feel free to send your resume/github/project urls to mbrace@invodo.com or ismarc31@gmail.com.

      Cambridge, MA (Kendall Square) (on-site, no remote)Software Engineer/Senior Software Engineer at Cogo Labs (http://www.cogolabs.com/)Cogo Labs is a company that creates companies, kind of like an incubator with a twist: all of our ideas/startups come from within the company. We don't offer investment in outside startups. Thus far we have had two major ($100MM+) acquisitions, and a handful of smaller ones, and we are anticipating more in the near future. Typically, once a startup we are incubating gets off the ground, we hire employees into that startup and assist them with whatever they need to make the company successful. Cogo Labs itself has around 40 full-time employees now in our office in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA.I'm looking for a software engineer or senior software engineer to join my team. You should have a degree in CS or a similar field, and experience developing for the web, as most of our startups are web properties. Specific experience in Ruby, Rails, and/or Python are a plus, but not absolutely necessary. I'm more concerned with finding smart people than finding people with specific skills.I am currently developing new features for a web site that we run that gets >50k unique visitors per day, and you'd be assisting in this effort. I can be more specific if you're invited for an interview.We are big on metrics and analysis -- there are grids of monitors (we call them "NOC walls") all over the office showing up-to-the-minute stats about all of our properties. I can code up a new feature, deploy it, and walk over to one of the NOC walls and literally watch my change affect traffic on the site, or revenue, or profit. It's a really fun place to work. Benefits and perks are great as well (see http://cogolabs.com/careers for more info).If you're interested, shoot me an email (cmatthias at cogolabs.com) with your resume and a brief cover letter (be sure to mention you saw this post on HN). Bonus points for including a link to your github page or other code repository where I can see some code you've written.

      rsync.net is hiring an implementation engineer.We created 1TB and 10TB annual "packages" earlier this year, and one of the benefits that customers receive is a concierge level of implementation support.Basically the customer declares what their environment looks like, and we design a solution that effectively (and efficiently) performs their offsite backup to us.So for instance a customer might arrive with a collection of Windows VMs running on Xen, and this implementation engineer would dialog with the customer and decide whether to populate the account with physical (fedex) delivery, whether to backup the images from the underlying Xen system, or whether to do file level backup from inside the VMs.This individual should have a very broad sysadmin-style technical background, ranging across UNIX, all variants of Windows, and Mac.  In addition, some idea as to how vmware/xen/hyperv environments work, as well as things like exchange/SQL Server/etc. - that is what customers have to back up.This individual should be a "lifer".  If you're pursuing an exciting and lucrative career in the field of Information Technology, don't contact us.  If you're not running your own mail server, jailbreaking your own devices, running your own servers and appliances (FreeNAS, OpenWRT, etc.) at home, you're not going to fit here.OTOH, if you're a "fixer" who can "just make things work" and can juggle a collection of high priority clients, please contact us:  info@rsync.net
