      Are you guys hiring any summer interns?
                      
                  
      Will you have people working in the Bay Area?
                      
                  
      Better yet, how about moving some hardware work to Dallas? :)
                      
                  
      This was worthy of a downvote? Why?
                      
                  
      I'm not the one that downvoted you, but here's why:It's as groan-inducingly absurd as "how about you mail me a full stack of strawberry pancakes flaked with gold, just because I asked nicely?"It adds nothing to the conversation but a silly, burdensome request thinly veiled as a lame joke.
                      
                  
      Fair enough.
                      
                  
      San Francisco, Mountain View - Matasano and iSEC Partners [WILL RELOCATE]There are horrors beyond life's edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while man's evil prying calls them just within our range.Talented tech people seek out jobs with interesting challenges. Different firms, different challenges. Here, a chance to grapple with large-scale payments; there, a purpose-built "big data" storage system; elsewhere, software running on an exotic platform; look hard enough and you may even find custom hardware to tinker with.Consider a greater challenge: the one lurking in the shadows beneath all the other challenges; a maddening, beautiful challenge that awaits all applications, be they YC startups or giant tech companies, the hunt for which leads through the crevices of the payment processing gateways, the arcane backend of the storage system, and the insane, non-euclidian instruction patterns output by embedded compilers. The discovery of the unknown horrible secrets of our universe, the bending of those secrets to your will, and the billing of clients for PDF documentation of those secrets along with their exploitation steps and mitigation advice.Matasano and iSEC together comprise one of the largest pure software security firms in the world. Our clients are the best companies --- and most of the largest of them. Our teams include some of the best researchers in the field.I hire for both firms, our practices interlocked in an unholy embrace. You can read more about our hiring process at http://www.matasano.com/careers. Or, for a more philosophical take, here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7259845. Put simply: we hire for aptitude, we ignore resumes, we respect and appreciate candidates, and we put real effort finding good fits. iA Cthulhu, iA iA, &c &c. Also, unlimited soda.You can find out more by mailing <careers at matasano.com>. A human being who knows what they're talking about will talk to you. And I'd like to think we're fun to talk to!For some of the flavor of what we do, check out https://microcorruption.com/
                      
                  
      As someone who just made it through the Matasano gauntlet, I can't recommend it enough. It was fun and challenging. If you're interested in doing security, get in touch with tptacek. I can't wait to get started myself.
                      
                  
      Weft - http://weft.io - Boston, MA (LOCAL) + San Francisco, CA (LOCAL) + Eastern Europe (REMOTE).   ===========================
   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================

We're a logistics visibility platform (read: Waze for Cargo). Weft tracks shipping containers using low-cost hardware to make sure that shipments get to where they're supposed to be on time and intact, saving billions in lost value due to cargo shrink and disrupted supply chains. We take the info we get from the hardware and figure out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predict whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically reroute/reschedule shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff. We're working on a lot of the things that happen once you have that data, but I can't share much about it here   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================

Web stack -> clojure (immutant) + postgres/cassandra/riak -- we use middleman + enlive (and a bit of hiccup) for templating, meaning that we're pretty flexible about frontend tech.Algorithms -> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)Hardware -> think cell phone on crack (atmel avr xmega, a bunch of sensors, gps, gsm, etc). Working integrated chip in the sub-$5 price point now! Have some pilots running with v1 hw.   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors!Looking for help on mobile, frontend, and data science sides!I should also probably mention that we have a team with a bunch of industry vets!If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!
                      
                  
      How much of a problem is cargo shrink and how often does cargo get lost? And if lost cargo is found, what is usually the reason? Theft?
                      
                  
      Cargo shrink is a 25B/year problem in the US -- way bigger globally (logistics by itself is a 4T industry) -- however, we're more about fixing disruptable supply chains (which is way harder to measure, but also way larger). Cargo shrink can be theft, spoilage, misplacement, or a bunch of other similar reasons. Our hardware helps us track that kind of stuff and our predictive analytics helps us figure out the ramifications of what happens down the line!
                      
                  
      That sounds like some huge operations research problems, I imagine you guys have some serious linear programming expertise.
                      
                  
      :-)
                      
                  
      Interesting. Are you also able to track cargo that is held by customs (which suffer from shrinkage due to poor security)?
                      
                  
      That's one of our use cases!
                      
                  
      Awesome. I actually filled out contact form. =)

      CircleCI (https://circleci.com/jobs) - SF or REMOTE fulltime (in the US)At CircleCI we're building the next generation of developer automation: amazing Continuous Integration and Deployment. We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support. Everyone talks to customers a lot.We're still a small team, so you'll have a large impact on company culture. We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook, and have as flat a structure as we can. We're looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.We're also looking for engineers for Developer Success and Developer Awareness positions. Since we have an incredibly technical product, and selling directly to developers, the dev-awareness positions (think marketing, but much more dev-oriented: dev evangelism, writing interesting blogs, CRO, analytics, etc - think a patio11-style engineer) require significant development experience. Dev-success positions are a good fit for engineers who like working with people and building relationships with customers.Check out our jobs page at https://circleci.com/jobs.
                      
                  
      Dude, you should brag about your approach to private offices, like your designer wrote about:http://blog.circleci.com/silence-is-for-the-weak/It reminds me of Joel Spolsky's articles on their approach to workspaces.http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDeveloper...It's so rare to find a workplace in SF that's not an open office plan that some of the most productive people retreat to remote work just to get shit done in their home office, like Rands did with his Nerd Cave:http://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-nerd-in-a-cave/Talking about the productivity of private offices could be a major attractor, the way Microsoft way back in the day had a big poster for college recruiting that was a photo of a door and the words "you'll get one of these" on it.

      Detroit-based start-up (funded, stable, paying competitive salaries) looking for experienced Magento developers.Chalkfly.com is looking for an amazing, experienced, OO PHP developer with deep Magento experience to join our fast-growing, first-rate development team. As a software developer, you would responsible for end-to-end product development, from architecture, to development, to rollout. You must be comfortable participating in design and code reviews, as well as delivering accurate estimates, providing regular development progress feedback and consistently meeting project deadlines. Our developers are effective at explaining complex ideas and concepts to non-technical team members.This is a full time position that would work out of our downtown Detroit office. Occasional telecommuting (like one day a week) is on the table, but we really need people who can be in the office most of the time.Here's our stats:    Company size: 19

    Current dev team size: 5 (and hiring as fast as we can find good people)

    Stack: LAMP

    Version Control: Git

    Bug Tracking: Github Issues

    Project Management: Basecamp

    Mac or PC: Dealer's choice. We currently have 2 devs on mac and 1 on PC.

    Office style: Open floor plan, collaborative working environment, very casual.

    Dev methodologies: We borrow elements of various frameworks, but in general we work in monthly sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, weekly overview meetings.

    Hours: The dev team likes to have people here by 10am most days.

A word about Detroit: The city gets a lot of bad press. It might not look like an attractive option to people who are considering offers from NY or CA, but I would really encourage people to at least take a look. We're in a building with about 20 other tech start-ups who have all received funding.  There is serious investment happening in the city right now. Two months ago I looked up and Warren Buffet (completely unannounced) was 10 feet away from my desk (he's partnering on several projects in the city). We sit right across from the Detroit Twitter office. We're on the same block as the Detroit Google office. Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, is 100 yards from our office. Ford Field, where the Lions play, is another about 300 yards away. The part of the city we're in is clean and safe with newly built downtown living alternatives. All I'm saying is: give it a look.If you're interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at evan@chalkfly.com.
                      
                  
      +1 for Detroit.I am from the NYC area but I visit my wife's family in Detroit about two times a year and always have a blast.
                      
                  
      +1 for Detroit - it is a great tech hub.
                      
                  
      That seems to be an overstatement. I find myself visiting Detroit every two months or so (my SO is in Macomb working) from the Bay Area and although there's more companies starting, the tech scene is still very small (even when compared to places like Seattle).When I've looked at opportunities at Google or Twitter in Detroit/Birmingham, it's really all sales and account management jobs targeted at folks servicing the auto makers.Don't get me wrong, I like parts of Detroit but I still don't feel safe when driving around the "wrong" parts of town. It's getting better but by no means is it there.
                      
                  
      +1 for Detroit and +1 for Michigan, hope you find what you're looking for!

We use a modern web development stack with PHP, an advanced custom MVC framework (like Rails), Vagrant etc. We provide a very productive and flexible working environment.If you are in Berlin (or plan to move to Berlin soon) and one of our open positions sounds like a good fit, let me know.

      You mention that you're hiring remote, but the positions on your website list a specific location, and the front-end Dev gig isn't listed at all. is this an HN-specific posting?
                      
                  
      At the moment, the position has only been posted to HN, though it should be up on the site and other job boards today.  It just opened up, so I was eager to get it posted in this thread.

      Soon-to-be computer engineer here. If I applied for both software and hardware stuff would I be interviewed by the same people? In that case could I just apply once? Because there are lots of things I'd love to do for you guys.
                      
                  
      Apply to either position and mention that you're also interested in the other. A recruiter told me that's the best way to handle applicants interested in multiple positions.I'm in the Boston office where we only do software, so I'm not sure about the interview process if you also do hardware. I would think it would be different interviewers.
                      
                  
      Thanks, will do! Right now I'm pretty well interested in working in San Francisco, as Boston would be a huge jump I'm not ready for. The hardware stuff looks cool, but I don't know if I have enough experience for that (as usual). I wonder where people even start off with embedded software, since every job listing I've seen for such a thing requires 5+ years.The funny thing is the MSP430 is more of a hobbyist's building tool than something I'd expect someone with 5 years to use. As a college student I've used slightly more powerful platforms, but I'd love to work with that. TI even has a nifty watch platform ,that I've been thinking about buying to toy around with.Anyway, if not for that, there's plenty of mobile stuff I'd love to work on too :D Your company is pretty cool in that regard since you cover both bases, just as I do.Thanks for coming here to talk about fitbit ^^
                      
                  
      I heard you guys were totally overwhelmed with embedded programmers. What do you like to see in an applicant to stand out? :)
                      
                  
      Recruiters are asking me if I know applicants. If you think I might "know" you through your HN reputation, shoot me an email with your yc username. @fitbit.com I'm blewis, not brlewis.
                      
                  
      For the intern page, all I see are full time positions. Should I apply regardless and specify my intent to be an intern?

      Hey everyone, hope your April is off to a killer start!Like in last month's Who is hiring I wanted to share all our numbers for complete transparency. March just came to a close and Buffer stands at 1.4M total users served by a small 21 person team spread across 14 cities and 5 continents. 130,000 of our users are actively using the product each month. We generated $350,000 in March, and we have $580,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I'm sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I'd love for you to be part of the incredible journey we've embarked upon.At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we're seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we'd love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.
Do any of these areas stand out for you? I'd really love to hear from you:    - Reliability Hacker (we're sending 450,000 posts to
      social networks every day, our architecture is still
      not ideal)
    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million
      downloads but currently no full-time developer!)
    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are
      all crying out for an iPad app)
    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%,
      we'd love your help improving it and many other
      metrics)
    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used
      Buffer, we'd love to improve our dashboard interface
      and extensions for them)

Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).    - We're completely open about salary and equity, in
      fact here is a spreadsheet of all individual salaries:
      https://docs.google.com/a/bufferapp.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE&usp=drive_web#gid=1.
      It's most likely you'd fall into a range of
      $85,000-$150,000 and 0.1%-1%.
    - We're a fully distributed remote team, and we come
      together 3 times a year for super fun retreats.
      The last one was in Thailand in December, our next
      is Cape Town in April!
    - We have a big focus on culture, that's the main thing
      we think about when someone joins the team. Here is
      our slide deck of values:

If you'd like you can check out more details about all the areas we need help with at http://jobs.bufferapp.comI'm excited about the chance to work with you. If you have any questions about our culture, product or journey so far, add a reply to this - I'll be checking throughout the day to get back to you :-)- Joel (Founder/CEO)
                      
                  
      I'll be transparent and say: I think it's crazy you expect developers to take a 45 day risk/trial period, in order to work at the company.I'm an experienced dev (3+ years of wholesome experience + a solid work portfolio) and I could even deal with the rather significant pay cut I'd be taking... but a pay cut + risking not having employment, when I'm already settled in a current job?No thanks.But good luck.
                      
                  
      > I'm an experienced dev (3+ years ...This is still "barely out of school, hardly knows what he's doing" stage :)Edit - downvote me all you want, but if you are to show up on the interview and declare that you are in an "experienced dev (with 3+ years)", the interview will conclude quickly. It's not that you have just three years of experience, it's the fact that you think it's a lot. It's not. This makes you cocky and cockiness can be costly, especially in an otherwise coherent team.
                      
                  
      Sure, whatever. Have it....but that still doesn't negate the fact that expecting anyone worth their salt to give up a current level of security for a 45 day gamble with Buffer is a smart hiring strategy.
                      
                  
      Experience is relative. Compared to a 15+ year veteran sure, this guy's but a baby in the crib.But he's still a baby in the crib with recruiters beating down his door left, right, and center, none of whom are expecting him to quit his job for a vague, conditional offer of employment.This isn't about who deserves what, this is about the market conditions. Right now the market conditions are such that even devs with ~3 years of experience are highly sought after, with likely multiple recruiter contacts per day if they are even half decent at advertising their abilities.This isn't about whether or not what Buffer expects is "wrong" (for whatever ephemeral notion of right and wrong), it's about what Buffer can get away with. In the current market they most certainly cannot get away with it.
                      
                  
      Define "half decent at advertising their abilities".  I am going on 12 years hardware and software experience, and aside from shitty spam recruiters I have never had anyone beatig down my door.
                      
                  
      If you don't have a LinkedIn profile, get one.Make sure your summary is well written and keyworded with words that recruiters are looking for (and that apply to you) - Rails, C++, graphics, what have you.Flesh out your past jobs section. Keyword these descriptions too as relevant (technologies used, major popular frameworks, libraries, etc).Basically reverse engineer the recruiter's practices - they're using a search tool, searching for keywords relevant to the position they're fielding. This is not very different from SEO. Increase the likelihood of being in a search result and watch the recruiters pile in.While you're at it, make sure your resume is always up to date and available on your own website (if you don't have a website, get one). Make sure you are high up in Google results for your own name. Keyword your resume the same way you'd do your LinkedIn profile - maybe ~5% of the recruiters that show up end up coming directly via my website through some kind of search.
                      
                  
      Well, that goes much further than I would go in defining "half decent".  To me, that comes off as a real Type A, game the system type approach.  If the market was really as hot as is often claimed, that would not be remotely necessary in order to be noticed.What I think is going on, having observed from outside for many years, is that a certain subset of companies are fighting over the same small subset of engineers (self confident, type A shameless marketeers who happen to already be located in SV, NYC, or Seattle) and complaining that they can't find people because this subset is too small to satisfy them all.I have had a LinkedIn profile for almost as long as LinkedIn has been around.  I have had a website with my own domain name since 1999.  I do not have personal or professional experience in $FLAVOR_OF_THE_WEEK.  Despite all the talk here and elsewhere about how its fundamentals that matter and anyone competent can pick up $LANGUAGE or $FRAMEWORK in the time it takes to become familiar with the codebase, everyone still seems to hire based on the buzzwords.No one ever taught me that I should be treating my resume like an SEO problem.  In fact, I have received so much contradictory advice about how to structure my resume over the years that I am almost ready to throw up my hands in disgust.  Plus, the idea of keyword-loading my resume and LinkedIn profile makes me feel dirty; hell, SEO in general makes me feel dirty.
                      
                  
      You're not using the technologies that are in demand, you're not writing detailed work histories, and you're not putting key words into your resume, please tell me you do not wonder why you're not being head hunted.You belittle developers who are trying to advance themselves, their knowledge and make a good living with your Type A thing.Everything starts off as a flavor of the week, Ruby on Rails was just a flavor of the week type deal and then it became huge. Same with Node now and with other stacks before that.I've done recruiting, and am just finishing up a round for my company and lazy developers who half ass their resumes are frustrating. Trying to search for someone is a pain in the ass and not everyone is a professional developer, some of us are just developers at small companies trying to expand. If more people had well written LinkedIn profiles it would make our lives easier. If not a LinkedIn than you need to find some way to make yourself visible if you want to be headhunted.That's not to say it's a bad thing, you can be a very well paid very comfortable developer without ever being head hunted, but having a well made portfolio will make your life easier certainly.
                      
                  
      First off, I apologize for my tone.  I was tired and cranky last night when I wrote that and should not have posted it.  I did not intend to belittle anyone, though it came out that way.> You're not using the technologies that are in demand, you're not writing detailed work histories, and you're not putting key words into your resume, please tell me you do not wonder why you're not being head hunted.I'm not sure if you are saying this with or without having looked at my information, so I will write the response assuming you have not.I use what my employers require me to use, plus whatever else I can get away with that is appropriate for the task at hand.  I also experiment with new languages in my free time, though I stopped listing those on my resume and LinkedIn profile on the advice that I should only be listing items I was willing to be tested on.  If I find something that is better for a task that needs doing, I use it.  As for my work history, I have a detailed history, but I tried to control the amount of detail in each entry to avoid making it too long.> Everything starts off as a flavor of the week, Ruby on Rails was just a flavor of the week type deal and then it became huge. Same with Node now and with other stacks before that.Absolutely, though most fade away into relative obscurity at some point.  The point I was trying to make there is that I frequently see statements about fundamentals being important and specific technologies not being important because technologies can be learned quickly by a competent developer.  Yet the laundry lists of technology requirements seems to grow monthly.  I'm going to learn new stacks because they are interesting and potentially useful to me, not to pad my resume.Overall, maybe it was a good thing I shoved my foot in my mouth above.  It drove me to think critically about my overall presentation to the outside world.  I usually approach it with too much emotional attachment.
                      
                  
      It's okay I was cranky when I responded, also I meant not everyone is a professional recruiter in my comment.
                      
                  
      > "though I stopped listing those on my resume and LinkedIn profile on the advice that I should only be listing items I was willing to be tested on."I'd recommend listing them, especially if you are interested in jobs that use them. If you are suffering from a deluge of recruiters, by all means, do what you need to do to slow down the flow - but it doesn't seem like that's your problem.Here's the thing - the people who are going to be interviewing you and ascertaining your technical capabilities are not the same ones looking for you on the internet (LinkedIn and beyond). Don't let a non-technical person say no to you (or worse, never see your profile to begin with).Put the keyword up, there's no need to be deceptive about it. "Hi, you look like a good fit at our company because of X" "I've used X in my spare time but never professionally, if that's alright with you let's continue the conversation" - you'd be surprised at how many companies are willing to keep talking. The demand is intense.There's nothing untoward or dishonest happening here. You're listing out the things that you know, you're not lying about anything, you're being entirely upfront - the only extra consideration is writing in such a way that someone searching for you would see you in a search result. Name-drop languages, frameworks, libraries, as appropriate, because those are the primary levers recruiters know to pull when searching.> "I have a detailed history, but I tried to control the amount of detail in each entry to avoid making it too long."I'd suggest expanding. We're way past the days where recruiting happened via a pile of resumes on someone's desk, and a long one would make it straight into the rubbish bin without a glance. By the time human eyes hits your profile page it's already gone through a search filter and likely other recruitment filters - it's okay to be a bit verbose since interest is already there. Especially if this verbosity increases your odds of making it past a search filter.> "I'm going to learn new stacks because they are interesting and potentially useful to me, not to pad my resume."Right, and my suggestion isn't to pad your resume with useless filler. That does nobody any good - recruiters end up looking at profiles that have nothing to do with the jobs they're looking to fill. The idea is to think about the jobs you want (and are qualified for), think about what their recruiters are searching for, and making sure your profile gets hit when they search for said things.The goal isn't to appear in more search results in general, it's to appear in more search results relevant to the jobs you're looking to find.
                      
                  
      Exactly this. Listing things you've done as a hobby that you aren't comfortable saying you can work with is a bonus. It shows you are committed to being a passionate developer, which is of course a very very good thing.
                      
                  
      I wonder this too! I don't know anyone complaining about their doors being beat down by recruiters lol.
                      
                  
      Just because (some) recruiters may be "beating down his door" doesn't mean he's qualified for those jobs.  Recruiters routinely overfit, just to cram as many resumes and profiles into their hiring funnels as possible.  Throw it at the wall, see if it sticks.Being as 90% of them can't tell the wheat from the chaff to save their skins, they have no other choice, really.
                      
                  
      Absolutely true. Especially the bit about recruiters.
                      
                  
      I'd say 3 years at a certain company can gain you loads of experience rather than 8 years at a different one. Context is key here as well.
                      
                  
      Yea, 3 years can be very little. But 3 years of real experience (plus intelligence) and the ability to actually come up with new and relevant solutions to problems probably trumps 15+ years of doing the same year's worth of work over and over again (not that uncommon), 20+ years working on technology that's no longer relevant, 10+ years of only doing what you're told while not being able to think for yourself, or any other number of things.Filter out cockiness/arrogance that gets in the way of productivity/progress, etc: yes. Tell someone who's simply confident in their abilities that they don't know what they are doing because they only have 3 years of experience: no.I understand that the prevalence of the so-called "entitled youth" has everyone ruffled these days, but there's a difference between being arrogant and feeling entitled (I'm sure these people exist, but don't they always), and not accepting the old world BS of bowing your head, taking everyone's shit, doing what you're told, then settling for the scraps that get thrown your way (something you should feel so lucky to have happen). In the case of the latter, that world needs to die, and I'm all about progress and moving past such suffocating, stagnating, backward nonsense.Also, when it comes to programming, after about 5 years everyone evens out (with regards to gains unique/specific to years of experience) and there isn't really much difference. Everything past that is mostly inside knowledge or factual knowledge that you get from happening to work at one company or another (or with some person that happens to know said things). And since the technological landscape (past whatever the latest buzzwords or fads are) changes at least every 5 years, all that specific knowledge loses relevance with time.
                      
                  
      And yet even this lowly peon of an engineer, who appears to be contently employed and presumably has great employment prospects if he wants a new job, is offput by this policy. If anything, that intensifies his point.
                      
                  
      I canâ€™t judge (not being exactly a developer) but I was repeatedly told in the last weeks that anything above five years of experience was not meaningful. Iâ€™m not sure I was too happy about that. More importantly I have worked with people with three years on the job that are juniors, and with people whose three years of experience let them run circles around my stories.My point is: being cocky is always bad. There isnâ€™t any real standards otherwise, butâ€¦ you need to be aware that using absolutes makes you redeemable to a lot of things.
                      
                  
      I agree with you and I think the salaries are quite low. I'm just being honest.
                      
                  
      Yeah really. This is a particular strain of bullshit that I've been hearing about a lot recently. It flows from the hire slow fire fast mantra of "lean startups." It feels and sounds like the cheapening of talent/expertise and people. Frankly I think treating people like reality show contestants even once they're in the door is bottom of the barrel behavior.
                      
                  
      Ding ding ding! We have a winner!I understand the problem for Buffer, but this isn't the solution.I've heard of companies who offer people to consult on weekends for a predetermined total number of hours to accomplish much the same outcome. Annoying, but I'll play ball....but really. I seriously doubt any high-end dev talent is willing to take such risks. And if you think this hiring strategy would be successful in attracting high-end dev talent that really cares about Buffer, well you haven't examined the hiring market lately and are likely high off your own supply.
                      
                  
      I don't know what's worse, the 45 day trial or the "congratulations! You've jumped through 3 fire hoops! Now you have the chance to come spend a full day being interviewed by 10 different people!" stuff.A lot of companies have probation periods though.
                      
                  
      You're on a trial at every single company anyway, they just aren't as up front about it.
                      
                  
      well, I'm just feeling a bit burned after a presentation I sat through the other week on the topic.
                      
                  
      I have to agree. What I think is a big deal here is for developers with families. 45 days is 45 days without health insurance and other important benefits. There is COBRA, but that's two months of paying that bill. For most family plans that's 3 - 4k in expense.That said, it really depends how much they are paying the prospective employee while contracting. If it's enough to make up for that then it might be worth the risk to some people.
                      
                  
      What's that you say? Developers with families and (gasp) kids? You mean developers older than 22, with actual lives and responsibilities outside of work? Inconceivable!I will say this, thoughâ€” I give them credit for being open about what they really want. A lot of companies don't do that.
                      
                  
      Ha. Sometimes feels like that.The transparency make them one of the better companies out there. Though I'm surprised this trial period isn't mentioned in their job listings in some way.
                      
                  
      Isn't the "45 day trial" just a disclosure of a reality that is always the case?  Unless you're going to get an actual contract, which as far as I know is rare for this kind of work, you're always technically on a "trial," even after years at the company.
                      
                  
      where did you find this info?

      I emailed a few months ago. Stock standard response like it was a job application when I actually asked several specific questions.I'm sure you guys are great to work for, but don't promise to read every email if I'm just gonna get a mail merge reply.
                      
                  
      I just sent my resume, it's the fourth time. I remember writing to Buffer on September 2013, December 2013 and January 2014. I got the same reply the three times lol.
                      
                  
      Hey there,Great point on this. We've recently had a meeting discussing this in detail, I think you're absolutely right, it doesn't make people feel great to get a standard response like the one you've received. We've been trying to come up with a better way to personally respond to people, which has proven quite difficult. There were 2,000+ applicants last month and I think we're still trying to figure out the best work-flow to make each response tailored.I wanted to assure though that we've read your email (and we do read each and every email, always), even though we sent a standard response (which I totally agree with isn't a great method). Hope that might help and I hope we can come up with a better solution to respond to you and everyone individually in the future. If anyone has had experience on this, would love your thoughts!
                      
                  
      If I can be honest â€” and maybe thatâ€™s me not being used to American-grade fertilizer, butâ€¦Â That response sounds exactly like the problem. I believe that anything else than:â€œIndeed. We f*cked up. Iâ€™ve e-mailed you with short answers. Detailed coming soon.Anyone with a similar issue, please let us know how we can recognize your e-mail.â€�would be inappropriate. No one not invited cares about a meeting. Starting by â€œGreat point â€¦ absolutely right â€¦ doesnâ€™t make people feel great â€¦ trying to come up with a better wayâ€� and other unnecessary precautions around completely obvious points makes you sound like a politician on SNL. There is no â€˜trying to come up with better waysâ€™ to a personal e-mail: there is starting to do it, realising you donâ€™t have the man-power to do it, confessing that you are late on the task. Itâ€™s either more important than what you are working on or not, but that shouldnâ€™t take ten lines to figure out.I love you -- thatâ€™s why I tell you how you can be a better version of yourself.
                      
                  
      What does it matter if you read my email but didn't give me an actual response?What do you expect me to do with this information?On a solution: if every email was read, they should be categorised to ascertain whether they require a tailored reply (ie they had questions that aren't answered with a stock response).Unless the majority of emails had questions not covered in the response that was sent (I can't imagine they did) you would have a much smaller set of emails to tailor replies.
                      
                  
      Hi Leo,I applied and received a form rejection (which I am actually OK with and totally understand) but when I sent two followup emails I heard no response back. If you really read every email, do you also ignore the questions?I also asked for just a few sentences of feedback. I expect this from the average company, but not from yours. You have strong values, but don't live up to them.
                      
                  
      I'm quite happily self-employed at the moment, but good grief - if I wasn't, this is exactly the kind of thing I'd love to read if I was seeking a new challenge. Kudos for your clearly serious commitment to openness, and even more for not filling the "what we want" section with fluff. People who are happy to say "we'd love to be better at this, could you help us in some way?" are the most fun and rewarding to work with (and I'm lucky that I usually do).Good luck!
                      
                  
      Wow, thanks so much for the kind words. Let me know if I can ever help with anything, and good luck with the self-employed business! :-)
                      
                  
      I'm a college student who is studying finance and computer science right now. Naturally, startups are extremely interesting to me. Your level of transparency helped me better understand fundraising, equity structures, and how to think of financial operations. A refreshing and inspiring post for someone in my shoes - thank you!
                      
                  
      Thanks; tip for next month (to head off some of the questions):  > Please lead with the location of the position and include

      Well Joel, I don't know why Buffer is reposting this stuff every month even though you don't seem to have open headcount. This was response from Sunil from last month:"Iâ€™m sorry to say we couldnâ€™t bring you on board as our next Hacker at this point. I hope you don't take this personally. We were absolutely overwhelmed by the huge volume of people like you who sent in their fantastic experiences and ideas for what they would want to achieve as part of Buffer.At this stage, we were only looking for a few more people, so the choice was extremely difficult to make and we had to turn away a lot of genuinely amazing people."It sounds more like a template that was sent across multiple people.It would appreciate if you only post here if there is genuine opening unless you are just craving for more and more applications(that doesn't make sense).
                      
                  
      Joel, I'm impressed that you documented your idea of company culture in such an early phase. I've learned that agreed ideas about company culture play more important role in a startup than usually given credit to. If the founding team has strong shared understanding of culture, they don't necessarily need to be explicit, but I think it would be beneficial for many startups to write a few key ideas down, to make sure that everybody is on the same page.Question: Did you learn this hard way from your previous companies, or was it suggested by a mentor, or was it obvious to you from the beginning that it is good idea to write them down?
                      
                  
      Just interesting, how many emails do you get per post?I have a feeling that getting any reply from you will be like a winning a lottery (thus, I've never applied so far).
                      
                  
      We've been transparent about how many applications we get, which is quite a lot from what I've heard other founders say when I've mentioned the numbers: http://open.bufferapp.com/hiring-at-buffer-in-february-2024-... (we probably get at least 100 emails from HN if we end up near the top).We're lucky to have a lot of interest and so in some ways I guess it ends up like a lottery. At the same time, we try and share as much as we can around the culture and when it is a good fit. Here's a post about that: http://open.bufferapp.com/how-we-hire/Let me know if you have any questions :-)Edit: To answer your question about getting a reply - we reply to every single email, even though it can be tough and can take a couple of weeks or so for us to get to them all.
                      
                  
      Very happy about how open you are. This is amazing!A couple of questions: 
1) what are "Happiness Heroes" and "Weekend Warriors"? What do they do for your company?2) it seems that Mary is getting screwed, although I don't know how much your equity is worth. Why the disparity between Mary's salary and Adam's? She makes 20% less but only has .045 percent more equity...
                      
                  
      Great questions Ryan!Happiness Heroes are the people who help customers with queries via Email, Twitter and Live Chat. Weekend Warriors are people in the team who help with those same things during the weekend (though it's a full-time 5 days a week role, so 3 other days too). We have 6 full-time members of this Happiness team, it's something we make a very high priority. In the last month we answered 92% of emails within 6 hours, 65% within 1 hour, with a volume of around 10,000 emails.I can definitely see how it seems Mary is getting screwed. Our equity number there is misleading, she has 0.3% (column to the right). Key things to note: Mary lives in Spokane, which has a relatively low cost of living and falls into our "C" bracket in the salary formula. If she moves, her salary will go up by either $6K or $16K depending on where she moves to. Also, Mary chose equity over salary (yay) which is a choice to increase equity by taking $10K less salary. I hope that helps explain things there, let me know if you have any more questions!
                      
                  
      "I can definitely see how it seems Mary is getting screwed."I love how you guys went fully transparent but I lost it at this one lol. I was kinda put off by the "we get hundreds of emails" stuff but I guess I'll go ahead and join in the herd. You guys seem pretty cool.
                      
                  
      This sounds like the place for me! I've been looking for months for a company with a culture like yours.I love that you guys are completely open but would love to know what your engineering interview process is like?I'm awful at interviewing and would love to know how you guys handle it.
                      
                  
      Hi there!  Our engineering interview process is something we're continuously iterating on.  At the moment this is how it looks: 1 technical interview with Sunil (discussion on past experience, code walkthrough and a high level technical question).  2 culture interviews with Carolyn and Leo.  Then a mix bag interview with Joel.  If all goes well, we have a 45 day trial period where we gauge technical and culture fit from both sides.  Hope that helps!
                      
                  
      Is this a 45 day trial period full time with benefits?  Or just being a contractor with no benefits for 45 days?
                      
                  
      Can you talk more about how you grant equity? Do you have vesting schedule for new hires?
Also, how does the $10k salary cut for more equity work? do you grant extra equity for every year they take the cut e.g. 0.25% for every year they do it?
                      
                  
      I sent an email to the link you provided last month as well as a separate one to your lead iOS dev and didn't even get a canned response. What gives?
                      
                  
      This the craziest job posting I think I've ever seen in any of these threads. The salary link? Insane.
                      
                  
      Let me know if you have any questions about that or anything else :-)
                      
                  
      Mother of god I'm an Android/iOS/BB developer and I make 45k  a year with 0 benefits whatsoever. I put in my two weeks notice two weeks ago!I would cry if I was paid this much.
                      
                  
      The average salary for developers is roughly in 80-100k. As a recent grad, almost all of my peers were in the 60-125k range. The only salary I've seen that was grossly under the average was 48k- but that was expected.. the employer was TXDOT.Edit: Please assess your contributions and value yourself at market value. Having a conversation with your manager about your market value should yield a higher salary that is competitive. If not, move along. As a mobile developer, you could be contracting for much more than 45k.
                      
                  
      It depends heavily on where you live.
                      
                  
      He said I'm "lucky to make this much" because I have no education, despite nobody else on the team being able to successfully and efficiently replace me. I'm leaving in one month, only because the project is wrapping up at that time and it would be pointless to quit earlier. I can't wait.
                      
                  
      Congrats, and best wishes.
                      
                  
      Surprised you would only make that little - I started as a frontend developer at a non-profit for $51k, which is also under the market (and a non-profit to boot).Depending on where you live, you could easily fetch $20k more, if not even more than that.

      Hey
Last month I sent a mail to ioshacker@bufferapp.com, didn't get any reply. Should I apply again?

      Speaking of positions to be added, I have to wonder how many startups get around the issue of information security. Most of the security-related jobs I see here are either for security-related companies (Palo Alto Labs) or for well-established "startups". Very rarely do I see a startup with a SecOps or security engineer.How do companies get around having (what I consider to be) a necessary employee for a company of almost any size, especially when you're building your own networks and housing your own infrastructure?
                      
                  
      Hey Vishal, that's amazing to hear! Data scientist is a role we've been pondering, if you are up for it, we'd still love to hear from you :-)
                      
                  
      Hey Joel! Quick question; are your engineering guys office based or do they work remotely? I've been following you guys for a while but I'm pretty firmly rooted in Warwickshire!
                      
                  
      We're fully distributed, that includes all engineers too :-) Colin is based in Cambridge. Firmly rooted in Warwickshire is no problem! I went to Warwick University by the way :-)
                      
                  
      That's great to know! Once my current project is over, I think I'll drop you/Sunil my resume.Hah, I thought the mention of Warwickshire would catch your eye. Would be great to join a homegrown tech company.All the best.
                      
                  
      What are some of the tools that you use to support this async culture in different time zones?Do you require people to work specific hours?

      Pathgather - New York, NYWe're a Techstars NYC startup with a simple mission: to make the world's knowledge universally transparent and accessible.

We also have a strong focus on product and design (take a look at our product, and we think you'll agree). Traditionally, enterprise software has lacked in these areas, but we aim to disrupt that tradition.If you're at all interested or curious in exploring an opportunity with us, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at jamie@pathgather.com. We guarantee an amazing opportunity awaits: we'll offer significant salary and equity, the chance to work on real problems experienced by a wide audience, opportunities for open source work and contributions, and influence in our product, culture, and vision from day one!

      Close - We're a tiny startup hiring in San Francisco.We're analyzing professional networks to help folks make the most of who they know. If you've ever tried to answer the question "Who do I know that's..." (looking for engineers, investing in my kind of company, interested in partnerships, able to get me featured on Google Play, etc) -- that's what we're about.It's a huge, nutty data problem -- our professional networks aren't perfectly manicured, exemplary LinkedIn accounts, but disparate and scattered across multiple platforms. Plus there's the task of really trying to understand who everyone is, and figuring out a product perspective that avoids spam and creepiness while genuinely building relationships and value for both sides.We recently closed a seed round and we're looking for a Python data engineer and a Rails developer. If you're interested in a rolling up your sleeves at a really early-stage startup (with funding!), we'd love to hear from you.On the data side, ideally you have some experience with using Python for data analysis, scaling data tools, API integrations, machine learning/natural language processing, and ontologies. For Rails, we're looking for an experienced engineer who can own our Rails stack and lead integrations with our data backend.If you'd like to learn more, please get in touch. I'm jennie at close.co, and I'm the data engineer you'd be working directly with in either role. :)

      Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michiganhttp://www.mutuallyhuman.com/---------------------------------------We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better through software. We're currently looking for full-time software developers and designers.A little bit about us:  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.
    Recently, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),
    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool tools and machines.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a â€œWorld Classâ€� bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - If youâ€™re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youâ€™ve used a lot of technologies, but youâ€™re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, get in touch with me:ej@mutuallyhuman.com
