I wrote a way to search these recently ... just paste this in your console: https://gist.github.com/kristopolous/19260ae54967c2219da8There is both OR and AND support here. If you specify your function parameter as an ARRAY then it operates as an AND, otherwise each argument is an OR.For instance, to see posts that are remote and python OR remote and ruby, you can doquery(['remote','python'],['remote','ruby']);The return of the function shows how many jobs were shown versus in total. For instance, as of this writing, I get the following result when running the above function:{ shown: 56, total: 827 }btw, i still can't find a job. :-(
                      
                  
      Just emailed you (using the address from your paypal donate link)
                      
                  
      thanks ... just got back to you.
                      
                  
      Great for job seekers and employers! I'm using this in the 'who wants to be hired' thread. Hopefully that will be a recurring post.
                      
                  
      Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /c++/: Nothing to repeat...on query(['remote','c++'])
                      
                  
      I love how I'm doing support on this!query(['remote',/c\+\+/])The lack of quotes in the above example is 100% intentional ... copy and paste that exactly ... (js is kinda weird sometimes).If you are really interested (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe...) will tell you more about it.
                      
                  
      just realized you can do a salary search with some regexse.g., query('1..k') works.

      IBM Watson http://www.IBM.com/WatsonDeveloperCloud @ 51 Astor Place New York NY 10003
# IBM Watson Developer Evangelist [REMOTE]I'm looking for a hacker and technical evangelist to join the IBM Watson Developer Cloud team. This position is part of the organization making IBM Watson technology available as REST APIs to developers. Examples and demos of the services here -> http://www.ibm.com/watsondevelopercloud.This is a customer facing role. Presenting to and working with developers in startups, partners and enterprise clients is the main activity, including attending and running public/private/university hackathons. The overall goal is being a general advocate for machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as educating potential users. Preference is for an NYC candidate, with connections to the local startup/tech community.If you have a programming background, like spending time building/hacking and would like to work with IBM Watson offerings and the experimental technology from IBM Research's Cognitive Labs then apply here: https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/faces/job_summary?job_id=WAT-...
                      
                  
      Can't Watson evangelize itself?
                      
                  
      it is too smart for that.
                      
                  
      The last link still leads to a Developer Evangelist role. Are there roles for SWE in in this lab?
                      
                  
      Some of our best evangelists have had previous experience as engineers so if this sounds interesting please apply. However there are plenty of entry level and experienced engineering, other development and delivery roles here: https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/faces/search_results?internal...
                      
                  
      Do you guys offer relocation or visa help for these roles? I've applied to a few IBM and Watson roles but never get a response and I'm not sure if it's because of that.

      Is it REMOTE only for inside the US, or anywhere in the world? Also, do remote workers need to (legally) be able to work in the US?
                      
                  
      Great question! Remote is only inside the US, and you must be able to legally work in the US. These are restrictions we must deal with as part of the federal government.
                      
                  
      USAID and DOD's DIA usually have cool IT/dev gigs.The other thing is to become a military supplier for development, either like Booz Allen Hamilton contractor or independent shop can work.  I worked on a couple of Rails apps for socom/specops.  The money is grreat if you need consulting/ish work.Working with NSA/CIA can become morally ambiguous.
                      
                  
      What's the best way to find these jobs? A quick scan over their websites did not reveal much.
                      
                  
      is 18F hiring junior level engineers?
                      
                  
      We're mostly focused on people who can dive in and start delivering, and helping agencies deliver, better. We help each other improve, but it depends on what you mean when you describe yourself as "junior."But it's worth a shot!

      Do your remote positions still require travel to New York every two months?  That's what a recruiter told me about six months ago.
                      
                  
      Hey Brobinson,Thanks for the question! I'm Zach, Director of support. It really depends on which role you're looking at. Here's how support does onboarding and employee visits.Once hired, our newest team members come to NYC (HQ) for two weeks of training. This is really an immersion program designed to provide you with a strong connection to the company and provide team-specific training. We do a good mix of classroom learning, hands-on, a hackathon project, and interacting with different employees throughout the company.Following the two weeks of training you head back to your home office to start work. We do work in three shifts to cover 24/7, so it's a consistent schedule and team that you're working with. We have managers across all three shifts who help with your development, and we do things like virtual standups to start each shift via Google Hangouts.In regards to employee visits to NYC following training, here's what we do. We recommend a visit every six months or so for 1-2 weeks. It's really up to the individual employee though. Some have visited more frequently and have joined us for the company ski trip last winter or for our first ever shark week (all employees in NYC!!).Again, I can only speak to the support experience, other teams have different operating procedures. It's not a bad idea to check back in as lots changes at a startup. Feel free to re-apply or email me directly, zach@ and I'll get you in touch with the right recruiter who can definitely address your specific questions.Thanks,
ZachPs. We just took some co-working space in Seattle and Toronto for employees to work from :)

      JPMorgan Athena | NYC and London | Full Time | ONSITEI expect youâ€™ve heard of JPMorgan at some point, but probably arenâ€™t familiar with Athena. Weâ€™re the bankâ€™s in-house platform for cross-asset pricing, risk management, trade management, e-trading, etc.. Thereâ€™s a core division (cleverly named â€œAthena Coreâ€�) of about 150 engineers which builds a platform and development libraries that are then used by over 5,000 developers throughout the bank.The Core Analytics team currently has 8 members and is responsible for extending Athena to research teams and for reducing the gap between research and production use. To give a simplified example, our typical customer is a quant who might be attempting to create a new pricing model. Core Analytics would help him access relevant data sets, explore that data with a library of common statistical functions to, verify the new model with a back-testing framework, and then finally publish the model to production.Python and C++ are the primary languages, but weâ€™re open to considering exceptional developers with any background. Finance experience is certainly not required. Our two main offices are in NYC and London; we also have satellites in Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Singapore.Email Christine.h.ko@jpmchase.com to apply.

      Hugely interesting concept but still with a bit of rough edges. I do see the value but I think by using a graph visualization, it's still a bit too complexed.Curious to know if you guys have already had customers who've mentioned that they are interested in paying. I can imagine that there are still a few steps to go before actually getting to the point of lead generation (i.e. strength of partnerships, contact information, etc.)
                      
                  
      Thanks for your interest. We have customers paying, and the graph visualization is just one part of what we offer. The main thing we provide are lists of leads.As to getting to leads... tens of thousands of companies and partnerships in any market segment add up to pretty good recommendations. Most of network analysis uses unweighted edges, so there are lots of methods to use. Having weights for partnerships would be cool but isn't necessary. They can be inferred.
                      
                  
      Thanks. Would love to have a chat more about the role.

(ivan -at- graphiq.com)About the team: The challenge of scaling human organizations is not unlike the task of scaling a technology stack. Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can't be dependent on hierarchy. Developers, designers, and data analysts can form small, cross-functional, mission-oriented teams that are able to operate decoupled of one another (Bezo's 2PT). Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.https://www.graphiq.com/careers/explore-opportunities

      ASAPP - asapp.com/adventure - NYC ONSITEReinventing human computer interaction, starting with customer service.What do the best software engineers, PhD's in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and industry designers have to do with customer service? Everything.Our short-term mission is simple: Make customer service awesome for consumers, and cheap for companies.How? We have found a hidden opportunity. It allows us to reinvent a tool used by every American today, save big American companies hundreds of millions of dollars per company per year, and (most importantly) lay the foundation for revolutionizing all of human-computer interaction in the long term.Our short term plan lays out concrete steps for radically improving large companies' customer service in the immediate future. This plan stands to create a viable and huge business by itself. However, that was never sufficient to truly intrigue us. We are tackling this problem today because it gives us the three things required for our long term vision of seamless human-machine interaction everywhere: Immense amounts of labeled interaction data (e.g text conversations, voice recordings, etc), world-class NLP expertise, and revenue to fund it all.More details: https://asapp.com/adventure

We also have openings for Ux Designer and Ux Strategist positions, along with Project Managers. I come from the engineering side, so I will describe that better:Willowtree is a small but fast growing company that works with the world biggest brands to build them the best possible mobile experience. I've been here 3 years and came from a stereotypical large inflexible software shop in a big city. In contrast Willowtree is strange and unusual in the best possible way:1) Organized into small, fast teams, with extremely disciplined software development process. This is the place develop and perfect your ideal work process.2) Located outside overcrowded metro areas (my commute to work is 10min!)3) Has a crazy amount of trust in each employee so you get to own and drive the product you are working on, even visit clients and tell them how your work can solve all their problems :-)4) Large variety of projects and cutting edge technology to explore or research (I shipped 9+ major apps I'm very proud of in past 3 years or so).5) Contagious enthusiasm. This is what you get where everyone is on top of their game and doing their best work. If there are problems, they get quickly identified and fixed without too much ceremony.If this is the type of place you'd enjoy working at take a closer look at http://willowtreeapps.com

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile -- in practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles. If you want to work in product instead of consulting, we also have dozens of teams working on Cloud Foundry, Big Data Suite, Spring and I probably forgot some cool stuff. Or you can rotate: I had a 7-month secondment to Cloud Foundry which was awesome.Our NYC office is growing fast to meet exploding demand for Labs, Cloud Foundry and Big Data Suite.We are also hiring in all our offices, including new offices: SF, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Berlin, Tokyo and Sydney.We provide visa and relocation assistance.

Ping pong is not mandatory, but it's popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that's life in paradise.Frankly this is the best job I've ever had -- I've learnt more here than anywhere else. Everyone is smart and fun to work with.We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn't matter wether your resumÃ© says PHP or PhD: if you're smart, know some stuff and have empathy, I and my peers want to work with you.You can apply through our website: http://pivotal.io/careers, but if you email me -- jchester@pivotal.io -- I can take advantage of our generous referral program and answer any private questions you might have.

Why not consider a career change?NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team.

Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers/architects and your findings/ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer. All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time. Not too shabby!If you want to learn more about us check out our:Blog - https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/blog/

Our software stands valiantly between scammers and grandma's money.
I found out about this big-hearted YC company from the June 1st Who's Hiring thread and started working full-time on June 15th. Here are some things I've done since then:
- Learned a ton about how payment processing works under the hood
- Used Twilio to add functionality to our phone system so our CS friends have a lower call volume
- Gotten coffee/lunch with pretty much everyone on the team (we're still small)
- Increased gif / screencap usage in PRs & code reviews
- Automated transaction auditing, saving lots of person-hours && increased test coverage
- Helped translate fast-speaking Spanish on a few CS calls
- Observed how a nimble startup implements Grown-Up-Business-Level security
- Finally actually learned what ruby's #inject method is all about
- Had a real reason to consult POODR
We're looking for nice people who have worked on hairy, wacky production full-stack code before - someone who can make things better without being rude, judgemental or arrogant about it. We'd prefer session musicians over rockstars.

We practice code reviews, pair programming and continuous delivery.We are currently looking for full-stack software engineers; as well as people with strong frontend experience.
