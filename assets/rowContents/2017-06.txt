      > 20-hour work weekWowza, that's amazing. I'd love to grab a coffee sometime and pick your brain on how it's working and any pitfalls you've found - I'd love to be able to implement something like that in my next startup.
                      
                  
      Sure, if you're in Seattle I'd be happy to meet up. We also get to the bay area fairly frequently.
                      
                  
      I'd love to take you up on this offer as well... sdm350 at gmail
                      
                  
      Yep, I live in Ballard and work downtown - adrian at adrianpike.com!
                      
                  
      Below it says 20h of remote work, so that might just be that.
                      
                  
      20 hours of remote work, but that's all the work we expect. The job is 100% remote.We really believe that the 40 hour work-week is antiquated when it comes to the tech space and that having people sitting in a chair 9-5 doesn't do anything to help us be more productive.
                      
                  
      Totally agree with this. I always did 40 hour work-week, but  recently had a child and reduced to 20 to manage his first months. I produce almost the same, but now my rss feed and youtube queue is full. Just lost my time doing nothing.
                      
                  
      That is awesome!
                      
                  
      Technically it says 20 hours of billable work. I'm no consultant, but sometimes 20 hours of billable work is much more than 20.
                      
                  
      Oh yeah... Noah's old blog post mentions billable time, but our stance has since evolved that a work week is just 20 hours, billable or not.  If we're doing internal work for the company, we still track and time it to make sure we aren't going over our limit.
                      
                  
      Hello,I've seen this posting at "We Work Remotely" and was curious if I could get in touch and ask some questions? I'm eager to learn more about the opportunity!I live in Seattle so meeting could be fairly easy - thanks!-Nikko

      Awesome, thanks!
                      
                  
      anybody i should email personally? you guys sound really chill and maybe i can help you in some of your HR(diversity) goals you mention on your site. Peace!

      Love the 20h work week!
                      
                  
      This sounds way cool! Is there a physical HQ to work from in Seattle, or do Seattle employees all work from home/find their own workspaces?
                      
                  
      There's a physical office in Seattle.  It's small but there should be room for at least one more ;)Of course you can also work remotely whenever you want, even if you live in Seattle.
                      
                  
      Did a bit of research. You're in Toronto! What are the timelines? Maybe I could get a coffee with you to chat about the position?
                      
                  
      Sure, email me: niall@apsis.io
                      
                  
      cool model! is the salary half of a normal job or less than that?
                      
                  
      I can't tell if this is sarcastic?We consider this a full-time job, and our benefits and salary are that of a full-time job.  We don't try to compete with e.g. Amazon or Facebook on salary but we are probably at or above the median salary of software developers as a whole.I personally make about 2/3 of the salary from my previous job.

      Echoing the negative comments about this company. They interviewed me (two names ago, I believe it was Game Closure) via an engineering quiz. It took two hours and in the phone conversation that followed, it was clear they barely read my (completely working) solution, and then rejected my candidacy for vague reasons around the tech stack I used.
                      
                  
      Also had a negative experience.  I had read some of the comments here, but gave them the benefit of the doubt.  I thought perhaps some of the commenters were just bad candidates, or there was a one-off fluke that gave them a bad experience during the interview process.  Unfortunately it seems there is something up with these guys.  I'm not sure what, things sound good on the surface, but honestly I wouldn't waste your time.
                      
                  
      This exact same blurb was posted last month, but when I spoke to them, they claimed that the "REMOTE" tag was "accidental". This is not a remote position, not sure why they keep adding that tag to their hiring posts.
                      
                  
      I see I'm not the only one who's had a bad experience with these shapeshifters. No wonder they have to keep changing their name. Blackstorm aka Weeby aka Game Closure. They wasted my time. They do NOT want to hire for remote, and will try to talk you out of it. They are NOT offering the salaries they claim.
                      
                  
      They're also "js.io": https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14240175Nothing adds up.I've never heard of their products before. And they've been around for a heck of a long time in these boards with these salaries, and there was no SEC Form D's back then.Also, check this out: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blackstorm-labsThey claim to have 33.5M funding. It's been 9 months, I can't find the SEC filing.There is "news" about Game Closure raising 12.5 Million, but I can't find an SEC filing.Weeby, can't find a anything.> I can see how youâ€™d be bummed spending the time without the expected outcome...I think a lot of "honest people" have contacted these guys on these threads over the past year.They mention on their website (http://www.weeby.co/jobs.html)> Hand-optimized assembly drawing routines for arm6/7
> Create a particle engine which maps to webgl shaders, pure Javascript, or optimized C
> Rebuild backwards compatible Android APIs
> Context-aware code parser for automatic internationalization & localization code parser
> Analytics platform, terabytes of data every week, real-time processing.
> Scale real-time notifications and chat to hundreds of millions of game players
> Create a particle engine which maps to webgl shaders, pure Javascript, or optimized CMeanwhile, look at their weeby's GitHub: https://github.com/weebygamesTerabytes of data from what? Hundreds of Millions of users?Look at their games: http://www.weeby.co/games.html. Some of them were also taken off the store. Others have less than 100 ratings total."The item you've requested is not currently available in the U.S. store."And let's see game closure: https://github.com/gameclosure, here, they actually have something that's not a fork: https://github.com/gameclosure/native-androidIt appears they were outsourcing. In addition, they were hiring programmers in Vietnam: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tappy-pte--ltd-#/ent... https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12407125But what about js.io?> js.io is a new IDE for HTML5 Apps / Games, AR, VR, Minecraft mods, Arduino, IoT, and more, targeting javascript as a common language. We provide developers their own persistent container, a beautiful end-to-end development experiences, r remote-over-LTE (sic) debugging, one click publishing, and carefully polished community support.  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12204213So... where's the IDE for Minecraft mods, Arduino, IoT... it seems to be an IDE that does everything! Through javascript, remember: "Cross-compiling javascript to other languages and vice versa". OK? Where is it? https://github.com/blackstormlabs? https://github.com/weebygames? I see forked repos of Flask and React. How is that going to get you transpiling for Minecraft mods, arduino and IoT? Let alone the abstraction to the API's.Take a look at the "js.io": https://github.com/gameclosure/js.io. It even links to js.io in the description.> js.io is a multi-platform package management and module system for JavaScript. js.io modules can be evaluated in a JavaScript runtime (e.g. node.js) or precompiled into a single package for use on the client side.Here's the game "dev kit" (the real js.io?) they were touting so highly? https://github.com/gameclosure/devkitIt hasn't been updated in over a year, but it does have 600+ stars. No sign of the millions of players, no hand-optimized asm drawing routines, context-aware code parsers or terabyte analytic platforms.Nothing adds up.I look forward to an explanation of where these SEC filings for Game Closure, Weeby and Blackstorm are at. Also, where are the "terabytes of data every week, real-time processing" analytics. The "hundreds of millions of game players". Where are the hard core "Hand-optimized assembly drawing routines".
                      
                  
      I'm disappointed they haven't even tried to respond to any of this, and the poster appears to be "Tom" who's apparently the CoFounder.https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-fairfield-b950a53b/
                      
                  
      You know, people can see when you fib about salaries.According to Glassdoor, this employer's salary to an engineer is 97-104k.According to the Department of Labor, you are paying an engineer 102k/yr (https://lcr-pjr.doleta.gov/index.cfm?event=ehLCJRExternal.ds...) It says Mountain View. Begin date 09/01/2017.Could you explain the discrepancy or please correct your salary information so people don't waste their time interviewing when it's not your intention to fit the salary you specified?Not trying to cause a scene, but interviewed for a few places with high salaries and after sincerely following their interview process, realized they were just giving a widely inflated salary to get resumes in.It may be a "junior" engineer. But still, you're posting 140k as a minimum range in the post currently when glassdoor says 97k and DoL says 102k.Maybe I'm mistaken. Not making accusations, just want to give you a chance to clarify things.
                      
                  
      I interviewed with them and received an offer in the past.They changed their name from Weeby (weeby.co) to Blackstorm.They claimed the same salary range and said they would "meet" my requirements. They ended up offering 120k which was far below my requirement and wasted a lot of my time and energy with them.I'd stay away from them. When I asked them about the low ball offer, they claimed I could earn "raises" every month, all the way up to 220k.I commented about them before on another "Who's Hiring" thread but it appears their comment has disappeared. How interesting...

      Nava | Infrastructure Engineers, Fullstack Software Engineers, Designers | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC | On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k+ + equity + benefitsWe're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.It turns out thereâ€™s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why weâ€™re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteranâ€™s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.Itâ€™s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. Weâ€™ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.

      More like real food for dogs. Should you run low on Soylent you can indulge yourself. Tastes a bit like meatloaf. It's made from human-grade ingredients so it's safe to nab some from your dog as long as she doesn't notice.

      1aim | Berlin, Germany | Onsite, Full Time, Visa https://1aim.comAt 1aim, we develop and produce access control systems, which allow to open doors with mobile phones. We create all hardware, software and IT-Infrastructure to run our systems on our own. Beside access systems we are already putting a lot of R&D effort in creating further new smart home/building automation products. We see ourselves as an engineering-driven technology company, that influences how a future with connected devices will look.We enable engineers to focus on what they can to best, letting them work on new products in small, highly interdisciplinary teams. We try to get rid of as much management overhead as possible (no daily standup meetings!).Right now, we are hiring new engineers for the following areas:- RUST Backend Developer (our backend is 100% rust!)- (Frontend) Web Developer- Electrical EngineerWe do not care about your academic degrees or where you are from, but about the stuff you did and what you could create in the future given the right opportunities. If you are interested in working at 1aim, write us an email at work.hn<?>1aim.com and tell us about the projects you worked on that you are the most proud of and which technological feats of the past inspire you. We provide visa assistance, relocation support and free housing until you find your own place to live.Interview process: 1st phone interview (screening) -> 2nd phone interview (technical) -> home assignment/technical challenge (depending on application) -> 3rd interview (mixed, via phone or onsite)
                      
                  
      I spent too much time in your hiring process: I did the screening, the home assignment and the technical interview with the co-founder (Yann, which is the poster I think). But you didn't took the time (1 min) to give me an  answer or to follow back after the technical interview! You said we'll get back to you in 3 days, but now it's more than 1 month.Beware before applying! Other users in HN reported the same thing in previous who is hiring threads
                      
                  
      That's why I skip companies asking for an unpaid take home assignment altogether. I have a job, responsibilities at my current job, it simply isn't worth my time.
                      
                  
      I dig that you use so much Rust, but I have an OT question: I've noticed on pictures of your locks that there doesn't seem to be a way to mechanically unlock it, say if there's an electrical failure in the lock or something. It's maybe a little paranoid but the engineer in me always looks for a "failproof" backup system when all goes wrong. How do you address this?
                      
                  
      We actually have a range of different products, with wired and battery-powered versions of every system. Most of them can be combined with traditional mechanical locks as a backup.The product we currently sell most is a reader unit (similar to rfid readers) that you connect to an external locking mechanism (e.g. an electric strike, motor lock, automatic door opener, etc.) and it's up to the customer to decide weather or not they still want a traditional cylinder installed into the door. For many doors, especially in offices, this is actually often not required (for example because there are several entrances to the room or its a door with a low-security mortise lock that can be opened with low effort in case of device failure).Our stand-alone solution is a retrofittable, battery-powered industrial grade motorized cylinder that actually connects to an existing mechanical cylinder, allowing you to still use your old keys.One very important thing that is never omitted though is that every door should open from inside in case of emergencies (e.g. fire) by purely mechanical means (turning a knob, pushing a door handle) and in commercial buildings also usually without keys.If you are interested in more information you can PM me and i'll send you some PDFs.
                      
                  
      If you click "Careers" and then "Products" on your site the text for products fades out rather than in.
                      
                  
      thanks!

      Hey, a friendly reminder. Iâ€™m parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map on
https://whoishiring.io or just HN items https://whoishiring.io/search/36.0440/-90.8984/4?source=hn
If you post here, please use the below format to help me with parsing. If you wonâ€™t, no worries, I will do my best to get all the things right.  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: ONSITE, REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, SALARY, company-url}

Iâ€™m using this regex to test the first line, you can test it here https://regex101.com/r/relwQD/3  \s*(?P<company>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<title>[^|]+?)\s*\|\s*(?P<locations>[^|]+?)\s*(?:\|\s*(?P<attrs>.+))?$
Check bellow for the SALARY regex.  SALARY:(?P<salary_min>\d+(?:k|K)?)(?:\s*\-\s*(?P<salary_max>\d+(?:k|K)?)?)?(?:\s?(?P<currency>[A-Z]{3}))?
and you can test it as well https://regex101.com/r/SRWkMz/2/There is the "report" button in footer of job offers, please complain if I did something wrong.
                      
                  
      Can we add a new category for REMOTE? It would be awesome to add "GLOBAL REMOTE" so I don't spend too much time looking in "REMOTE" post that only applies in the same country.
                      
                  
      Sometimes it doesn't have to be the same Country, but rather timezone.
                      
                  
      That's another consideration, but I think that one could go in the job's description, whereas NATIONAL REMOTE / GLOBAL REMOTE would be very helpful to include in the listing heading itself.
                      
                  
      Yes, that'd be much appreciated!
                      
                  
      Your site has helped me a lot. Your consistent improvements to both the job scraping and the UI have turned it into something special. Thanks!
                      
                  
      So, about "locations"... can you handle my free-form post now? (should be easy except possibly the Florida location, since all are in the first sentence) If not, how would I keep your regex from lumping them together? (I tried various things) Perhaps this would be more reliable if I could end the post with a set of latitude/longitude pairs.The post:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14462271Starting line:
Southeast USA including: Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), South Carolina (Greenville), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
                      
                  
      I'm sorry, I can't right now, the script finished after first match. I also know that creating multiple entries for this scenario would be just ridiculous, and you shouldn't do it.I will spend some time think about multiple location, but this probably will be limited only to those placed in the first line.Thanks for the feedback.

      Hi, I'm a new grad and I saw that on the careers page you guys have a new grad position available. Are you still somewhat interested in hiring for that role? Or do you recommend I apply for the backend role?
                      
                  
      Good question. The callout is about our biggest needs right now.  We're still hiring for everything on our careers page.We've filled most of our new grad positions for this year, but we're always on the lookout for strong candidates. Send me an email and we'll look at your experience and get back to you.Also, in practice if you are a new grad, whichever role you apply for we'll look at your resume/experience and realize you're a new grad -- so there is no practical difference. We're small enough that the way we look at things is still quite personal.Good luck with your search!

Devs publish their game and we spin up servers for them, make physics and networking work, support in-game currency, advertising, etc. Top games have 30k+ simul players, but the tail is very long.We have over 40m monthly active users, and some devs on the platform are making 100k USD/month (and are still in high school, and have hired their friends to form studios).We're hiring physics/rendering/networking C++ engineers, windows devops engineers (big scale), C# (or willing to learn) full stack engineers, and data scientists. Check it out at http://roblox.com - it's a downloadable client (to support native 60fps graphics).

      Square, Inc. | Software Engineer | Payments | Atlanta | Onsite | https://squareup.com/careers/jobsSquare's Atlanta office is hiring for multiple positions. We have several full-stack engineering teams in the office building features for our Point of Sale system as well as backend services that power our payments platform.  I am the hiring manager for our payments infrastructure team where we are building a next generation payments platform.
----
What we do:
Develop and support routing and gateway support between Squareâ€™s products and payment processors in the US and abroad.
----
Why it's cool:
Our system is critical: without it, some Square products couldn't exist.
Our Atlanta office has a history of working on mission critical projects.  Infrastructure used throughout Square was designed and developed here.  Weâ€™re continuing to increase our footprint here.
Our work environment includes lots of Silicon Valley style perks, plus all the advantages of working in a smaller office where everyone knows each other.
Square products are widely used by the general public, so you constantly run into people who use our products.
----
Who we're looking for:Engineers familiar with Java, Go, or Ruby or another high level OO language.
We are looking for candidates with industry experience.  Experience with Card Payments is a plus.
----
Tech we use: Java, Go, Ruby, Objective-C.
----

      I applied to Square over 3 months ago and the process is still ongoing (probably?). Had a third technical interview almost 3 weeks ago, haven't heard from them since. This is extremely frustrating.

      Hello,
Hope you are doing well!
My name is Irina and I work for Team Extension, a nearshoring and offshoring technology company based in Bucharest. Just to make it clear, we are not a recruiting company and have dedicated resources on company location.
I am contacting you about your recent post from news.ycombinator.com site. You are looking for a Frontend developer. It looks like a great opportunity as we have Frontend developers available. Will you be interested to discuss this over a short conference call on June 14th at 17:00 EET or June 17th at 18:00 EET.
Looking forward to hearing from you and have a nice day!
                      
                  
      I read it all, got so excited about working there, then, by the end... "US citizens only" :( Not that remote...
                      
                  
      This is a temporary requirement we'll be removing as we finalize some payroll/tax/logistics implications. Would still love to see your application!
                      
                  
      Great news! I will apply then! Thanks for keep checking the thread and answering it!

      Cloud Platform @ Twitter | San Francisco, CA | ONSITEWe're looking for engineers to come work on Twitter's Cloud Platform team in downtown San Francisco. All of Twitter's stateless services run on our platform, and this means we need to support hundreds of thousands of tasks running across tens of thousands of machines (and growing every day!).Our platform is almost entirely open sourced via Apache Mesos and Apache Aurora, and we're looking to push on and improve the efficiency, usability and reliability of our platform at our unique scale.We have the following technologies on our team:* Mesos - C++ - Isolation and resource management (https://github.com/apache/mesos)* Aurora - Java - Service scheduler. (https://github.com/apache/aurora)* Workflows - Scala/ReactJS - our internal Continuous Delivery platform* Analytics Pipeline - Scala/Python - our data pipeline to feed back to users to help them make smarter decisions about how they use our platform.* Operations - Python/Go/Puppet/etc. - The tooling we use to do all of this with a pretty painless oncall and only two SREs.As you can imagine, it's a great team for an experienced generalist who enjoys all parts of building a product, but we also have problems that a specialist in any of these areas would have a field day with.We're mostly looking for candidates who have at least a couple years experience designing (and implementing) complex systems in a team environment, as well as candidates excited about this space.If this interests you at all or you'd like more information on the work we're doing, our roadmap or any other questions, please get in touch at dm@twitter.com

      Really like what you're doing.I think it'd be really useful if you could show the types of visas companies are willing to sponsor especially US companies. You could show if they're sponsoring new H1Bs, H1B transfers, TN, etc.
                      
                  
      Thank you for your feedback. I do maintain flags per visa for "Sponsor", "Transfer" and if they'll process Green Card / Permanent Residency. Will work that into the UI soon.

      I've built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say that Scalyr is my favorite so far. We're building an amazing team, users rave about our product, and things are taking off â€“ we're closing seven-figure contracts and revenue grew 5x last year. And we're doing it on a sane, 40-hour, daily-team-hike, Fridays-at-home schedule. We're pre-series-A, but in many ways playing like a series B company, so this is a chance to get the best of both worlds -- early-stage equity and impact, with later-stage compensation and stability; plus a very strong team for peering or mentorship.Backend Engineer: We've built a NoSQL data engine from scratch that searches text at 750 GB/second. How'd you like to help us scale and optimize to multiple TB/second?Agent Engineer: you'll own our lean, mean data collection agent. If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything. You'll get to play with packages from Apache to Zookeeper, APIs from AWS to, er, Azure, while tackling challenges such as monitoring 100,000+ simultaneous log files using minimal CPU.Customer Success Engineer: our customers are engineers. We're looking for someone with lightweight ops experience and good communication skills to help them get the most out of Scalyr.

Mike Arpaia here, a Co-Founder of a host endpoint company called Kolide (https://kolide.com) and the original creator of the open-source security software osquery (https://github.com/facebook/osquery) which I put together as a solution to Facebook's HIDS problem when I worked there as an engineer.Kolide is building a team of software engineers to work on and contribute to the osquery codebase, which is an open-source C++ project. Open sourced by Facebook in 2014, osquery is an operating system instrumentation and analysis framework which solves a variety of monitoring and instrumentation use-cases. Since its release, osquery has become one of the most popular open source security software projects on all of GitHub with over 9,000 stars and 1,000 forks.The osquery engineering team at Kolide, led by me, the progenitor of the osquery project, will focus on improving the open source codebase for all users of osquery. Engineers will work closely with members of the core osquery team, osquery community members, and other Kolide employees to prioritize features and collaborate on development. Due to the distributed nature of the osquery open source project, this is a completely remote role; Candidates should feel comfortable working independently in a distributed fashion.The following attributes would be true of an ideal candidate:- Extensive experience writing C++- Deep knowledge of the operating system internals of macOS, Linux or Windows- A passion for open source software and community- Strong writing skills and the ability to express ideas via project proposals and design documents- Previous contributions to osquery are definitely a plus, but not strictly requiredIf this sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email at mike@kolide.com!

      Lob | YC S13, YC Continuity | Senior Software Engineer | Full Time, ONSITE | San Francisco, CAOur first API was to programmatically send physical mail. Our second, announced just yesterday (https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/31/ycs-continuity-fund-leads...), is CASS-certified address verification. Our long-term goal is to provide the building blocks for developers to automate the offline world through APIs.I'm the head of engineering at Lob. In between my last job and this one, I spoke to 42 organizations before I found what I was looking for in Lob: an exceptional team at the beginning of its growth phase, and also a company with a track record of being deliberate about its culture and which is intentionally building a good place to work.We are a small and mighty engineering team with a ton of product and infrastructure problems to solve as we keep pace with rapid growth. So, we're currently looking for experienced software engineers who can take ownership of entire projects. We hate contrived interviews, so our process rewards practical problem solving (based on real problems we've faced) and excellent communication.Apply at https://lob.com/careers or drop me a line at raph@lob.com if this intrigues you!
                      
                  
      Pathlight is the first platform dedicated to helping sales managers. These managers are critical to any organizationâ€™s success (and revenue), but are stuck with using whiteboards, email, and spreadsheets to do this vital job.Sales managers use Pathlight every day because it helps them control their team's pipeline, productivity, and development like they've been doing it for 20+ years.Weâ€™re looking for hungry and talented full-stack engineers to help us.Pros:  - Green field development. An opportunity to build things from scratch and own large parts of the stack.
  - Real world problems. The kind that companies pay $100K+ to solve.
  - Experienced founders. This is our 2nd startup - our first was acquired in 2013.
  - Well-funded and well-run. Series A, low burn. Capital efficiency is important to us.
  - Product market fit. Companies already using it every day.

Cons:  - Very early. Very uncertain.
  - Weâ€™re not going to match your offer from Facebook
  - No free lunches, gym memberships, massages, etc.
  - We play Yacht Rock on Fridays.

Our application pulls from a customerâ€™s existing CRM and uses a whole mess of buzz-words to perform our magic (cue shameless buzzword dump):  - Python/Django (Python3, Celery)
  - Machine learning (scikit-learn, numpy)
  - Thick frontend client (ES6/Babel/React/Redux)
