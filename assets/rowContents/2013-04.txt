      Do you offer visa assistance to successful candidates?I am a graduating student from India, who have shipped products and worked in a start-up. My Profile (https://gist.github.com/sravfeyn/13534c67812183235a2c/)
                      
                  
      New York / London - Bloomberghttp://jobs.bloomberg.com/
http://www.bloomberg.com/uxThere are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R&D. We do a huge variety of things and we like to run our teams with a startup results-driven feel.
We are primary consumers of billions of incoming pieces of data daily and redistribute it to over 180 countries on one of the largest private networks in the world, producing software which provides discovery, analytics, visualization and much more.Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com.If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. and we'll have a few people at JSConf in May.
                      
                  
      Working as a software engineer at a non-tech company would be a refreshing change of pace for a lot of people in tech.  Could you elaborate a bit more on what exactly an engineer would do on a daily basis and what the size of the team currently is?
                      
                  
      We are a tech company. We just don't look like one :) Tom (tptacek) always accuses me of not selling enough, so I'll give it a try.Your question is actually very open-ended. We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so you can imagine the work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.).I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level "app" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.All of what I mentioned is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion "ticks" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one "feed") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)We could use a motto like "We do a lot of stuff."
                      
                  
      How I wish Lakos's team was based somewhere in Europe...
I think Meredith also works in that team.
                      
                  
      Hi, has the 45 hour per week rule been changed?
                      
                  
      I've been here at BB a long time and I can tell you that there has never been any rule dictating a 45 hour work week. Where did you hear that from?
                      
                  
      During an interview at the London office I asked about working hours and I was told you can pick from either 8:00 to 18:00 or 9:00 to 19:00.I was also told that my money making side projects would not be allowed or would have to be "approved".The people who interviewed me were really nice though and they did not wear a suit.
                      
                  
      I worked in the London office as an intern, 45 hours a week was definitely the standard!.I'm fairly certain some of the teams weren't strict on it or even went with 40 hour weeks, but it's definitely 45 on the contract! Having said that, it's a great place and the internship was good fun
                      
                  
      What is the approach to remote working (becoming a meme here !)PSThat's quite an "interesting" photo at ishiboo.com
                      
                  
      We do not hire remote in R&D. Our main R&D offices are in NY/London with a smaller (mostly data) office in Princeton, NJ. The Government product is built out of Washington D.C. and a handful of other very specific things are built in Dublin, Lugano, and Tel Aviv.
                      
                  
      ishiboo.com is famous hacker Danny Dulai (aka nirva)'s domain. Seems like he does whatever he wants. So the picture doesn't reflect on that post.
                      
                  
      Is Danny famous? Apart from splitting his own tongue?I mean, he's obviously famous among his friends. :)Incidentally: I know Andrew well, and actually almost moved to NYC to work with him at Bloomberg. I think he is underselling the role a little bit. His team sits on top of one of the greatest mountains of real time data in the world, and gets paid to invent and execute cool things to do with it. I'm pretty familiar with the environment he's working in, and it is the least stereotypically "BigCo" environment in probably all of finance.If you're remotely interested in Andrew's problem domain, strongest possible recommend; go talk to him!
                      
                  
      The website under that picture read like an April fools joke.
                      
                  
      ok.Just struck me as an odd choice when posting for a seemingly suit and shirt place like Bloomberg.
                      
                  
      Haha, Bloomberg is not a suit and shirt place! When I worked there, I wore sandals, shorts, and a t-shirt. Lots of other people (including my manager's manager) did the same. There was also a guy dressed like a heavy metal rocker who was in meetings with guys in suits all the time.Also, Danny Dulai worked for Bloomberg.
                      
                  
      I just choose to interact with the net using my personal address :)As for attire, everyone wears whatever they want -- probably just like any other company posting here.
                      
                  
      I am officially retiring from this conversation :-)I did not mean to imply any improprietary, just a passing glance at a site, and a middle aged man who should know the by-ways of the net better (me).Sounds like a fun fire-hose to get to work with - enjoy.(Actually I would be interested in getting a flavour of the sizes of data sets, time constraints you work under, tools of choice (trading off performance and reliability) - real time massive data is where most of us are heading, would be interesting to hear letters back from Mason and Dixon)
                      
                  
      I must say the entry level training is also fantastic and the internships good fun, whilst (of course) challenging.
                      
                  
      Glad to hear you had a good time. For anyone wondering, I think internship app deadline has passed already for this summer -- I'll mention internships as well when the fall season rolls around.
                      
                  
      Ah shucks. If you find anything to the contrary, I'd love to hear from you!  If not, next summer it shall be.
                      
                  
      Awesome, looking forward to interning this summer.

      Transcriptic: Web DeveloperMenlo Park, CATranscriptic is "Amazon Web Services" for the life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer.  On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI.  Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user.  We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.We're a very small startup (you'd be #6), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.team at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/

Understand and appreciate the human-facing side of the business. You are comfortable thinking through what needs to be prioritized next and how that affects our customers.* Attentive to Detail. You know when to git merge and when to git rebase, and it makes a difference (nobody likes a messy commit history). Your code feels obvious in retrospect. You take pride in your work.* Test-Friendly. The best way to make sure we're creating value for our users is to make sure our changes don't break things.More info on the website, if you're interested you can apply on the site or you can contact me directly for more information.

The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.Weâ€™re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects.

Experience with these is a big plus, but weâ€™re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees.

      It's really a shame because the only jobs which really interested me in any way required US citizenship and security .One thing I'm curious about is this: is 2 years of experience really the lowest requirement for a junior developer? [1] It seems like if the applicant had any more, they could hardly be counted as a "junior developer" and would just be "a developer."[1] http://newton.newtonsoftware.com/career/JobIntroduction.acti...

      San Francisco / Portland, ORUrban Airship has tons of engineering and other positions open: http://urbanairship.com/careers/We help mobile app owners manage their users.  Customers drop our SDK into their app (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.), then they can go to our elegant web interface to send push notifications, setup triggered events, segment their audience, create a pass/offer for Passbook, and more.There are over 1 billion app installs with our SDK in it.  Many customers are huge brand name apps you would recognize (10M+ users each).  That's a lot of devices we push data to, and it's a lot of data coming back when devices phone home (analytics data, location data, etc.).  Our engineering targets for push are 100,000 messages sent per second or more.  It's interesting because a lot of our traffic is outbound (us sending things to phones) as well as inbound (phones calling back to us).  It's kind of crazy, we have to make sure we don't DDOS ourselves and our customers.I work on Audience Segmentation.  Customers can slice and dice who they want to send to.  We do a lot of GIS/location indexing, as well as indexing based on the preferences and behavior of mobile users.Our engineering roles are available in Portland or San Francisco, your choice.

      Instead of US Citizenship, you probably mean "legally authorized to work in the US".
                      
                  
      I don't know if it's the case here, but some agencies do defence work and so only hire people who they can get security clearance for.
                      
                  
      Regarding US Citizenship requirement - any other reasons besides accounting/paperwork difficulties?

No need for a carâ€”Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and internationalâ€”no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.4. Easy work permissionsâ€”Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, weâ€™d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.=> http://urge.io/jobsIf you are doing Node.js or JS, apply todayâ€”we are looking for multiple Node.js Software Engineers.

      Software Engineers in Boston area (Waltham, MA)Actifio (http://www.actifio.com) is looking for software engineers. Actifio is radically simple copy data management. We've invented some really cool technology to do things no other system can, and we're dead easy to use. This is not your mother's enterprise software!Actifio has been invested in by top VC firms (one of the very few East Coast companies in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio) and is growing super fast. Recently, we closed a 50 million dollar round of funding.We're always looking for smart engineers in every team, but since I'm on the deduplication team, I'll have to pitch you on that :) Briefly, our other teams include Java, C++, and Adobe Air, and work on things like VMware interaction, snapshot management, scheduling, databases, etc.As for the dedup team: we write in C, and use Python for debugging and support scripts. Dedup seems like an easy problem to solve, because it's so conceptually simple: split the data up into blocks and make sure you only store one of each. But at scale, it becomes a whole different animal.
When you've got 128TB of 4KB blocks, you have 32 billion unique blocks of data to manage. Making our dedup ingest, restore, and garbage collect fast is a great challenge, especially with "only" 128 GB of RAM.If you'd like to chat about a job opportunity (in dedup or otherwise!), I'm at chris.murphy@actifio.com. Since I'm an engineer, I'm not going to type a list of silly requirements. Just send me a resume and whatever else you think I'd like to know.
                      
                  
      Amsterdam -- Full time -- Full stack developer, Rails/JS focus -- SuperSaaS.comSuperSaaS develops the highly successful online scheduling website www.supersaas.(com|de|fr|it|jp|nl|\w\w).Scheduling is a hard problem: To determine the space available for an appointment you need to take into account opening hours, existing appointments, holidays, availability of linked resources such as treatment rooms, and about ten other things. Now do that for every page view and API call and in such a way that it can scale to thousands of clients. And this needs to be presented in a way the user understands in 25 different languages (including right-to-left), multiple currencies, multiple time zones and needs to look good on a variety of devices.As can be expected in a nascent billion dollar market there are many competitors, but unlike many other markets the usability and the quality of the algorithms make a big difference to business success. This means a great programmer can get the respect he deserves here: Above average salary, equity options, pick your own equipment, extremely flexible working hours. SuperSaaS is still tiny but has been consistently profitable since going live 5 years ago, while enjoying triple digit growth rates.Interested?

      Wello: SF or REMOTE fulltime (near pacific time)At Wello (https://www.wello.com), we are rethinking how people get fit. Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and thus eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market.Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distances comfortably. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. Almost all of us have worked at other companies before so while we dont have nerf guns, we still know how to have fun.Our technical stack is Python/Django and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ. We also use services like CircleCI, Optimizely, MixPanel, SegmentIO and Asana for getting things done.Contact us at dev@wello.co.

But we're experiencing an amazing amount of success working with large hospital systems around the country, and we need your coding skills and imagination to do it better.  We haven't gotten around to issuing a press release in a while, but now we have multiple products and A-list customers are coming to us without any advertising whatsoever, and we need all the help we can get to constantly improve our products and dream up new ones for the healthcare industry.So come write some Ruby with us.You don't have to be a ninja rockstar astronaut guru sommelier kind of Rubyist, but if you are, that's fantastic!  :)  We have a lot on our plate and highly experienced folks would be a great asset.  However, if you're just a smart, passionate, friendly developer with no Ruby on Rails experience but consider yourself a decently quick learner, then we'd be interested in talking to you as well.

Please consider coming on board if you like companies with no bureaucracy and huge growth prospects!

We're approaching a point where traditional university credentialing isn't enough, skills are changing too quickly and what makes someone effective in a role or job is evolving. New roles appear daily that no (or few) traditional universities have courses for: e.g. growth hacker, social media evangelist, CNC machinist / programmer. People are acquiring more and more skills through non-traditional means. Nascent "education 2.0" initiaitives are exciting, but they still face the problem of measuring and credentialing, especially those that learn online.How do you show what you know?Smarterer has created an innovative testing system and scoring algorithm that allows rapid evolution of content, skill measurment, and question characterization. We've made it fun as well as rigorous, based on modern testing theories.Smarterer is helping enable a revolution: in the changing job marketplace, in education and learning, and in the way people measure their own skills and share that knowledge.Our mission: Measure the world's skillsMore job details here:

We generally believe in using the right tool for a give job. If you want to tackle a particular problem with OCaml, for instance, you probably won't face much friction.We have an office right next to the Caltrain in San Mateo (15 mi south of SF) and are willing to let people work remotely if they can do it well. We will also cover relocation for good people.

Suffice it to say that this is a super hot space, so if you like sports and making money, this could be the place for you.We're built on RoR, founded by highly successful internet marketers (as in, tens of millions of users and hundreds of millions of dollars), and we have a ridiculously nice office in downtown SF with a sky high view of the Bay and all three bridges.Seed round secured. The original engineering team has built the basic product but is staying on with our incubator, and we now need a tech lead to join DoubleUp for an external funding round and spin off with the core team as a co-founding CTO.Reach out to russ @ doubleup.com after checking out our site, and let me know where you'd like to fit in.
