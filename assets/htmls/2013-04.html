                  <span class="c00">We are a tech company. We just don't look like one :) Tom (tptacek) always accuses me of not selling enough, so I'll give it a try.<p>Your question is actually very open-ended. We have roughly 4,000 R&#38;D employees, so you can imagine the work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.).<p>I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level "app" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&#38;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion "ticks" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one "feed") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like "We do a lot of stuff."<span>

Apart from splitting his own tongue?<p>I mean, he's obviously famous among his friends. :)<p>Incidentally: I know Andrew well, and actually almost moved to NYC to work with him at Bloomberg. I think he is underselling the role a little bit. His team sits on top of one of the greatest mountains of real time data in the world, and gets paid to invent and execute cool things to do with it. I'm pretty familiar with the environment he's working in, and it is the least stereotypically "BigCo" environment in probably all of finance.<p>If you're remotely interested in Andrew's problem domain, strongest possible recommend; go talk to him!<span>

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer.  On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI.  Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user.  We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>We're a very small startup (you'd be #6), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.<p>A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.<p>team at transcriptic.com<p><a href="https://www.transcriptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.transcriptic.com/</a><span>

Mountain View, CA<p>We're a well funded 14 month old startup just starting to poke our heads out of stealth mode. We're reimagining what internet access looks like in the modern world. We've proven and prototyped a lot of the necessary components. They work.<p>We are looking for true generalists. Yes, some of our work is in Python and Django, but we also have to work with embedded device C code, internal APIs for client applications, networking and firewall configuration and at times even finding and working around the occasional kernel panic. Silly kernel, everything is going to be OK. You are;<p>* A Polyglot Programmer. Contribute all up and down the stack, from JavaScript and Python to C and shell scripting, from traditional MVC web development down to TCP/IP, DNS and iptables.<p>* Autodidactic. Learning is fun. Prepare to do a lot of it. We have way more components than team members and we intend to keep it that way.<p>* Autonomous. Be comfortable working with minimal oversight. We don’t have any PMs and we don’t plan to hire any for quite some time. Downside: you don’t get a spec. Upside: you don’t get a spec.<p>* Product-focused. Understand and appreciate the human-facing side of the business. You are comfortable thinking through what needs to be prioritized next and how that affects our customers.<p>* Attentive to Detail. You know when to git merge and when to git rebase, and it makes a difference (nobody likes a messy commit history). Your code feels obvious in retrospect. You take pride in your work.<p>* Test-Friendly. The best way to make sure we're creating value for our users is to make sure our changes don't break things.<p>More info on the website, if you're interested you can apply on the site or you can contact me directly for more information.<span>

Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US - but our office culture is so great that you might really want to be here beside us!<p>Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We were recently named one of "50 Disruptive Companies in 2013" by MIT Technology Review (<a href="http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/" rel="nofollow">http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/</a>). We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure (<a href="http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure" rel="nofollow">http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure</a>), machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews</a><span>

We’re helping Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other sites that you’ve probably heard of serve billions of ads per month. At that scale, things get very interesting.<p>Adzerk engineers are responsible for working on all parts of the system. This includes the front-end web application, back-end services, and the ad delivery engines. Our platform is built using Node.js with Coffeescript, Mono, JQuery, MongoDB and Hadoop, with a whole lot of AWS and Chef. We’re currently serving over 10,000 req/sec (and growing fast), so you’ll get to work on some real scalability challenges.<p>Performance and scalability are our two primary concerns, and with the traffic and growth rates that we’re experiencing, lots of the lessons that you’ve learned start to break down. Because of that, it’s not as important what you know right now – what matters is how quickly you can learn and adapt.<p>- Your work will have an immediate and profound impact on our product and business.<p>- We ship code dozens of times a week, and you will write code and push to production on your first day.<p>- You will be responsible for making important decisions about what tools and libraries we use.<p>- You will have a direct role in building the team, helping us choose additional team members as we grow in size.<p>- We test and review our code. All changes come through pull requests.<p>- We prize open source contribution. You should have a GitHub account already.<p>- Everyone gets equity. We want a team of partners.<p>- Unlimited vacation. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace.<p>- Flexible work schedule, including working at home part-time if you want.<p>If you think you might be a great fit, drop us a line at jobs@adzerk.com.<span>

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<p>We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.<span>

As our first hire and only front-end specialist, you'll drive the function and feel of our UI, creating entirely new ways of interacting with data. You’ll meet weekly with the designer of the TiVo UI (an advisor of ours) to sketch out solutions to extremely challenging usability problems, which you'll then implement. You'll code in HTML, CSS/LESS, Ruby, and Coffeescript, using Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, and d3. And as the first hire, you’ll earn significant equity and help shape our culture.<p>The ideal candidate:
. Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product
. Comfortable with UI and UX challenges. Graphic design skills are a bonus (we currently have none).
. Interested in data analysis.
. An extremely talented programmer, skilled with front end tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Coffeescript. 
. Familiarity with the other tools listed above is a bonus.
. Deeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and front end architecture.
. Open to asking for help, taking feedback, collaborating, and generally being a team player.
. Humor. Has a sense of it.<span>

The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way. At SwiftStack, we’re committed to strong participation in the OpenStack ecosystem in general and to contribution to Swift in particular. You’ll be a contributor to one of the most important Open Source projects currently active.<p>You’ll confront interesting problems every day. Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you. We’ll be back in touch shortly to get the conversation started.<span>

Customers drop our SDK into their app (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.), then they can go to our elegant web interface to send push notifications, setup triggered events, segment their audience, create a pass/offer for Passbook, and more.<p>There are over 1 billion app installs with our SDK in it.  Many customers are huge brand name apps you would recognize (10M+ users each).  That's a lot of devices we push data to, and it's a lot of data coming back when devices phone home (analytics data, location data, etc.).  Our engineering targets for push are 100,000 messages sent per second or more.  It's interesting because a lot of our traffic is outbound (us sending things to phones) as well as inbound (phones calling back to us).  It's kind of crazy, we have to make sure we don't DDOS ourselves and our customers.<p>I work on Audience Segmentation.  Customers can slice and dice who they want to send to.  We do a lot of GIS/location indexing, as well as indexing based on the preferences and behavior of mobile users.<p>Our engineering roles are available in Portland or San Francisco, your choice.  We also have a Digital Wallet team in Palo Alto that is going hard at Passbook and other digital wallet tools.<p>If you interested email me at ben (at) urbanairship (dot) com.

It’s clever technology is helping successful businesses to stay on top of their ever growing number of customer and contact relationships in a social world. Instead of company data being scattered across multiple applications and employees wasting time on searching for the right pieces of customer info, Unifyo provides instant access to unified customer profiles, without any complex setup or integration work. Less time spent on searching, more time spent on business.<p>We are adding two people to our team of 7:<p>1) Online Marketing / Growth hacking – responsible for user acquisition and overall growth. If you have great communication skills, you love to experiment with user acquisition techniques and you are into measuring what works and what doesn't, then we'd love to hear from you.<p>2) Sales / Customer Success – convert users to paying customers. The likes of Yammer and other "free to sign up" services didn't scale by simply cold-calling companies, but by making sure that people and companies which did sign up got the most out of their products, converted into paying customers and made sure every employee is using their products. Little cold-calling but lots of selling by making sure our users use Unifyo successfully - if that sounds like a plan to you, get in touch.<p>We’re a small, fun team, with an emphasis on enjoying our work and learning. We are a Seedcamp funded company (Europe's biggest startup accelerator), so you'll have access to a huge mentor network. Getting involved will be a great way to learn and gain loads of experience really really fast. We’ll also offer a competitive salary and stock options so you can share in the company’s success.<p>Contact me directly: ben@unifyo.com or check out <a href="https://unifyo.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://unifyo.com/jobs</a><span>

Full Time, Intern<p>We are hiring Software Engineers, DevOps, and DBAs at all levels, from fresh meat to veteran architects.
Our product domain is web-based enterprise applications for regulated industries.  We are growing rapidly and gaining market share.  We write web-based software that provides our clients with powerful and intuitive tools to manage their documents.<p>Our engineering team is diverse and senior-heavy - we have a few startup veterans, a Haskell guy, some people who like speaking at conferences and meetups, and even some game developers. We used AJAX before it was called AJAX.  The engineering “managers” aren’t really managers - they’re the ones who architected the products and lead their maintenance. Engineers in charge means no red tape or other silly productivity barriers like at larger companies.<p><a href="http://www.wingspan.com/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wingspan.com/careers/</a>

                  <span class="c00">BERLIN/GERMANY, NODE.JS/JAVASCRIPT, FULL-TIME, LOCATED IN THE FACTORY NEXT TO GOOGLE, SOUNDCLOUD &#38; MOZILLA<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:<p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest standard of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.<p>5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.<p>=&#62; <a href="http://urge.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://urge.io/jobs</a><p>If you are doing Node.js or JS, apply today—we are looking for multiple Node.js Software Engineers.<span>

We’re looking for a talented and passionate developer to help improve and expand our web-based application, FormAssembly. The ideal candidate can craft code that’s robust and easy to maintain, switch between back-end and front-end development, and keep usability and user experience in mind at all times. You’ll work on our LAMP stack, as well as new projects with a clean slate, for which you’ll help pick the best technologies, architecture, and tools. You’ll work autonomously or with the team depending on the project, and will get many opportunities to share, teach, and learn from your coworkers.<p>UX Engineer
Designing user interactions around web form building and data collection is a real challenge. If you’ve ever had to fill out a form online and cursed at your screen, you know what we’re trying to improve. We’re looking for a front-end developer / user experience designer. You have the technical skills (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) that allow you to imagine, design, and implement new features. You pay attention to details, and you’re an empathetic person, capable of evaluating your work with the eye of a typical user.<p>Sys-Admin
We’ve grown and we need a dedicated System Administrator to maintain, monitor, and improve our high-availability infrastructure. You should be familiar with the LAMP stack and software like nginx and memcache, as well as monitoring and deployment tools. You’ll be responsible for maintaining the highest security standards, improving and testing our disaster recovery plan, recommending and implementing infrastructure upgrades, and shaving off milliseconds after milliseconds from our application’s response time.<p>------
Your work will get in front of tens of thousands of users and help make data collection easier for a lot of people, from schools enrolling students to large corporations improving their business processes.
We're confortable working with remote workers and have sponsored successfully H1B applicants in the past.

                  <span class="c00">SF - Rails/JS - HALF-TIME with benefits (or FULL-TIME)<p>I mentioned a couple months ago that we have a few engineers who work half-time-ish (and do their own things the rest of the time) and it got some positive feedback: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235860" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235860</a><p>We're looking to hire a couple more engineers who are interested in being part of a team but would prefer to work 24-40 hours per week instead of the usual 50+. If it sounds interesting let me know (ragalie@verbasoftware.com)<p>=========<p>About us:<p>The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.<p>About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore's offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.<p>We're looking for people familiar with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems on the technical side, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck, and we're always looking for ways to provide more control to our support team so they can provide top-notch customer service.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.<p>We're also looking for a part-time designer/front-end person! If you have good taste and know HTML/CSS/SCSS inside-out, drop us a line.<p>And be sure to check out our website (<a href="http://www.verbasoftware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.verbasoftware.com</a>) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)<span>

Actifio is radically simple copy data management. We've invented some really cool technology to do things no other system can, and we're dead easy to use. This is not your mother's enterprise software!<p>Actifio has been invested in by top VC firms (one of the very few East Coast companies in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio) and is growing super fast. Recently, we closed a 50 million dollar round of funding.<p>We're always looking for smart engineers in every team, but since I'm on the deduplication team, I'll have to pitch you on that :) Briefly, our other teams include Java, C++, and Adobe Air, and work on things like VMware interaction, snapshot management, scheduling, databases, etc.<p>As for the dedup team: we write in C, and use Python for debugging and support scripts. Dedup seems like an easy problem to solve, because it's so conceptually simple: split the data up into blocks and make sure you only store one of each. But at scale, it becomes a whole different animal.
When you've got 128TB of 4KB blocks, you have 32 billion unique blocks of data to manage. Making our dedup ingest, restore, and garbage collect fast is a great challenge, especially with "only" 128 GB of RAM.<p>If you'd like to chat about a job opportunity (in dedup or otherwise!), I'm at chris.murphy@actifio.com. Since I'm an engineer, I'm not going to type a list of silly requirements. Just send me a resume and whatever else you think I'd like to know.<span>

Now do that for every page view and API call and in such a way that it can scale to thousands of clients. And this needs to be presented in a way the user understands in 25 different languages (including right-to-left), multiple currencies, multiple time zones and needs to look good on a variety of devices.<p>As can be expected in a nascent billion dollar market there are many competitors, but unlike many other markets the usability and the quality of the algorithms make a big difference to business success. This means a great programmer can get the respect he deserves here: Above average salary, equity options, pick your own equipment, extremely flexible working hours. SuperSaaS is still tiny but has been consistently profitable since going live 5 years ago, while enjoying triple digit growth rates.<p>Interested?

Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and thus eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.<p>We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market.<p>Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.<p>We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distances comfortably. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. Almost all of us have worked at other companies before so while we dont have nerf guns, we still know how to have fun.<p>Our technical stack is Python/Django and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ. We also use services like CircleCI, Optimizely, MixPanel, SegmentIO and Asana for getting things done.<p>Contact us at dev@wello.co.<span>

We ship instrumentation extensions for a growing list of web servers and application languages (Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, etc) that follow &#38; monitor web requests as they are forwarded between processes and servers.<p>We sit atop mountains of data and strive to provide intelligent, actionable insights for our customers about the performance of their app's code &#38; servers.  Processing &#38; visualizing it all (at scale) is a big challenge, and we’re looking for talented engineers to help us.<p>Our current (and growing) "big data" stack consists of have a data faucet and processing pipeline that does a ton of writes (Python, Cassandra, Hadoop, MySQL, Celery, C/C++, etc), a web backend that does a comparably lower number of reads (Python), and an elegant, powerful interface (Backbone, D3, jQuery).  We also use TBone, a Backbone library that we open-sourced that automagically manages data dependencies for you: <a href="http://tbonejs.org" rel="nofollow">http://tbonejs.org</a><p>We're a small team backed by a strong, growing company that is investing heavily in our product's future.

Successful business owners seeking a full-time Rails developer with strong back-end coding and testing skills to join our development team for a new business venture.<p>We are looking for someone who:
- Has experience building and deploying production applications in Rails 3.
- Confidently embraces unit testing and integration testing in daily work.
- Considers application architecture and refactors regularly to that end.<p>You might be the right fit if:
- You Love Ruby and have significant experience with Rails.
- You know your way around RSpec and/or MiniTest, and can converse knowledgeably on the pros/cons
 of TDD.
- You've heard of Turnip and Spinach and know how they differ from Cucumber.
- You're not afraid to write raw SQL.
- You can explain HABTM vs HMT.
- You're comfortable with git, branches, merges, etc.
- You know your way around a Linux server, and have a notion of how you might deploy a Rails application from start to finish without using Heroku.
- You understand that "skinny controllers, fat models" is only a partial solution, and you can name several ways
 to keep a growing Rails application object-oriented while preventing the models from becoming jumbled bags of methods.
- You understand the concept of writing some unit tests without Rails as a dependency.
- You've at least thought about ways to treat Rails as the delivery mechanism rather than as the application, and you are open to exploring this further.<p>We are open to flexible work arrangements and you will be part of a team that includes a designer, a front-end developer and another Rails expert.

Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS also needed.<p>Front-end developer: you can make Web sites do exactly what you want them to do, regardless of the browser or operating system the web site is running on. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required.<p>Back-end developers: you know what it takes to power the back-end of large web sites. You understand scalability issues and can explain the difference between an inner and outer join. You know what O(log N) is and why it's important.

Looking for competent technical talent who are willing to move to Europe (unless you're already here). We have many expats working here and we'll even help pay for Dutch lessons, if you want them.<p>We also like people who understand business because you'll be expected to make many of your own decisions without having to ask permission from management for every little thing that you do.

We're approaching a point where traditional university credentialing isn't enough, skills are changing too quickly and what makes someone effective in a role or job is evolving. New roles appear daily that no (or few) traditional universities have courses for: e.g. growth hacker, social media evangelist, CNC machinist / programmer. People are acquiring more and more skills through non-traditional means. Nascent "education 2.0" initiaitives are exciting, but they still face the problem of measuring and credentialing, especially those that learn online.<p>How do you show what you know?<p>Smarterer has created an innovative testing system and scoring algorithm that allows rapid evolution of content, skill measurment, and question characterization. We've made it fun as well as rigorous, based on modern testing theories.<p>Smarterer is helping enable a revolution: in the changing job marketplace, in education and learning, and in the way people measure their own skills and share that knowledge.<p>Our mission: Measure the world's skills<p>More job details here:

We have everything from server level monitoring/control agents to protocol proxies to backend metrics systems that need love.<p><i>Operations/devops</i> - If you have used chef/puppet or similar, get irritated about "snowflakes" (one off servers), and have a sometimes irrational desire to automate everything, you are someone we want to talk to. We are one of the companies where operations is the product, so work on the backend systems will often make its way in front of users.<p>[Whatever you do well] - If you have some combination of skills that you think we need, let us know why we should be thinking about them.<p>----------------------------------------------<p>Our tech "stack" is largely node.js/Ruby/Mongo/Redis (and now Erlang), we've experimented with various languages and other databases. We generally believe in using the right tool for a give job. If you want to tackle a particular problem with OCaml, for instance, you probably won't face much friction.<p>We have an office right next to the Caltrain in San Mateo (15 mi south of SF) and are willing to let people work remotely if they can do it well. We will also cover relocation for good people. Our priority is "people who get things done, sometimes in anger" and almost everything else is negotiable.<p>If you're interested, email hello@mongohq.com and ask us some questions (or tell us a story).

Suffice it to say that this is a super hot space, so if you like sports and making money, this could be the place for you.<p>We're built on RoR, founded by highly successful internet marketers (as in, tens of millions of users and hundreds of millions of dollars), and we have a ridiculously nice office in downtown SF with a sky high view of the Bay and all three bridges.<p>Seed round secured. The original engineering team has built the basic product but is staying on with our incubator, and we now need a tech lead to join DoubleUp for an external funding round and spin off with the core team as a co-founding CTO.<p>Reach out to russ @ doubleup.com after checking out our site, and let me know where you'd like to fit in.<span>
