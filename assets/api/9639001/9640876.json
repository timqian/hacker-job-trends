A lot of our work consists of following the latest developments in computer vision research, and then optimizing them so they run snappily on a mobile device, and then pushing them out to customers with a very quick turnaround. <p>Last year, we launched Structure Sensor, the first depth sensor for mobile (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;structure.io, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kck.st&#x2F;16BkwuO\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;structure.io, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kck.st&#x2F;16BkwuO</a>).<p>However, fundamentally Occipital is a software company (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;occipital.com&#x2F;about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;occipital.com&#x2F;about</a>), and we dedicate a lot of efforts on research in mobile computer vision software. We’ve already released early prototypes of real-time object scanning, indoor mapping and augmented reality demos, but we want to push the boundaries of computer vision much further and enable practical 3D vision on mobile devices.<p>Additionally, we are interested in people who are passionate about creating applications that exist in the real 3D environment around us, including Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, and are comfortable in exploiting the latest advances in Computer Vision. We regularly accept internships.<p>Please email dustin@occipital.com","time":1433182648,"type":"comment"}
