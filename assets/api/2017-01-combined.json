It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (65,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

I think we should separate the two codebases.  The Backbone Javascript codebase could then use be set up with modern tooling such as npm, webpack, etc.<p>* Some folks have thought we should scrap the Backbone codebase entirely and rebuild it using a newer framework like React or Angular.  But, I believe that it&#x27;s too large for that, and I&#x27;d prefer a moderate approach where, we upgrade to the latest Backbone version, perhaps using Marionette as well, while also refactoring &#x2F; cleaning the codebase.  We could also refactor it to use a v2 of the Rails API.<p>You should be a modern Javascript expert who has worked on many (minimum 2-5) Backbone.js projects.  You should be comfortable and passionate enough about Backbone.js to be willing and interested to refactor a large, existing app to be more performant, easier to work with, and so on.<p>So -- and thank you for reading this far -- basically we have a great opportunity -- lots of well paid, very comfortable, steady, challenging and interesting work, for the right person.<p>We offer very competitive pay, a very diverse, friendly, modern (unlimited snacks and drinks! not too many meetings!) and relaxed work environment, as well as valuable stock options.

You will implement new data processing and analysis methods so that they are accessible from the GUI. Sometimes a new device will have to be integrated in the software, so you’ll have to write a wrapper around the driver.<p>Skills &amp; Requirements<p>+ Our GUI is written in Python and Qt using the pyQt bindings and makes extensive use of twisted for asynchronous communication with devices and the database, so some prior knowledge about object-oriented Python is essential and knowledge of Qt and twisted would be beneficial<p>+ Data are stored in a CouchDB database, so some understanding of NoSQL document stores is helpful. At the least, you should know how to write some Javascript to be able to write new views.<p>+ Data and Image Analysis is mostly done using Python (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and scikit-image), so prior exposure will help you get up to the task much quicker.<p>+ Being a startup, we are a small team that has to handle a lot of different things, so flexibility, quick learning and good team communication skills are essential.<p>Why work with us?<p>+ We acknowledge your creativity and input, due to our lean organizational structure.<p>+ Close customer contacts guarantee diverse projects and never boredom.<p>+ Highly interesting insights in innovative bio-medical research projects.<p>If this attracts your attention, please send us your CV (ideally including a link to your github account, if existing) and cover letter or email k.schuetze at celltool.de for any further questions.","time":1483377664,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jcnhvnhck","id":13310849,"parent":13301832,"text":"SimplyCredit (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplycreditinc.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplycreditinc.com&#x2F;</a>) | Scala and Clojure Engineers | SF Bay Area<p>We are looking for talented Scala and Clojure engineers eager for a defining role in building a company.

Because you actually clicked into this, we’re going to assume you&#x27;re a solid PHP developer, experienced with both the old (PEAR, Smarty, pre-OOP, pre-MVC) and the new (Laravel&#x2F;Symfony, composer, PSR, etc).<p>Great! Now let’s talk about some of those as they relate to this position.<p>1.      Big Data – DRN is the world leader in license plate recognition and currently has more than 5 billion (with a B) rows of license plate and geospatial data.<p>2.      PHP – We love PHP. We know it has a bad reputation due to a long history of ugliness – and trust us when we say we have experienced it first-hand. However, it has matured greatly over the past few years and it has allowed us to rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy some amazing applications. We love Laravel and composer, and we have PHP 7 in production.<p>3.      SQL – Yeah, it’s weird to have PHP connect to SQL Server. And as a PHP developer, you may not have the strongest grasp on SQL Server and all of its idiosyncrasies. But we’re available to help walk you through it.<p>4.      Linux – Even though we run SQL server, our web servers are fully Ubuntu.<p>5.      Remote – Let’s dispel with the myth that remote developers can kick their feet back and play Xbox. If you’ve spent any time working remotely, you know the challenges and determination it takes to make it work. We work hard from 8 to 5 and want a developer that will do the same without needless distractions.<p>6.      Git – We do everything in git and have some great deployment workflows built around it.<p>7.      Security – Stop here if you have no idea what the OWASP Top 10 is. If you aren’t familiar with how to secure your code against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, then we can’t bring you aboard.<p>What is DRN? Here’s a little spiel about us from our marketing department:<p>&quot;DRN is the dominant provider of license plate recognition and vehicle location data to the automotive finance industry.

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients’ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider. We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>Our stack is native Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C), our API is served in a Ruby on Rails monolith and Scala services, on top of MySQL, Cassandra, ElasticSearch and Spark. We are especially focusing on expanding our frontend team as we see significant growth on that side of the product. We are mostly Backbone + React, although some more complex state we are moving to Redux. It&#x27;s a very exciting time for the frontend, as we are planning to grow both in scale in terms of patient populations, as well as product use cases that require diverse interactions. It is super rewarding to see our product affect real people&#x27;s lives and the opportunity to reinvent this massive industry is enormous.<p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs</a> Also feel free to reach out to me at nam@wellframe.com!","time":1483392329,"type":"comment"},{"by":"kaizensoze","id":13311903,"parent":13301832,"text":"Guidepoint | New York City | iOS | ONSITE | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guidepoint.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guidepoint.com&#x2F;</a><p>Looking for someone to potentially take over a Swift 3 project.<p>contact: hnleads@gmail.com","time":1483469838,"type":"comment"},{"by":"janlin1999","id":13304905,"kids":[13306275],"parent":13301832,"text":"DocSpot | Entry-level Back-end Developer | Sunnyvale, CA | ONSITE<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full-time entry-level back-end developer to build some infrastructure support services geared towards startups.
