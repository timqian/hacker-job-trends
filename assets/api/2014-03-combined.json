You’ll have a ton of technical autonomy: should we use Ember, Backbone, something else, or nothing? You lead those decisions.<p>Why us:\nWe’re funded, which means we can pay competitive salaries and offer benefits. We’re also small, which means we don’t waste time on things like tracking vacation and sick days. Our passion is building great products and our goal is to bring them to a wider audience than the web ever let us reach.

Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.\nIf you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

I&#x27;m 24 now, and I&#x27;m in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.

Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:<p>1st class engineer <p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript&#x2F;Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura &amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs &amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality<p>Data hungry <p>You’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.<p>Open all hours <p>You’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.<p>Solver of riddles <p>You won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.<p>Getting shit done <p>You’ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren’t perfect, but you’ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.<p>Commercially aware <p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.<p>Keen eye, tuned ear <p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.<p>Security and speed <p>You’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we’re after. But then you already know that.<p>About We Are Base<p>We&#x27;re a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.<p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.<p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We’re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.<p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.<p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work.

SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we&#x27;ve got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.<p>So far this year, we&#x27;ve built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive&#x27;s gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We&#x27;re currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].<p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don&#x27;t realize it.
