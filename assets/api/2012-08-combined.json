The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors.

We bootstrapped our company from two people (designer and engineer) to 11, and along the way learned a lot of lessons. A few of them are:<p>1. Building tools that make our jobs easier in the future is smart and gives our agency an edge. You will be expected to constantly try to improve our process, and your voice will be heard.<p>2. Following that point, if you think something should change? Do it. Let me know about it (CEO), get buy in from the other engineers, and don't wreck our timelines. But stop talking and start doing!<p>3. Salespeople will never estimate your project officially. Ultimately, I will bring in a project, lay it in front of you, and ask the team to do a planning poker session. Your velocity is set at a scant 10 points, and the timeline is bid against that initial velocity. Under promise, over deliver.<p>4. If you estimate poorly, you are expected to fix it. If the project just went off the rails due to things out of your control, then your feet won't be held to the fire, but if it's genuinely your fault, fix it. It's completely in your control.<p>5. Try the impossible. We built The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, an impossible feat for it's day. We've built complex interfaces for Cisco, Symantec, and now are working with O'Reilly. Don't be afraid to use 2D Game frameworks if you have to. People don't contract Twin Engine Labs to do the status quo.<p>6. Be a full stack engineer. Know iOS but not Rails? Talk to us. Know Rails but not iOS? Talk to us. You will be placed in projects of your capacity, but very quickly ramped up to both  platforms. We expect you to know everything from server deployments to iOS deployments, to Postgres optimization to Core Data optimization, from caching in Restful APIs to caching NSURL connections. Being a full stack engineer allows you to move faster than every other shop out there.<p>7. Finally, work directly with the customer. You, as the engineer, will always be expected to speak with the customer faster than I can. I will <i>always</i> give you air cover when you need it (and I typically can see that coming from a mile away). As well, you'll hear their requirements from their mouths (no games of telephone here), and get to ask them questions, with the safety net that I always stand behind our employees.<p>Perks? Multiple projects in a year, constantly learning the cutting edge techniques, and some seriously huge names under your belt.<p>Our environment is flat. No Pointy Haired Bosses allowed or bean counters here. Paint yourself purple, turn yourself upside down, and spin around three times while you code. As long as you deliver, I don't care how you do it.<p>Employees come into work at what is a reasonable hour to them. Our employees set their own start times, with flexible work at home situations when required. Most of them come into work because... well... we like each other :)<p>Intrigued? Talk to us.

Zipkin (<a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/</a>) is an example of the kinds of tools our team is building right now. The two central components are a dashboard/charting monitoring service as well as our own alerting system.<p>Most of our infrastructure challenges stem from the sheer number of writes we need to deal with as well as the temporal nature of what we're doing - all of our writes need to happen within certain time periods and reads have to be consistent within certain time-frames to avoid engineers being woken up at 4am due to incorrect data from a dirty read. Given that we're the service which observes all the other critical components - our reliability requirements are also a huge challenge.<p>The product challenge on this team is making sense of a whole lot of data. So there is a lot of cutting-edge data visualisation work. You have certain services running on thousands of nodes and teams want to use our product to quickly find outliers and scan their dashboards with key metrics. This means you have potentially thousands of timeseries with thousands of data points on the screen at the same time. This is a JavaScript gig where you get to think about algorithms and performance on a daily basis. We're also an internal tool, so we have the option of targeting cutting edge, modern browser features. In reality it means 90% of your time is working on cool stuff and not on getting IE to work.<p>I think the biggest benefit of working on our product team is that you a level of autonomy which is hard to find on a user-facing product.
