Team High Fidelity has a deep legacy of expertise in software development, social entertainment, peer-based recognition systems, community development, and workforce mobilization. We believe that both the hardware and the internet infrastructure are now available to give people around the world access to an interconnected Metaverse that will offer a broad range of capabilities for creativity, education, exploration, and play. And by using all of our computers together in an open shared network, we can simulate this space at a far larger scale than would be possible by any single company or centrally hosted system. By using a range of new hardware devices like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Leap Motion, PrioVR, Sixsense, and depth cameras, the experience of exploring these worlds can be incredibly immersive and the interaction with others lifelike and emotional.<p>We are looking for software engineers with solid experience in C++ and Javascript to help us build the Metaverse.
