We currently have clients in South Africa, Singapore and Ireland. We aim to delight customers with how simple we make payroll.<p>The role will be mostly back-end focused, with PostgreSQL as database. But some front-end skills will be a plus. Web development outside of Rails is also welcome, as long as you&#x27;re happy to convert.<p>The most important part of the interview is an object oriented design exercise, which is also a test of problem-solving skills.<p>Visas: We may be able to assist with visas for foreign candidates.  However, the South African government does not publish clear guidelines on experience required.  A comp sci degree will be a minimum requirement.  If you also have 3 years of software development experience it will greatly help your chances.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love living in Cape Town.<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za if you&#x27;re interested, putting &quot;Hacker News&quot; in the subject line.","time":1475510408,"type":"comment"}
