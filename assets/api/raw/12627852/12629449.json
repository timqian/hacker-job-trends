Our system is designed to handle user signups and photo uploads in real-time and deliver high-quality library sorting to users within minutes.  We also provide a Rails API that is consumed by the iOS and Android apps, and the the frame device itself.  Additionally, this team will help manage deployment infrastructure for our entire technology stack, which is hosted on AWS and includes a Rails app and multiple microservices.<p>We are also hiring experienced Android and iOS engineers who want to be lead engineers on our mobile apps. These apps provide a critical component of our user experience, as they are the only way to control the frame (which has no other inputs).  In addition to UI work, our Android and iOS apps include photo upload pipelines that are designed to rapidly upload photos to our backend storage for sorting by faces, etc and provide high quality results minutes after signup, even on lossy or bad data connections.  Ideal iOS and Android engineering candidates will also have experience and interest in building and maintaining our Rails API to support the features they build in the mobile apps.<p>Email jobs@auraframes.com if you&#x27;re interested. We have offices in NYC and SF, and will hire in either city. Relocation available.","time":1475515785,"type":"comment"}
