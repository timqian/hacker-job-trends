Our app features a cast of fun virtual characters that we’ve carefully created to improve your English fluency as quickly as possible. We’re building speech recognition that can understand heavy accents and that lets users actually have conversations in English—without needing a human partner.<p>We launched only a few months ago and users all around the world are already having over 50,000 conversations per week with our virtual characters. We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best investors in the world.<p>We’re looking for our first iOS&#x2F;Swift engineer to lead mobile development and eventually help grow and lead the team. We want to talk to you if you are a curious person, care about the details of a great user experience, and can build fast.<p>We’re currently a tiny team of 4 working out of a beautiful brick office in the SoMa district of San Francisco.
