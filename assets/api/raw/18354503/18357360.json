We want to create economic security for anyone who works for themselves. We offer an easy way for 1099 workers to apply for health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision coverage. We&#x27;re also expanding to other spaces like tax, so as to make it financially accessible for anybody who juggles multiple gigs, or is just pursuing a dream on their own.<p>As a business, we sit on a unique position and have partnerships with a ton of giant companies who want to better serve their workforce.
