We have over 75 million US users and are a true mission-oriented business, a rare case where our incentives are aligned with our users - we succeed by helping our members attain financial progress.<p>We&#x27;ve been growing rapidly over the past few years (hypergrowth) and are hiring across a wide range of positions. On the backend side, we are moving to Scala and Typescript node.js based microservices using finagle and Thrift, and as well as investing heavily in GraphQL. Our native iOS and Android apps are written in Swift and Kotlin and are the top apps in Finance. Our website is built in React + Redux.<p>We’re always on the lookout for experienced data scientists to help explore some of the richest data sets around and unlock financial insights for our members.<p>If you&#x27;re motivated by growth and impact Credit Karma is probably the best place to work in tech today. We have solved product &#x2F; market fit and distribution, but compared to our peer unicorns there is still so much work to do. If you look at the gap between our product today and what we are well-positioned to become - the main touchpoint for consumer finance - there is tons of opportunity for people joining now to take on responsibility and ownership and have a meaningful impact.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creditkarma.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creditkarma.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1514913512,"type":"comment"}
