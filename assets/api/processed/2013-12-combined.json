At Layer, we’re on a mission to deliver it. We’re hiring iOS, Android, backend, Web and systems engineers, as well as designers.<p>We have problems to solve that you’ll have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Here’s why:<p>We’re building our own network.  We need fine-grained control over latency and geographic distribution.  We’ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.<p>We’re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.<p>We’re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.<p>We’re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.<p>We care about documentation: <a href=\"https://layer.com/docs/ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layer.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ios</a>.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.<p>We care about design.  We won’t be releasing our own apps - that’s up to our customers - but we’ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.<p>We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don’t have the keys we can’t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)<p>Today we&#x27;re a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We’re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.<p>We’re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business. We’ve started and built world-class companies and highly scalable Internet infrastructure and invented protocols used by millions.<p>Get in touch: jobs at layer dot com","time":1385936240,"type":"comment"},{"by":"garyp","id":6844535,"parent":6827554,"text":"OnTheGo Platforms - Portland, OR - <a href=\"http://www.otgplatforms.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.otgplatforms.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;re a funded, early-stage startup developing software to make smart glasses easier to use and the applications on them more powerful.

The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.<p>Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.<p>FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.<p>SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.<p>We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.<p>When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.<p>At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!\nNote for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer.

Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.<p>Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.<p>DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper&#x2F;snail mail. We&#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.<p>--<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us with a new product&#x2F;revenue stream we&#x27;re going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We&#x27;re also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.<p>I&#x27;m Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2&#x2F;PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I&#x27;d like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don&#x27;t have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX&#x2F;UI is also a plus. We use Git and I&#x27;d expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.<p>You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don&#x27;t test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.<p>I do interviews similarly to the way they&#x27;re done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you&#x27;re looking for in a position I&#x27;d have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they&#x27;re interested in. I don&#x27;t do conference room whiteboard programming.<p>I don&#x27;t have a degree, and I don&#x27;t expect you to have one, either. I don&#x27;t necessarily care about how long you&#x27;ve been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems.

We use APIs to cross-connect our projects with ease, which also enables us to use different languages in different projects.\nFlexible work hours - come in as early or late as you want, as long as your total hours are on par with your peers; what really matters is the quality and quantity of your code commits.\nCode intelligently - We hack, but we also care about sharing code with each other, so we talk about readability and complexity, we develop all modules as though they&#x27;ll one day be open-sourced, and we believe in small tools used cleverly, at scale.\nOpen Source friendly-  Besides using mostly open-source tools, we&#x27;ve open-sourced several internally developed tools on <a href=\"https://github.com/MakerStudios/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MakerStudios&#x2F;</a>, and more are coming.\nGreat benefits - We have amazing investors and we want healthy, enthusiastic employees, so we offer our engineers a highly competitive salary, top-notch health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision coverage, 401(k), and stock options.<p>Inquiries:  geoffrey.plitt@makerstudios.com","time":1386011777,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":6834704,"parent":6827554,"time":1386002619,"type":"comment"},{"by":"zinxq","id":6833899,"kids":[6840440],"parent":6827554,"text":"Refresh - Mountain View, CA - Fulltime - <a href=\"http://www.refresh.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.refresh.io</a> email: jobs@refresh.io<p>Must be local or willing to relocate (paid)<p>A tagline of what we do is: Refresh helps connect people at a deeper level by providing realtime insights about them just as you&#x27;re about to meet them.\nThe best description however is found by simply installing the app (Iphone only at the moment - we&#x27;re in the app store, Android soon - see job description below!) and trying it yourself.<p>We&#x27;re super proud of the team we&#x27;ve built and we plan to keep the caliber high.\nWe have exactly one requirement for hiring an engineer - it&#x27;s someone we&#x27;d like to work with. That&#x27;s a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there&#x27;s a lot to it. It says that we think they&#x27;re smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they&#x27;re passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.<p>Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They&#x27;re largely modeled after Google interviews (there&#x27;s a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we&#x27;ve had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the &quot;getting the right answer&quot; not being the interesting part of the interview).<p>Specifically - We&#x27;re looking for:<p>Backend Developers:\nYou&#x27;re a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we&#x27;re building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we&#x27;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot.<p>Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you&#x27;re willing to learn. If you don&#x27;t know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.<p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they&#x27;re probably the only folks around who might get the intricacies of what you&#x27;re excited about)<p>We&#x27;re looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you&#x27;re a Senior Engineer - you&#x27;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You&#x27;ve scaled to thousands or millions of users. You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.<p>If you&#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you&#x27;re good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited. (New grads please apply!)<p>Android and IOS engineers:<p>You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience. You have a few years under your belt in either Objective-C or Android-Java.","time":1385995583,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jeffschenck","id":6830812,"parent":6827554,"text":"Chewse (www.chewse.com) - San Francisco, CA<p>FULL STACK ENGINEER<p><i>Who are you?</i><p>You love solving real problems with computers.
