Only traffic on the wire – whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments – reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence.

As soon as you apply you&#x27;ll get an email confirming that we got your application.<p>2. Someone reviews your application for some basic requirements (which are also listed on the application).<p>3. Next you&#x27;ll have a short interview with someone, likely our Director of Consulting. This won&#x27;t take more than 30 minutes.<p>4. After that we want to get some code to work on. We have a homework project you can use, or you can bring your own project as long as it includes Rails and React, or Node and React (depends on the position you&#x27;re applying for). And it needs to be on your machine and ready to work on, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll do together. If you use our homework, please timebox the task to no more than 2 hours.<p>5. Once you&#x27;ve got a project we can work on together, we&#x27;ll schedule 2 back-to-back interviews with our engineers. 1 engineer in each interview. This won&#x27;t take more than 90 minutes total.<p>6. After that, we review the feedback from the engineers, check your references, and extend an offer if we both agree it makes sense.<p>We hope you choose to apply.

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work &#x2F; personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>The work will include: Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK.<p>Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you&#x27;ve made, or an issue you&#x27;ve logged, no matter how small.

We have onsite classrooms in multiple continents and MU students are expected to do nothing but learn while in class, which means no day to day distractions like team meetings, emails and so forth.<p>For four weeks straight, five days a week, eight hours a day, we teach students how to create microservice applications with NodeJS, how to create front-end apps with React and Redux, and much more.  And if you are wondering what our curriculum currently looks like, the following is just some of the modern technologies that we teach:<p>JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, NodeJS, GraphQL, and Microservice Architecture<p>We are also always looking for new technologies and methodologies to teach, which will allow us to stay competitive and to attract&#x2F;retain talent.

There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us and new technologies and processes that will need to be invented, but the future looks bright for continuous learning.<p>In the future we can see employees not only negotiating for vacation days, but for education days as well.  What we are trying to do with MU is truly ambitious, but we need talented software engineers with an entrepreneurial spirit, that can speak with credibility, confidence and humility, to help us make this happen.  If you are the type of software engineer that sees problems as opportunities and can speak with confidence in-front of one or a hundred, we’d love to hear from you.<p>We know we are not in the same tech league as giants like Google or Amazon, but we can offer you an opportunity that they can’t.  What they can’t do is provide you with an opportunity to help redefine enterprise education and transform a global giant with close to one trillion dollars in assets.  By joining the MU team, you’ll have a once in a life-time opportunity to help pioneer a new way of learning and teaching in enterprise, that can redefine how we work in the future.<p>Waterloo<p>Senior:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.manulife.com&#x2F;ShowJob&#x2F;Id&#x2F;664619&#x2F;Senior-Software-Engineer-Engineering-Transformation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.manulife.com&#x2F;ShowJob&#x2F;Id&#x2F;664619&#x2F;Senior-Software-...</a><p>Montreal<p>Senior:   <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.manulife.com&#x2F;ShowJob&#x2F;Id&#x2F;489135&#x2F;Ing%C3%A9nieur-logiciel-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9raliste,-Transformation-de-l%E2%80%99ing%C3%A9nierie&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.manulife.com&#x2F;ShowJob&#x2F;Id&#x2F;489135&#x2F;Ing%C3%A9nieur-l...</a><p>Intermediate:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.manulife.com&#x2F;ShowJob&#x2F;Id&#x2F;489131&#x2F;Ing%C3%A9nieur-logiciel-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9raliste-principal,-Transformation-de-l%E2%80%99ing%C3%A9nierie&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.manulife.com&#x2F;ShowJob&#x2F;Id&#x2F;489131&#x2F;Ing%C3%A9nieur-l...</a>","time":1562010434,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rollsroyce","id":20334831,"parent":20325925,"text":"Level 12 | Full Stack Web Developer | REMOTE (US only) | www.level12.io<p>Level 12 has an opening for a full stack web developer, experienced mid-level or senior.

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions (in no particular order of preference):<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: I don&#x27;t find it acceptable if you would accept this as part-time job while keeping your full-time job.
