It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 57,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.

You’ll be working directly with me, @ssutch, to build out features that allow our users to purchase and sell bitcoin directly within the app. We believe this is the next most important step for breadwallet to truly achieve our vision of being the onramp for bitcoin.<p>The most important skillset for this job is React&#x2F;Redux. Candidates must have a firm understanding of how React&#x2F;Redux apps are built and must have worked on them in the past.

This provides an environment for us to develop quickly, while sandboxing the development from the underlying sensitive financial software.<p>Our HTML5 team is young, and so far it’s just been me with occasional help from some contractors. You’ll get the opportunity to shape how our HTML5 team evolves into the future.<p>Experience with iOS&#x2F;Swift and Android&#x2F;Java is definitely a bonus, but myself and our Android developer will assist there whenever necessary.

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients’ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several senior engineering positions (android, frontend, infra) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below).

We’re bringing much needed change to local high-volume delivery restaurants that are still doing delivery the way they’ve always done it.  We are backed by some of the best investors in the world, including Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, First Round Capital, SV Angel, and other amazing funds and individuals.<p>Zoomer connects high volume delivery restaurants with independent delivery drivers. Restaurants leveraging the Zoomer platform are able to provide a better &amp; more consistent delivery experience for their customer, which ultimately leads to a stronger bottom line. Independent drivers on the Zoomer platform have the ability to create their own schedule &amp; increase their own efficiency, resulting in more earnings.  And of course, customers receive their orders dramatically faster than the status quo.<p>We’re making key hires to expand our globally distributed core team.

Now it&#x27;s time to spread the word. We offer the equity, influence, and fun of an early-stage company, with stability, great pay, and a low-stress culture. We have great backers, strong traction, and an 11-digit target market. I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say this is my favorite so far.<p>Frontend Engineer: we earn our keep by giving users unprecedentedly fast and easy tools for exploring vast amounts of operational data. That starts with our unique backend query engine, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything without an equally amazing frontend. We&#x27;re building a brand-new web app that adds features while removing complexity, all with an eye to performance. As a ground-up rewrite, there&#x27;s lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>Integration Engineer: an ops visibility tool is only as good as the data it collects. We pride ourselves on collecting everything from logs to system metrics to application metrics to API data, in the whatever environment our customers are using. If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything. You&#x27;ll be playing around with software packages from Apache to Zookeeper, APIs from AWS to, er, Azure. Much of your work will involve adding modules to our Python-based agent. If you&#x27;re interested, there&#x27;s also room to help create dashboards and write guides to help engineers make sense of all the data that $PACKAGE_X generates.<p>DevOps Evangelist: if you&#x27;re passionate about enlightened server operations, appreciate good tools, and would like the chance to bring a great tool to great customers, we should talk.

The global supply chain is one the world&#x27;s largest economic engines, but it struggles to keep up with its own complexity.<p>The manufacturers, distributors, and retailers that make up this complex network are limited by the information they posses. They struggle to track and respond to supply and demand as their product travels from production to consumer. Those who try rely on 40-year-old data standards, lots of manual Excel work, and hordes of human middleware.<p>At Alloy, we’re set to change all this. We provide the first comprehensive, low-latency view of demand and inventory across all distribution channels. Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing companies to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand.<p>We are early stage, well funded by leading VCs, and growing. Our small team has diverse backgrounds and experience in analytics, large-scale enterprise software, and retail and financial technology. Culture really matters to us: we value diversity in all forms and strive to foster integrity, respect, and open communication.<p>We&#x27;re committed to make enterprise software inspiring.

The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Insanely fast-growing startup. We&#x27;re the fastest startup to reach a billion dollar valuation, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.<p>- Functional programming in F#.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 1 billion questions on our platform.<p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We’re hiring both Senior Engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as Junior Engineers who are just getting started. We’re looking for Junior Engineers who are eager to learn, who thrive on great mentorship, and who want to work on a mission that makes a difference. We’re looking for Senior Engineers who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.<p>You can learn more about what it’s like working here through Hardy’s on-boarding blog post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>.<p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p><pre><code>  [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\n  [2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\n  [3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\n  [4] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</code></pre>","time":1470087697,"type":"comment"},{"by":"evan121","id":12205201,"parent":12202865,"text":"Brightcove (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brightcove.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brightcove.com</a>) | London, Boston, Seattle, &amp; Tempe | Full-Time | Onsite<p>We&#x27;re an online video platform (OVP) headquartered near Boston&#x27;s South Station (with offices around the world), and power video for many of the world&#x27;s\nlargest media companies.
