It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 60,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is helping to tackle climate change.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have <i>many</i> established offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>Presently we&#x27;re hiring engineers in Atlanta, Beaverton, Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Dublin, London, New York, Palo Alto, Paris, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle, Sydney, Toronto and Washington DC.

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth.  We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought (well, subject to regulatory approval) by Walmart for 3.3 billion.  With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding.  And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life.

We have access to a cluster of hundreds of very powerful Linux machines to serve data, run simulations and provide a plethora of analytics to clients both internal and external.<p>⁃ Maintaining the Bloomberg Asset Backed Security database - includes writing cashflow models for thousands of securities and ingesting data from dozens of ‘trustee’ websites.<p>⁃ UI overhaul - as we migrate to the new infrastructure we are also rewriting the entire suite of Bloomberg Functions available through the Bloomberg Terminal.<p>Why us?<p>⁃ Bloomberg is one of the best places to work if you have any interest in financial technology<p>⁃ The Asset-backed Security industry went through a radical transformation since the sub-prime crisis (highly recommend reading The Big Short). Most firms now demand clean and accurate data and there are a very few places in the world that can deliver solutions at the same scale as us.<p>⁃ The Structured Product team is a really fun place to be in. We are a bunch of people who really enjoy working with each other and we greatly value hard-work and innovation.<p>Note that I represent just one group at Bloomberg. There are tons of other opportunities available and I’m willing to help you search for the right spot in the company.
