Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation. We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry.

Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 50,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 95 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.

Our customers love us, our investors love us, and we’re looking to hire.\nWe have offices in SF, DC, North Carolina, London, and now Sweden!<p>What we’re looking for (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi</a>):<p>Specifically we need:\n-A Data Engineer (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;c2f85048-55da-49c9-9c0c-c46babce40ec?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;c2f85048-55da-49c9-9c0c...</a>)<p>-DevOps - System Admin (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;e7f0ede3-647b-4282-bf07-a59d33c839d1?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;e7f0ede3-647b-4282-bf07...</a>)<p>- DevOps - System Engineering (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;b4c90b41-7d35-451e-858a-0bedaac184c0?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;b4c90b41-7d35-451e-858a...</a>)<p>-Customer Success Managers (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;4d09d09d-d68a-478d-8bbe-dbc679e49ea9?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;4d09d09d-d68a-478d-8bbe...</a>)<p>-Support Engineers (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;29f2ad17-fccd-4caa-95ad-f8b2f261573b?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;29f2ad17-fccd-4caa-95ad...</a>)<p>- Front End Engineer (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;6e54a1b2-7192-49c3-be82-53e28e730e4f?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;6e54a1b2-7192-49c3-be82...</a>)<p>- Senior Learning and Development Manager (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;a3d0b123-ca99-476c-ba4c-de063a9319b2?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;a3d0b123-ca99-476c-ba4c...</a>)<p>- Web developer (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;4bf2ca97-8252-426c-ace8-9e25c7c466c5?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;distilnetworks&#x2F;4bf2ca97-8252-426c-ace8...</a>)<p>We’re also hiring for Marketing, Recruiting, Finance, and Sales!

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We can provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ skill: your colleagues would say you get things done to a high standard. You know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.<p>Speaking of process, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: React, iOS, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and Kaizen weeks for self-improvement and experimentation.

Complex cross fades, card flips and other Android animation details are something you love working on because it can help you execute the perfect user experience.<p>You stay up-to-date on the Android platform and can provide insightful advice about leveraging native platform APIs or evaluating and leveraging wrappers.<p>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea.

We can&#x27;t understand what is happening to our oceans and climate without it. However, while obtaining precision ocean data is very tough, it is only a small part of the puzzle. Storing, visualizing and distributing the data to scientists and customers, in a form that they can manage, understand and manipulate, is a gargantuan task. A task that the ocean community has not yet been able to fully solve. At Saildrone, we intend to solve that problem and are looking for a transformational individual to spearhead that challenge.<p>Our fleet of Saildrones collect data at a rate, precision and price point that was previously impossible. With NOAA approved data precision and demonstrated reliability, we are now growing our fleet of autonomous vehicles from tens to hundreds, hence need a data architecture that can meet the demand. Challenges range from simply collecting and storing that data in reliable and secure repositories, to visualization and sophisticated augmentation of that data with third party data sets and satellite oceanography, all without compromising precision and always maintaining instant access to raw data. Regularly changing payloads, with different parameters and constantly varying sampling frequencies, give unique challenges to even the latest data storage solutions.<p>Saildrone is searching for more than a &#x27;software engineer with data skills&#x27;. We need a &#x27;Data Jedi&#x27; with deep knowledge of the software systems that create, store and distribute our data, coupled with an understanding of the challenges ahead as we create the richest and most advanced ocean data set on the planet.<p>INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING LEAD<p>Our Saildrone vehicles operate in one of the harshest environments on the planet, sending back consistent, high quality data, on extreme duration missions. While each Saildrone vehicle is incredibly robust, we also need a back-end and server-side infrastructure that is equally robust to support our drone network and data repositories.<p>At Saildrone, we are looking for an energetic and dynamic engineer to lead the ongoing creation and maintenance of our technical infrastructure. Responsibilities will range from network and tech-ops at our shoreside headquarters, to managing our cloud based networks and data repositories. Technical challenges range from optimizing performance and reliability to enabling rapid scalability. Ideal candidates would also have some experience at sys-admin level on embedded Linux hardware. This role requires both a strong technical mindset to solve complex problems as well as the people skills to grow and develop the team.","time":1456851269,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":11203969,"parent":11202954,"time":1456851161,"type":"comment"},{"by":"caitlinspothero","id":11203603,"parent":11202954,"text":"SpotHero | Chicago, IL | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spothero.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spothero.com</a>\nSpotHero is changing parking, and our tools will redefine the transportation industry.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else.

You want to be able to just build your application, use the APIs that will help that application gain traction, and at the same time save you money. But what happens when you want to switch APIs? You need to remove all of the dependencies, recode your application, then re-deploy it to your servers. And if you have an iOS application, you have to go through Apple’s cumbersome approval process.<p>Brightwork takes the pain out of APIs and removes that leap of faith. With Brightwork you can now turn up a stack in minutes, see all of your APIs’ performance and usage data information, and swap an API without the need to recode your application. We are unifying APIs to save Developers time and money. A lot of time. And a lot of money.<p>If you&#x27;re passionate about APIs we want to hear from you. We&#x27;re looking for someone that can come in and help with some technical heavy lifting. In exchange for your services you&#x27;ll get real world exposure to building an enterprise class platform for some of the biggest brands and companies.<p>Please note, this is an unpaid internship.
