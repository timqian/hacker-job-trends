Some key challenges: cross platform SDKs, making excellent forward compatible APIs, combining great UX with high customizability, and scaling up to millions of concurrent requests.<p>We&#x27;re particularly looking for true full stack engineers who can work on both the frontend and the backend. Sure, everybody has a sweet spot, but we&#x27;re not currently looking for &quot;true backenders&quot; or &quot;mobile devs&quot; or something like that. No need to already know all of our stack if you&#x27;re a fast learner. Bonus points if you&#x27;re good at keeping things simple!<p>CONTENT MARKETER &#x2F; WRITER:<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who a knack for tech who loves writing stories about how people use chat to make their lives and&#x2F;or their apps better. Bonus points if you&#x27;re good at happy customers or at SEO.<p>ABOUT YOU<p>Our team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don&#x27;t apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don&#x27;t apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.<p>We&#x27;re a semi-distributed team and we work primarily online (like a fully distributed team).

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (and 90 of the 100 biggest districts) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.

If you’re a small business (think bike shop, book store, physical therapist, flower stand, pet store, … ) owner, inventory-buyer, accountant, etc, your answer probably would have been: Yesterday. Tomorrow. Every day. B2B commerce is rapidly catching up with consumer commerce — it’s moving online — but the payments infrastructure for invoicing hasn’t. Rumbleship solves this.<p>What We Believe\nWe believe that B2B tools should be as clean, clear, and usable as consumer tools, and we believe that the best way to build this is to have a team from all walks of life.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures.

With over 60 million registered users, Academia is rapidly transforming the way researchers share their work.  We’re a small team of 25 people, passionate about building great software to open up science.  In 2016, we raised $11 million to fuel the growth of the platform and the team.<p>The present model for publishing academic papers is called the prestige model.  In this model, academic journals recruit professors to publish in their journal.  The paper is peer reviewed by 2 or 3 people, and then published.  This process takes 2-3 years (which is about how long it took 120-years ago).  The paper is then made available behind a paywall, and is accessible for $50-$100.  In this model, an average citizen would need to spend thousands of dollars in order to learn the latest research on any topic.<p>Academia’s mission is to democratize academic publishing, making academic papers available and accessible to anyone (not just academic elites), anywhere, on any device, in any language, for free.<p>The problem with the prestige model is several fold: the paper is reviewed by only 2 or 3 people, which isn’t a strong quality signal in today’s world.  Only a few people (100s) actually read papers published in journals, whereas in Academia’s platform, some papers get thousands of readers.  In Academia’s platform, papers get &gt;69% more citations.  And, in Academia’s platform publishing model, the papers are free, accessible to anyone.  <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0148257\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal....</a><p>As a result of Academia’s disruptive movement into Academic publishing, we’ve become the world’s largest distributor of academic papers.  In addition to our over 60M registered users, we now have over 6.5M monthly actives, and over 30M unique visitors every month.<p>With the release of our Premium product, we’ve gone cash flow positive; i.e. we’re generating more cash than we’re spending.  When our investors heard about this news, they put more money into our company (an influx of $11M in the last year).  We now have enough cash to move out of our single-threaded development model; we’re deepening our free offering, and widening our revenue producing products and features.  As a result, our valuation has grown substantially.<p>Due to our cash flow positive results and these recent investments, we’ve decided to grow our company.  We’re 25 employees, with 17 in engineering.  We expect to double in size during the next year, so there are many interesting, exciting, and provoking technical and business challenges at our company.\nWe’re located 2+ blocks from Montgomery BART in downtown San Francisco.<p>We’re a Ruby on Rails shop, with React on the frontend.  All of our engineers are full stack, and virtually all of them are computer scientists.  We value and recruit computer science generalists at Academia.  All of our development teams are product engineering teams.  Our teams consist of 1 PM, 1 Designer and 2-4 engineers.<p>Why don’t you ping me?

Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

Linux experience is preferred, and the ideal person would be able to develop on and for both Linux and Windows, but if you have no experience with one of the two that is fine as well. About half the team uses Linux for development and the other half uses Windows.<p>Personally speaking, I have a lot of fun at work because we work on so many different types of technologies all the way from a C# service to arcane areas of Linux APIs. Another thing I like is we have no standard platform for development, so I Vim and Linux for all of my work (if you want to become our first developer primarily on OSX that&#x27;s fine with us :P).<p>If you are interested, please email your resume to me at cortanasdkresumes@microsoft.com and a short 1-3 sentences that indicate you read the post.

As such, we&#x27;re growing our team to tackle the challenges ahead.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 8, located at London&#x27;s South Bank and value continuous learning, empathy with our clients and customers, and empowering our engineers to make the best decisions.<p># Front-End Engineer<p>This is for someone who:<p><pre><code>  - is comfortable in functional programming, especially Elm; and\n  - is experienced shipping front-end software to production; and\n  - has empathy for users and loves friendly UX; and\n  - has an eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge.\n</code></pre>\n## A Typical Day<p><pre><code>  - Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.\n  - After lunch you&#x27;re requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally introduced a couple weeks back. There&#x27;s no blame, instead some discussion about how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.\n  - The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You&#x27;re helping them sketch out a realistic wire-frame for a feature we plan to deliver in a couple of weeks.\n</code></pre>\n# Dev-Ops Engineer<p>We&#x27;re believers in CI and automated testing, but we need some help getting there. In particular we spend far too much time:<p><pre><code>  - Ensuring our testing, deployment, and validation services are up to date with the product.\n  - Managing different servers for staging and production.\n  - Trying to ensure we have a consistent build process across different machines.\n  - Thinking about the best way to deliver our machine-learning services in production.\n</code></pre>\nYou should have:<p><pre><code>  - experience maintaining CI services;\n  - experience writing web applications in a functional language;\n  - experience with different build processes (e.g. Make, `webpack`);\n  - knowledge of and comfortability with Linux, AWS, and Docker.\n</code></pre>\n# Benefits<p><pre><code>  - £50-70k DOE. + Equity.\n  - 20+ holidays per year.\n  - Support for conferences &amp; other tech related education.\n  - Friendly, supportive team.\n  - Great office location.\n</code></pre>\n# Some Tech we like:<p>We&#x27;re more interested in a willingness and ability to learn than what you currently know. But in case your interested in the stack we&#x27;re using:<p><pre><code>  - Haskell\n  - Elm\n  - PostgreSQL\n  - Python &#x2F; scikit-learn\n  - Tensorflow &#x2F; Deep learning\n  - AWS\n  - CircleCI\n  - Automated Testing\n</code></pre>\nWe aren&#x27;t looking for any particular level of experience, just great engineers and friendly people.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.<p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-hiring-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-h...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>","time":1525193824,"type":"comment"},{"by":"alasano","id":16968574,"parent":16967543,"text":"Coveo | Security Analyst | Montreal &amp; Quebec City, Canada | Full-time, ONSITE<p>Are you fearless ?

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
