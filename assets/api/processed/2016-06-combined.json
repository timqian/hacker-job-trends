Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.

This is your opportunity to get involved in a dynamic San Francisco-based startup with major growth potential.<p>Kentik Technolgies is a venture-backed startup based in San Francisco focused on network traffic analytics.  Our SaaS platform is upending legacy software and appliance-based vendors, going way beyond what they&#x27;re capable of in terms of scale, query speed, data granularity, and flexibility.  In our first 12 months selling, we&#x27;ve closed an incredible list of the world&#x27;s largest network operators, including  telcos, international carriers, hosting providers, and online enterprises like Pandora, Spotify, Box, Yelp, Shopify, Neustar, and Cisco &#x2F; OpenDNS.  We&#x27;re on track for 5x revenue growth this year.<p>Accessible via portal, psql client, and API, Kentik Detect is the network visibility solution that our founders — former network operators from Akamai, Netflix, YouTube, and CloudFlare — always wanted but could never find. It lets network operators see complete traffic paths, find root causes for link congestion, reduce costs by peering with other networks, and know immediately when their networks are under DDoS attack. And with your help we can keep making it even better.<p>On the backend we&#x27;re looking for folks with real-world experience building distributed systems in Go&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++. On the front end we need experts at both client- and server-side JavaScript, with broad experience in monitoring, visualization, and building state-of-the-art Web applications. And in sales we need proven performers with a track record in highly technical markets (network-related preferred).<p>Sound like a good fit?

Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing companies to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand.<p>We are early stage, well funded by leading VCs, and growing.

We have chefs on staff that cook amazing lunches we all enjoy family-style every day. Continuous improvement is baked into the company DNA, and can be seen just as well on the warehouse floor as in the engineering teams. Our interview process is short and transparent: a phone screen, a technical phone interview, and an onsite. The whole process could take &lt; 1 week. Low stress, very collaborative and conversational, not algorithms at a whiteboard.<p># Senior DevOps Engineer | Onsite or Remote<p>The Delivery Engineering team supports the culture of DevOps at Good Eggs. We build shared tools and services that enable every team to deploy, monitor, and maintain their own production environments. The work we do helps our peers move faster, deliver more, and break less. We&#x27;re software engineers with a soft spot for operations, automation, and the libraries that help us build applications.<p>You&#x27;ll report to me, and have ground-floor influence over technical decisions and roadmap. This is a senior role -- you should be a strong software engineer and have &gt; 5 years of relevant experience to draw from. We&#x27;re currently building a bespoke PaaS using the latest tech like Docker, Amazon ECS, Kubernetes, CoreOS, etc. Our philosophy is open source by default, and we&#x27;re coding mostly in Node and Go.<p># Senior Software Engineer | Onsite<p>If you are a full-stack web developer or have significant experience building e-commerce and logistics systems and want to apply your talents to building a better food system, we’d love to hear from you.<p>We run a mature Agile engineering process complete with test-driven development, pair programming and continuous deployment of features throughout the day. We’re building next-generation web and mobile applications with JavaScript across the stack, including Node, Mongo, React, Angular, and a wealth of other tools from the rapidly-evolving JavaScript ecosystem. We are happy to train the right person to work in this environment.<p># Principal Software Engineer | Onsite<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers who are interested in a multidisciplinary engineering environment, and who are excited by building high-scale software that interfaces with every aspect of Good Eggs, including website ordering, operations, and customer service. Our team is a great opportunity to widen your perspective of what it takes to make a large just-in-time commerce and logistics company tick.<p>We run a mature Agile engineering process complete with test-driven development, pair programming and continuous deployment of features throughout the day. Our core platform is built on Node, Mongo, React, and Angular.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project.

We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our next trip is January 2017...hello southern hemisphere!<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

We try to observe and study these concepts in real world data (such as international trade data), and ask related questions: Does this hold true at the within-country level? Can we observe knowhow developing in a location over time? Is it possible to grow a new capabilities and industries in a country out of nowhere?

It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game.
