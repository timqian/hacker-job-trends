While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house).

Walmart&#x27;s mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success. We started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contributing back to the clojure &amp; open source community\n</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data\n</code></pre>\nFor a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk I gave at Clojure&#x2F;West. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4</a>.<p>Does this sound like something you&#x27;re into?

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (17M kids), and 39,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 70 (30 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.<p>We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. We are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations, and capital markets.We want passionate, fun-loving people who can contribute positively to our company and our culture.

When developing we focus on mobile-first and progressive enhancement, and we strive to offer an enjoyable experience to all our users, regardless of what device and platform they are using. We operate mainly in the European and the Asian markets, with all the challenges that include, for example: different alphabets, different levels of literacy among our users, and different experience levels with internet usage and technology.<p>Our implementation \nWe use Java a lot.

We try to keep the code-base to a minimum. On the frontend we use plain JavaScript (inline) for code that has to be executed right away, and jQuery for “nice to have” functionality. We use Apache Velocity for templating. We build using Maven and Grunt, and we track our code using Git. Performance is key, and our aim is that our applications should be ready to use (or at least be perceived as being ready to use) within a second, even on slow connections. \nWe have (big) databases too, but you won’t have to interact with them directly.

We’ve had to turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network.<p>As we scale, we’ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates don’t receive unsolicited outreach from recruiters and companies don’t pay placement fees for the vast majority of their hires.

We&#x27;ve been around since 2009 and we have about 260 employees.<p>Our security group is split into two teams - Security Operations and Security Governance. SecOps builds security software and features for our customers and employees (like two-factor authentication) and Security Governance performs security assessments on our existing and pre-release software. You would be joining me on the Security Governance team, doing web and mobile penetration tests, source code review and incident response.<p>In this role, you&#x27;ll be working through different parts of our frontend, backend and internal software and breaking it any and every way you can. You&#x27;ll be working closely with the software engineering teams as a resident security authority. You&#x27;ll also be checking IDS logs and working with tools like ThreatStack, CrowdStrike, Suricata, etc. Prior experience with those exact tools is helpful but not necessary, we&#x27;ll get you up to speed regardless. More important is the ability to find real security flaws in applications and spot problems with source code.<p>This is an ideal job for those who are technically competent and tired of working as a security consultant (however, you do not need to have been a consultant, we will consider virtually any background as long as you have solid skills).<p>Some report writing will be required for you to document and track vulnerabilities, but you will not be using pages and pages of methodology or vulnerability diagram boilerplate. Most reports are about a page with a much simpler template, and posted right to GitHub. You&#x27;ll be doing more direct communication with engineers via IRC or Zoom about vulnerabilities you find than you will be writing a report about it.<p>Speaking of GitHub, we use it for everything. Even our HR and marketing teams use GitHub. We are a very engineering-heavy organization. We also offer a lot of support for remote employees - I work fully remote from NYC. We use a private IRC server and Slack for chat, Zoom for video conferencing and we even have two Double Robotics robots in our office to remote into.<p>Finally, our tech stack consists of mostly Scala and Java on the backend and mostly JavaScript and Ruby on the frontend. We also use Python, R, Clojure and C for certain tools. People are free to write in whatever they want as long as it&#x27;s effective.

We develop and sell high-quality software solutions to consumers and businesses, solving tricky problems in (largely) niche domains elegantly and effectively.<p>We are currently looking for a number of business-minded individuals, developers, writers, and more to help us take everything to the next level.<p>* Full-time business developer direly needed. We have software solutions businesses are tripping over themselves to buy and other solutions that can reduce the operating expenses of some businesses ten-fold but we don&#x27;t know how to sell. If you have what it takes to reach out to these companies and bring them in, if you want to help us take our software to the next level and sell it the way it deserves to be sold, we want you. Previous experience in the B2B market (esp. with contacts) is a huge bonus.<p>* AdWords (and&#x2F;or other online advertising) expert? We&#x27;ve heard that ads are a dying business, but we don&#x27;t buy it. If you know how to craft the right AdWords ads and bid for the right spots to drive good customers to a software business in the backup&#x2F;recovery sector, look no further. Our developers and engineers have done their best but have ultimately failed to come up with an ad strategy on Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;twitter that doesn&#x27;t cost us an order of magnitude more than what it brings in. We admit failure, but we&#x27;re not giving up. If you have experience in this field, please get in touch! We&#x27;re selling real products that solve real problems and bring in real money (while saving our customers a ton in the process), but we need your help to make it happen!<p>* HTML&#x2F;CSS developers wanted to modernize our existing site and create a mobile-friendly browsing experience for our users. If you have a talent for creating stunning landing pages or lightweight, snappy, and compatible websites - we want you! We&#x27;re not interested in bloat and form over function; our websites follow our own software&#x27;s mantra: sweet and simple. Our site is largely ASP.NET&#x2F;C#, landing pages are pure HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. ASP.NET experience is not a must, but comes in handy to better-understand the templating.<p>* We are looking for desktop C# developers that can make a good-looking and intuitive product to join our time and expand our repertoire of award-winning, world-class software. Most of our products are system-level utilities, previous experience developing commercial Windows software solutions is recommended. You&#x27;ll largely be responsible for small utilities and applications yourself.<p>* Are you a tech-savvy creative writer, who loves to experiment with software and explore new things? We are looking for writers and bloggers to expand our collection of guides, tutorials, and reviews! Windows and Mac experts are welcome; we are also highly-interested in doing new things in new and novel ways so if you have a penchant for something special (say, video reviews), introduce yourself. Experience with beta software and the courage to brave new versions of operating systems and experiment with the latest and greatest technology is a must. If this is you, please get in touch - we want to talk!<p>* Technical writers with experience in Windows and preferably also Linux&#x2F;BSD that know their way around virtual machines - please get in touch! We want to expand our user manuals and our documentation for our technical support staff with state-of-the-art and up-to-date documentation. Help us make our users and our staff happy, and find potential for improvements while you&#x27;re at it.<p>* IT experts with a knack for writing - we want to expand our online knowledgeable with more issues, better solutions, clearer instructions, and proper, vetted knowledge. Do you love researching? Have a penchant for QA work but want to apply it in novel and interesting ways? Help us document gotchas and find real (not folklore&#x2F;he-said-she-said) fixes for Windows, Mac, and Linux errors to help make solving these problems easier for everyone out there.<p>You probably have an idea of what we do from the few paragraphs above.

In the tech industry, we have been on the receiving end of some killer productivity apps. Some of our favorites include Asana, Yammer and Slack. These apps have completely changed the way we work… unless you’re part of the half of the economy that doesn’t sit at a desk. Try using these apps 100% of the time on a mobile device and you’ll likely grow frustrated. Worse yet, these apps were imagined using the use cases of product managers and engineers, not bartenders, hotel workers, contractors or similar jobs. The existing apps are just too hard to use and fundamentally miss on solving the problems workers in these industries face.<p>Crew tries to take what we’ve learned about productivity for desk-bound workers and make that more compatible for other industries. Crew currently consists of multiple “modules”: Messaging — Before using Crew, many of our users were using a mix of text messages and emails, with some using consumer messaging apps like WhatsApp and GroupMe. Crew makes messaging much easier by allowing a manager to add employees to a central directory, enabling employees to communicate without trading phone numbers (both a convenience and actually a safety concern in some companies). Scheduling — Coordination around shifts is one of the top concerns in the businesses of many of our customers. Employees have shift schedules which can vary from week to week and employers get burned when shifts are busted (no-shows). Crew makes it easy to post the shift schedule and then coordinate shift swapping when necessary. Task Management — Did you know that many restaurants have a “chore board” in the back? An actual chalkboard or piece of paper posted letting everyone know what has to get done today. Tasks replaces the chore board with a ticketing system.<p>We have new modules currently under development but what we’ve released thus far has already received a warm reception. Despite only having been available since April, Crew is growing very fast and is frequently ranked in the top 100 Business apps on both Google Play and iTunes. The traction we’ve gotten has helped us raise a seed round. Our backend is a highly automated deployment in EC2 that utilizes auto scaling along with many AWS features. Currently our client consist of an iOS, Android and Webapp utilizing a common infrastructure to communicate. The communication and data infrastructure is written in Node.js and Java (Spring) with heavy reliance on Mongo, Redis and ActiveMQ. This stack allows us to meet our goal of having a linear scalable application that targets zero downtime. The webapp is a Node.js Express application that utilizes Backbone, Require.js and Bootstrap to deliver a responsive and highly performant experience.","time":1438614662,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":9998176,"parent":9996333,"time":1438623923,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":10016230,"parent":9996333,"time":1438867926,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dalys","id":10008692,"parent":9996333,"text":"Senior Platform Engineer + VP Engineering&#x2F;CTO, to Lifesum - Stockholm, Sweden, Europe - Full-time &#x2F; ONSITE<p>This text is for Senior Platform Engineer role.

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly.\nAs an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ <i>skill</i>: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ <i>desire to learn</i>: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ <i>understanding</i>: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ <i>clear communication</i>: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.\nSpeaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.\nSo, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia this fall...want to join us?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).
