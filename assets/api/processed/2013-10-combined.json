In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80&#x2F;20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<p>Go international. We&#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&amp;B numbers and such.<p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were &quot;non-consumers&quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven&#x27;t been eating someone else&#x27;s lunch, we&#x27;ve created a whole new category! Now it&#x27;s time to move up to bigger merchants.<p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href=\"http://squareup.com/market\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;squareup.com&#x2F;market</a>) and Square Cash (<a href=\"http://squareup.com/cash\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;squareup.com&#x2F;cash</a>), we&#x27;re going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We&#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<p>Data as product. We&#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<p>In NYC, we&#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We&#x27;re a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<p>If you&#x27;re interested; I&#x27;d love to chat.

Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users’ screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio&#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding.

Even if your recent roles have taken you away from being as hands-on as you might like, you&#x27;ve no doubt found other ways to keep your coding skills from getting too rusty and we expect that you&#x27;ll have had exposure to recent technologies. \n- You have a rich breadth of experience and are equally comfortable talking financial projections or business process modelling as you are advocating for TDD.\n- You really understand the business context of the challenges that organisations face and distinguish yourself in the way you articulate this with clients to create and deliver robust, scalable, elegant, flexible and relevant software solutions that truly transform industries.\n- Leadership is not something you do from far away, you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.<p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here’s what you can do:<p>- Directly guide the technical strategy for one of the world’s largest airlines.

Get published.<p>There&#x27;s no typical day or engagement for our Principal Consultants. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organisational review, helping them to understand the potential that technology has to solve their most pressing problems.

It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you&#x27;re equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution. Whatever your role the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue building software without undue pressure. You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.<p>You recognise that building your network is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role - and you appreciate that it might be tough initially to find your place in our incredibly flat-structured organisation.

Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio&#x2F;video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users’ screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio&#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources &amp; only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isn’t feasible for video conferencing.<p>AngelList Profile: <a href=\"http://angel.co/showkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;showkit</a> ShowKit<p>Demo Videos: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;ShowKitSDK</a><p>Our Office &amp; Perks:<p>Our Penthouse office sits on the historic Sunset Strip with the best view of all of LA. - Top of the line gear - Kitchen stocked full of drinks and snacks - Friendly and down-to-earth work environment - Health, Dental &amp; Vision Coverage","time":1381176335,"type":"comment"},{"by":"madebymode","id":6489337,"parent":6475879,"text":"MODE – Interactive Developer – Charlotte, NC<p>MODE, a branding &amp; interactive agency, is seeking an mid-to-senior-level interactive developer with an excellent command of current web technologies and a thirst to learn more to join our growing interactive team.<p>Our needs focus on advanced PHP &amp; MySQL development, with front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, responsive design) experience and&#x2F;or the desire to learn.

The current system supports over 70 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy.
