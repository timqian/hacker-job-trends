We think about online learning in a vertically integrated way, from the actual learning content and the product all the way to job preparation. Students with no programming and just high school math backgrounds have gone from 0 to job ready and have gotten jobs at companies like SpaceX, and our NPS is around 60.<p>We don&#x27;t believe in skimming the surface of concepts so that students just know what to type. We build intuition around complicated ideas like random forests from the ground up. We walk students through building their own algorithms, so we can help them understand the tradeoffs and limitations of techniques. We help students build projects, so they can solidify their knowledge and get real-world experience.<p>While so far we&#x27;ve mostly focused on teaching data science through Python, we&#x27;re looking for someone to help us extend and enhance our R content. This involves writing instructional content, creating projects, thinking about how to improve how we teach, mentoring students directly, and getting feedback from students to improve our teaching methods. If you have:<p>- experience writing R code (whether on the job or your own packages)<p>- experience writing technical data science content<p>- a strong a data science foundation<p>- a deep interest in teaching<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who shares our mission of giving people access to high quality education at a low cost. You&#x27;ll have a lot of latitude to shape how we teach, and to help build a personalized educational platform.

We are committed to providing a warm and comforting environment for people from all walks of life in Highrise.<p>As Lead Backend Developer, you&#x27;ll be the first non-founder engineer on the backend team. The role is highly independent and will be working closely with our cofounders on all things backend. We have a strong engineering culture with an extremely capable and experienced team. The entire Highrise mobile app was built single handedly by our CTO, with the entire server backend written by our VP Eng. We are looking for an engineer and developer of the same caliber to join our team to take Highrise to the next level.<p>The role is fast-paced and independent, with a focus on results rather than on direct oversight or management. The role will require learning new tools, languages, algorithms, techniques and much more. Our backend is modern and highly performant. The stack uses Kubernetes, JRuby, Scala, Akka, and MongoDB, so experience with any of these technologies is a plus. To support the next round of growth we plan to migrate the JRuby and Scala codebases to Java, and you will be the lead architect of this new Java backend. In short, this is the perfect role for a self-starting engineer who loves to solve challenging problems in a fast-paced environment.<p>More here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highrise-inc.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;513323\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highrise-inc.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;513323</a>","time":1499108550,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14689892,"parent":14688684,"time":1499102447,"type":"comment"},{"by":"eli","id":14689595,"parent":14688684,"text":"Industry Dive | Washington, DC | Full-Time Onsite<p><pre><code>    ++ MULTIPLE POSITIONS ++\n</code></pre>\n- Data Engineer &#x2F; Data Analyst - Manage development of our Airflow-based ETL &amp; data warehouse<p>- Python Developer - Our core app is in Django, but we also have Flask apps and a Python data ETL project<p>- DBA - Data modeling and database design.

We create enterprise mobile applications that are clean, well-tested, scalable and deployed in a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline.<p>WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR:<p>Ideal candidates have been working in the mobile space for a few years, have led a few mobile teams, can lead mobile strategy, and care about best practices like testing and continuous delivery. We are particularly interested in engineers with native iOS experience, especially Swift.<p>We have a strong preference for candidates with previous full stack development experience, as the nature of consulting means working on projects with a huge variety in scale, scope and technology. However, we are open to considering candidates without previous full stack experience if there is a strong desire to learn from our full stack developers, DevOps engineers, etc.<p>We work almost exclusively on client site providing a mix of delivery and consulting services, so you’ll travel extensively as part of your role.","time":1499196274,"type":"comment"},{"by":"bfe","id":14690522,"parent":14688684,"text":"<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x-r.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x-r.ai</a> | AI engineer | Portland, Oregon | Full-time | REMOTE | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x-r.ai&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x-r.ai&#x2F;careers</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x-r.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x-r.ai</a> is applying AI to accelerate technology development - initially by applying AI to accelerate patent attorney work to reduce the time and resources required to resolve patent disputes and to shut down patent trolls.<p>We are developing an AI-powered work platform for patent attorneys to do all their work on which will replace the inefficient decades-old software they currently use, and make their work dramatically faster, more efficient, and more thorough.  We have a handful of enterprise customers, who spend billion-dollar-scale per year on patents, in our private pro beta free trial, and they are getting rapidly more excited and asking us how quickly we can take more of their work and how soon we can expand coverage for their work in Europe and Asia.<p>We are targeting for x-r.ai to become the indispensable platform that all patent attorneys need to work competitively.  Under our anti-troll license, any non-practicing entity and their outside law firms, and anyone who sues a startup for patent infringement and their outside law firms, will be banned from using x-r.ai, while startups sued for patent infringement and their outside law firms can use x-r.ai pro for free.  Once we reach our target capabilities, it will be impossible for any patent attorney to work for a troll or for someone who sues a startup and ever be able to do their job cost-effectively again.<p>Help us revolutionize a giant market and lift a burden from the entire tech world by fixing patents with software.<p>I just started x-r.ai in April and we are still a very small team; all positions currently come with significant equity.  We&#x27;re based in beautiful, affordable Portland, Oregon and will also be doing in-person interviews in the Bay Area and Seattle&#x2F;Redmond regularly, including in SF, SV, and Berkeley before and after the Deep RL bootcamp at Berkeley in late August.  Work in-person in Portland at least occasionally is preferred, but we will evaluate case-by-case for the right people.  Successful applicants should show evidence of high levels of drive, intelligence, and team fit, and interesting machine learning applications they&#x27;ve developed.  So far our back-end is all python ML ecosystem but we&#x27;re starting to get into lua as well.

We are looking for someone to join our team as an HPC System Administrator.<p>The SRCC provides lots of services to the Stanford community (which includes non-Stanford researchers collaborating on Stanford research):  We maintain several large compute environments (like Sherlock—yes, the Sherlock mentioned recently on Silicon Valley) for various uses.  We offer consultation services, helping users get the most from our environments.  We offer workshops and training, on topics relevant to the HPC community.  We also offer architecture, sysadmin, and development services to labs.

We use Puppet in some places, and Rocks in others.  We use technologies (like Infiniband, Lustre, and GPFS) and software (like SLURM and MPI) that you may not have used before, and we also use stuff (like Linux, Git, Apache, Kerberos, and LDAP) that you likely have used before.<p>This position is on-site, on Stanford&#x27;s campus.

Everyone has had a manager that makes them want to call in sick. Everyone has had a manager who regularly forces their team to chase their own tail doing meaningless work.<p>Why? Because most managers manage their teams blindly. They don&#x27;t hire, coach and promote based on data. Instead, they make decisions based on their gut. These decisions are made because managers don’t have the data to make smarter, more informed decisions when it comes to managing.<p>Not anymore. At People.ai we’re helping managers make decisions about their team based on data, not intuition. We’re starting with sales teams because they’re a particularly notorious black box.
