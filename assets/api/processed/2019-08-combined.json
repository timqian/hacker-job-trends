We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience.

As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don’t accept that.<p>Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we’re working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.<p>Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others.

Simulations will be performed using ROS and programming will be with Python (C or Matlab may also be considered for some developmental steps, but the expertise with Python and ROS is critically important).<p>In the project you will collaborate with an experienced team of industrial experts and will be performing challenging research tasks leading to the implementation of advanced algorithms on software (Python), testing and validating the results in simulation (in ROS) and ultimately on laboratory scale mobile robots (unmanned ground based vehicles). The results will be integrated in systems with industrial significance and national importance.<p>You will be an expert in the area of mobile robotics, autonomous systems, control and navigation with interest to SLAM and decommissioning and keen to learn more about computer vision and transparent deep learning.<p>We are particularly interested in applicants who are excited by the potential of working at the interface between disciplines.<p>A PhD degree (or being in a process of submission of a PhD) or equivalent in Computer Science or Engineering or a closely-related field is required to be eligible for this position. You will have a track record of high-quality publications in the areas of relevance to the project and the willingness to undertake ambitious and challenging research.

At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.

You will own the end-to-end club experience, including processes to deliver high-quality mentorship to hundreds of club leaders worldwide, enabling Hack Club to scale beyond the number of calls our team can take in a week. If successful, this position will bring Hack Club from 2% of US high schools to becoming as ubiquitous and culturally foundational as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.<p>This role has C-level freedom, as well as responsibility. You will be tasked with solving the most challenging problems Hack Club faces as a rapidly growing student network. You must be able to work creatively and autonomously to design life-changing student experiences that you can simultaneously maintain and deliver to an ever-growing number of students.<p>Some examples of challenges to overcome:<p>- How do we build a diverse and representative community of student leaders and enable leaders to do the same within their clubs?<p>- How do we offer consistent value to students regardless of their financial background, making the club experience as powerful in Zimbabwe as it is in Cincinnati?<p>- How do we provide high-quality mentorship and coaching to a large body of student leaders, and bring students into the process of onboarding other clubs?<p>- How do we ensure that clubs survive the graduation of their leaders?<p>We need an obsessive, product-minded, operationally-excellent person with past experience growing direct-service programs and an intense focus on the student experience.<p>Interested?

It is our access to and deep understanding of these diverse communities that fuel our ability to make relevant investments.<p><i>History</i><p>IQT was established in 1999 to ensure that our country’s intelligence agencies had access to innovative technologies from the startup community to help protect and preserve our nation’s security. CIA leaders recognized that technological innovation had largely shifted from the purview of government R&amp;D and large organizations to entrepreneurs and the startup community who were developing much-needed technologies more quickly and less expensively, and continue to do so today.<p>As a not-for-profit strategic investor, IQT has connected visionary startups with a potent mix of support: financial resources in the form of strategic investments, market understanding, and engineering expertise to bring their technology to the intelligence community.

Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24&#x2F;7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...<p>But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t &quot;sudo cancel my Comcast subscription&quot; but you can &quot;magic cancel my Comcast subscription.&quot; It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.<p>Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.<p>ABOUT THE POSITION:<p>Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.<p>We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week.

We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.\n“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual&#x2F;human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.\nThe data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.\nThis time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.\nThere is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.<p>We&#x27;re looking for one more data engineer and&#x2F;or data scientist with strong programming python skills to join the team. We are super early so you’re getting in on the ground floor, but we are well funded (closed a large seed round recently from several top-tier VC’s in SF and NYC). We already have a large data set and a customer and are seeing early success with our initial model. Our office is in the middle of Manhattan.\nYou’d be working along side industry experts and researchers. We’re building a company culture taking the best engineering and cultural practices from Google and mixing in the freedom of working at a startup.\nYou can publish white papers and speak at conferences. We’re working closely with Google (TF + cloud teams) so you’ll also get access to that resource. You can use your favorite tools, including PyTorch and FastAI, and get access to powerful VM’s.\nIf you’re interested in the current position, or want to reach out and stay in touch for when we start hiring again, or want to collaborate because you’re working on a similar problem, connect with me on linkedin (mention hn&#x2F;yc) or email me: tomasv at deepfraud dot com.<p>Thanks all!<p>-Tom","time":1565468340,"type":"comment"},{"by":"loopycode","dead":true,"id":20584863,"parent":20584311,"text":"Ibm","time":1564674407,"type":"comment"},{"by":"egfx","id":20588445,"kids":[20589631,20589494],"parent":20584311,"text":"wouldn&#x27;t recommend working with this guy.\nI was an early consumer of the service and I gave him a great suggestion of simplifying the form to make it easier and he flipped out, cursed me and deleted my account.
