Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording &amp; Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search &amp; Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.<p>We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture.

Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.<p>- You&#x27;re annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user&#x27;s browsers. You&#x27;re painfully aware of the difference between &quot;DRY&quot; as an important guiding principle of software development, and &quot;DRY&quot; as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.<p>- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages&#x27; recent progress targeting WebAssembly.<p>- You nerd out about content-specific adaptive streaming and compression techniques.<p>- You think Observable notebooks are really cool.<p>- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.<p>- From a front-end perspective, you recognize the tension in the development feedback loop between client-side software and a back-end service ecosystem, and derive immense satisfaction from improving development processes to relieve those tensions.<p>- You&#x27;re intimately familiar with the lifecycle of software components - from experiment, to prototype, to an incremental release schedule.<p>- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.<p>Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language, and are still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack.

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: I wouldn&#x27;t find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because rest is important).","time":1567524171,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":20867355,"parent":20867123,"time":1567524000,"type":"comment"},{"by":"daynawu","dead":true,"id":20901118,"parent":20867123,"text":"Covariant (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;covariant.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;covariant.ai&#x2F;</a>) | Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer | Berkeley, CA (San Francisco Bay Area) | full-time | onsite | visa<p>At covariant.ai, innovation is at the core of our company.
