You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp;amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or AzureDevOps is a plus.

OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.<p>Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.<p>Read about our tech stack here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fulcrum.lever.co&#x2F;the-lever-tech-stack-1b30e27d2bb0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fulcrum.lever.co&#x2F;the-lever-tech-stack-1b30e27d2bb0</a>","time":1559590845,"type":"comment"},{"by":"perrylouniverse","id":20086670,"parent":20083795,"text":"Adacado | Intermediate and Senior Software Engineers, FE and BE | Vancouver, BC, Canada | Full-time, onsite<p>You have over 3-5 years of coding and web application expertise, and want to do more innovative development and less mundane operations support.<p>“Creating Change is what we do.”<p>Adacado is looking for expert FE and BE programmers (ES6&#x2F;CSS or Golang) to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically. You’re the type of developer that is never satisfied. You strive to create new technologies&#x2F;design patterns, and&#x2F;or completely abandoning current systems and undertaking complete re-builds, using all the latest technology. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.<p>“Fail often, fail fast.”<p>The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges. Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, Node and ES6, and utilizes Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch. We manage an ever growing army of microserviceswith special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.<p>As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing&#x2F;reviewing&#x2F;writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise. You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’. You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues. We value expert specialists over expert generalists.<p>The Adacado Team<p>Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit. We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.<p>We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development&#x2F;education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).<p>Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.<p>How to Apply<p>Please send your CV and cover letter to careers@adacado.com, and indicate you are applying from Hacker News.<p>www.adacado.com","time":1559587437,"type":"comment"},{"by":"samidalouche","id":20086563,"parent":20083795,"text":"Narrative I&#x2F;O | Scala Backend Engineer, Angular Frontend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrative.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrative.io&#x2F;</a><p>Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.

On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.
