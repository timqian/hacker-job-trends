The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients’ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider. We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, backend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team.

At Latchel we use technology to make our internal operations much more efficient, but develop to the level our customers&#x27; users are comfortable with. After only a two months of operation, we&#x27;re more than 3x more efficient than the industry standard for maintenance coordination.

A PoC of an early version of the idea was featured here on HN 3 years ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8069386\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8069386</a>. Time has passed since then and the idea, and technologies required for building it, have evolved. It is my belief the time for this idea, from a market-perspective, has arrived.<p>The service will be designed to improve the process of integrating a company&#x27;s API product with channel partners, either on-prem or in a hosted manner, with the intent to increase pass-through revenue on the API calls a company provides, while providing a simple federated layer based on blochchain backed data structures. This idea is in pre-funding, so I&#x27;m explicitly stating anyone interested in my idea should consider their founder-level involvement as purely self-choice driven. Influencing, making or removing choice for you in this regard is illogical and irrational, given the state of the company (non-existent) and funding (also non-existent). However, if you hold the view that the existing methods for securing the Internet&#x27;s infrastructure are woefully inadequate and you feel applying cryptocurrency to APIs could make companies more money by securing them against use by limiting calls with payments, then you should contact me and we should have a conversation about it.<p>Expertise in building scalable API calls with microservices-based architecture is desired, but a more general gift in development is also welcome. I code in Python, Javascript and C++, and am decently good at running infrastructure, given my history. My primary function is strategy, operations and architecture. I do not visualize, so I tend to communicate differently.<p>My email address is in my profile here on HN. Happy to just discuss the idea, if you are interested, as opposed to any expectation of finding someone this early on to join me.<p>If you&#x27;ve read this far, I appreciate you. I will note that this idea can be applied to AI in a less than obvious way. This reason is the primary purpose of the project, but making revenue in other ways first remains important.","time":1491242254,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dindresto","id":14025598,"parent":14023198,"text":"Alugha GmbH | Mannheim, Germany | Full-time, Onsite | Software \nEngineer<p>Email: nk@alugha.com<p>Alugha is a software startup, a multimedia agency and a multilingual video platform:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alugha.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alugha.com</a><p>Looking for developers that have experience with:<p>React, ES2015, GraphQL, Webpack 2 and Code Splitting<p>Drop me a mail for more information.","time":1491244019,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jacinda","id":14029639,"parent":14023198,"text":"Doctor On Demand | Multiple Engineering and Marketing Positions | SF | ONSITE and INTERN | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doctorondemand.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doctorondemand.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>People use our service to gain access to some of the best physicians and licensed therapists in the country, all whenever and wherever is most convenient.

We are a global liquidity provider and market maker, operating around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.<p>It’s no secret that we’re big believers in functional programming; OCaml, a statically typed functional language, is our primary development platform. Jane Street’s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it’s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We’re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code?

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else.

This job can be as hands-on as you like, and hopefully you like that! Also, this job requires creativity; not in the sense of “how dirty can we be and not get fined?” but in the sense of “nobody’s done this sort of thing before, how can we comply with both the letter and spirit of the regulations without a clear precedent?”<p>What does the job entail? Obviously designing policies and procedures for Blink Health and our other ventures. In addition to taking the lead on designing our governance, you’ll help implement, evaluate, and improve our policies and procedures. There will be audits, both internal and external. There will be partner evaluations to answer, and partner evaluations to perform. You’ll be figuring out how we can use 3rd party services more securely, and how to segment and protect our data internally. These activities won’t take all your time, though. You’ll have plenty of time to pursue other things that help improve Blink’s overall security, and plenty of discretion as to how to go about that. You’ll have a lot of responsibility, but you’ll also always have help and guidance.<p>Maybe you’re a governance &amp; risk management consultant who prefers to hang out with the pen testers. Maybe you work at BigCo and are frustrated with how long it takes to get things done. Maybe you’re a technical security person who’s discovered that they find the organizational aspects of security <i>really interesting</i>. Maybe you’ve got some other reason that you’re interested. It’s all good, let’s find a way for you to do interesting work and contribute to fixing health care.<p>Why you want to work for Blink Health:<p>* Interesting, varied work<p>* Building a real thing that actually helps people<p>* Get in early on a startup that has hundreds of thousands of paying customers<p>* Healthy work environment (friendly, reasonable people, crunch time is super-rare)<p>* Standard “well-funded startup” perks (unlimited vacation time (you will actually take vacation), free lunches, great stock plan, etc.)<p>* Standard “real company” benefits (health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental, 401(k), etc.)<p>What you should have to apply:<p>* Practical experience related to policy, governance, risk, and&#x2F;or compliance. HIPAA a plus.<p>* Familiarity with and interest in the technical aspects of security<p>* Desire for varied work<p>* Willingness to work in NYC SoHo","time":1491232358,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14028797,"parent":14023198,"time":1491269114,"type":"comment"},{"by":"iconvalleysil","id":14024474,"parent":14023198,"text":"CyMetica | San Francisco | Remote OK | Interns Ok<p>We build datasets for machine learning and AI efforts around the world.
