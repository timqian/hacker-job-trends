At this time we aren&#x27;t prepared to offer H1B&#x2F;Visa sponsorship or remote work.<p>JOB DESCRIPTION Currently, we are working closely with our customers to rapidly prototype, build, and refine the Jellyfish platform. We are using a Django stack (Python 3, Django, Postgres) hosted on AWS, so experience with these technologies is a plus. We are also seeking to augment the team with someone with substantial experience with toolkits like scikit-learn.<p>ABOUT YOU Ideal candidates will have two or more years experience building software and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a computer-science-adjacent field. We will also consider equivalent experience in lieu of a degree. Familiarity with building and bringing software to market is a huge plus. As we are an early-stage startup there is the standard caveat: we&#x27;re working quite hard to quickly bring this to market, so there will be a non-zero amount of unpredictability. The flip side of that is, of course, the opportunity to join an early-stage startup working on an interesting idea.<p>TECH STACK Python (Django, NumPy), PostgreSQL, AWS, Nginx\nCOMPENSATION Competitive salary plus equity grant<p>Email resumes to jobs [at] jelly.ai or you can contact me directly asm [at] jelly.ai with questions.","time":1512175226,"type":"comment"},{"by":"lukasm","id":15831887,"parent":15824597,"text":"RolePoint | Software Engineer | London | Full-Time | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rolepoint.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rolepoint.com&#x2F;</a><p>At Rolepoint we help companies hire and retain talent with our SaaS product.

The requirements are: a good background in mathematics and statistics, and a deep interest in language and linguistics. Programming skill is a huge plus, but not an absolute requirement.<p>I believe we are poised to make a huge dent in the world of NLP and linguistics. The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank).

Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it.

Searching by geography, demographics, AdQuick score and a myriad of other attributes from disparate data sources is computationally expensive. It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times and server costs low.<p>3. We&#x27;re a data science company. We integrate with Google Analytics &amp; AdWords and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior (CTR in a region). ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We&#x27;ll use machine learning to create better campaigns overtime.<p>4. Our backend systems have to deal with a myriad of inventory CSV, PDF formats, requiring robust and fast file validations, normalization and ingestion systems.<p>5.

Founder #2 is interviewing today with one of the big 5 tech companies which means we need another founder who can manage at least one of the following areas: PHP, iOS and Android.  Git experience and Linux skills are important.  We are also interested in a founder who can fully manage a professional Kickstarter&#x2F;Indiegogo&#x2F;Fundly launch.<p>DnsLearning was created to help parents who have young kids whose minds are beginning to be taken over by YouTube&#x27;s deep neural network recommendation system.  In other words, we are trying to restore some balance between how much time a young child spends watching minecraft videos vs the time spent on education sites like DuoLingo and Khan Academy.<p>Our tech works by setting a child&#x27;s computer or tablet to use one of our DNSLearning servers.  After 30 mins, the server will switch the device from &quot;play mode&quot; to &quot;learn mode&quot;.  In learn mode, entertainment sites are blocked.  When the user earns a few points on one of our supported education sites, we will detect this and switch the device back to play mode.  It only takes 3 or 4 mins for a child to earn enough points to get back to play mode.<p>Real marketing will begin once the apps are 100% ready.  Currently we have 130 users that have signed up to use our app manually, using manual DNS config.  Android and Apple apps are very close to being feature complete.<p>A few tech details about us:<p>There are always interesting PHP, C++, MySQL, iOS and Android problems to solve.  For example, how do you uniquely identify different users coming from the same IP address in Android, iOS, or using a manual DNS setup?  For manual DNS, our answer is to use a separate server for multiple users in the same house.  If a customer has IPv6, we are able to assign a unique IP address to every customer.  It is easy to assign hundreds of IP addresses to a single server.  One of the problems we had to solve with IPv6 has to do with knowing, in our C++, what address the incoming UDP packet used to access the server.  When we were working on this problem, the Linux kernel did not save this information.  Last time I checked, Go still does not support this. Ngnix added similar support only a few months before we did.<p>We are looking for a hard working, passionate co-founder WHO BELIEVES LIKE WE DO, that parents deserve technology that is able to guide young minds away from junk grade online entertainment toward, at least for a few minutes, education sites that will help young minds to develop confidence and skills to hopefully provide a stronger knowledge foundation that is critical for their future.<p>support@dnslearning.org","time":1512154741,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":15826104,"parent":15824597,"time":1512153754,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":15826024,"parent":15824597,"time":1512153155,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pjbull","id":15825819,"parent":15824597,"text":"DrivenData Labs | Software engineer (Python) w&#x2F; focus on data applications | Berkeley, CA | ONSITE | FULLTIME<p>DrivenData brings the transformative power of data science to organizations tackling the world’s biggest challenges.
