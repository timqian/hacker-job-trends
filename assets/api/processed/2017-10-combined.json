The field of NLP parsing has been moving slowly for the last 20 years because of its utter dependence on labelled training data such as the Penn Treebank. In my research I&#x27;ve discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.

Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.

Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as ‘adventures’. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.<p>We are backed by one of the UK’s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First. We care about our craft and it’s important to us that you do as well. We’re looking for someone with a couple of years of coding experience under their belt and who’s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that you’re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it.<p>You’ll work on a customer facing React.js website as well as an Android only React Native app. You don’t have to know our whole tech stack but it’s important that you’re willing to learn. You’ll collaborate closely with the CTO as we turn our proof of concept into an MVP ready for production. You’ll build new features, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you.<p>We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually puts you in an unstable spot. Our projects are written in Javascript, React.js, React Native and all use ES6. For this role, Javascript skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education. We don’t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what you’re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.<p>We see coding as a way of communication, it’s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English. Our intention is to enable remote working and flexible working hours as soon as we can.

Accelerated.<p><i>Who we’re looking for:</i><p>Haskellers with an interest in distributed systems and machine learning. The more production Haskell experience, the better. Applied maths and type theory backgrounds are highly desirable, as is experience with optimizing large in-memory data structures. Our culture is built on a foundation of good communication skills and solid engineering principles. Sentenai has been built with Haskell and running on FreeBSD since day 1, and two years later Sentenai remains committed to Haskell as we grow our engineering team.<p><i>Why?</i><p>Machine intelligence represents a huge potential breakthrough in many industries, from manufacturing to aircraft maintenance. The problem is that working with sensor data to build predictive applications is a slow, time consuming process fraught with data engineering challenges. At Sentenai, we’re determined to change that.<p>Sentenai is the first cloud data infrastructure purpose-built for data scientists and machine learning engineers who need to rapidly mine diverse sensor data sets for behavioral patterns and build targeted training sets for predictive models.<p>At the core of Sentenai is a novel set of distributed machine learning technologies and a distributed time-series query engine that natively understands sensor fusion and cross-stream pattern mining. Applied to our distributed data storage and indexing system, these technologies help Sentenai abstract away the details or data preparation, storage and querying on time series data to provide users with a clean data interface to their data without exposing them to the complexities of the underlying database technologies we develop.<p><i>Company details:</i><p>Sentenai is based in Cambridge, MA in Central Square. Our founding team has deep experience in the IoT space and our engineering team consists of Haskell engineers with a wide range of experience levels (from two to ten years) and non-computer interests (like travel, euro games, playing music, cooking, and hunting for fine wine). We love open source and conferences&#x2F;meetups, so you’ll probably see some of us attending various conferences or organizing meetups around our interests. Our investors include funds like Flybridge, Founder Collective, Hyperplane and Project 11.<p>Sound interesting?

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. \nThat’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.
