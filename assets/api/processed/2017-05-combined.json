It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

You’ll officially own automation for the Systems team, creating new tools and taking over the maintenance of existing tools that others across the organization will use every day.

This value is reflected in our hiring ethos: we believe that the strongest teams have diverse backgrounds. Our approach to hiring has been validated by academic and industry studies that show that workforce diversity improves team and business performance.

We are a global liquidity provider and market maker, operating around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.<p>It’s no secret that we’re big believers in functional programming; OCaml, a statically typed functional language, is our primary development platform. Jane Street’s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it’s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We’re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code?

The global supply chain is one the world&#x27;s largest economic engines.<p>The manufacturers, distributors, brands, and retailers that make up this complex network struggle to track and respond to supply and demand as their products travel from production to consumer. Those who try rely on 40-year-old data standards, lots of manual Excel work, and hordes of human middleware.<p>Alloy is an end-to-end supply chain visibility platform that provides the first comprehensive, low-latency view of demand and inventory across all distribution channels. Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing businesses to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand. We tie all of this information together with smart notifications that help get products to the right place at the right time.<p>We are post-revenue, well funded by leading VCs, and growing rapidly, with large contracts from some of the world&#x27;s most recognisable brands. Our small team has diverse backgrounds and experience in analytics, large-scale enterprise SaaS, and retail and financial technology. Culture really matters to us: we value diversity in all forms and strive to foster integrity, respect, and open communication.<p>We use Google Cloud Platform, Postgres, Redis, Python, modern Java, and React, all wrapped in beautiful design.<p>== About You ==<p>You thrive in a small team where you can build technology from the ground up.

The company’s field-ready hardware has been designed from the ground up including the ultrasound transducers (designed and built on-site), the mechanical housing (a 15,000-psi pressure vessel) and the electronics (a custom FPGA and arm SoC Architecture running an embedded Linux).  Our image processing pipeline processes up to 20 Gbits of data every second to create datasets that can be used to find small cracks in wells that can be many kilometers long.  Our team consists of experts from machine vision, medical imaging, aerospace, and computer graphics sectors.  With several of North America’s largest oil and gas companies already secured as early customers, DarkVision’s flagship product is now making its debut in the field.  We’re not a typical oil and gas service company. We’re not your typical &#x27;app 2.0&#x27; or LOB company. And we&#x27;re not a 20-year science experiment that never delivers a product of value.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

We’re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.\nBACK-END POSITION\nThis isn’t a run-of-the-mill MVC app and requires solving performance and scalability problems in distributed systems using data combined from many sources, several of which are real-time sources including GPS data. Because of this complexity, we&#x27;re limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow or those who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don&#x27;t apply unless you can demonstrate one, if not both, of these.\nBack-end stack: Our product is built on Scala, Postgresql, Event Sourcing using Apache Beam atop Google Data Flow, Akka, and the Scala Play framework. Our front-end is predominantly AngularJS.","time":1493835539,"type":"comment"},{"by":"prasannaxr","id":14253932,"parent":14238005,"text":"f testing","time":1493799695,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14239071,"parent":14238005,"time":1493656732,"type":"comment"},{"by":"brdd","id":14241132,"parent":14238005,"text":"Conduit | Software engineer (Full stack, front-end, back-end) | Boston&#x2F;Cambridge | FULL-TIME | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cond.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cond.co</a><p>====<p>Conduit is a small venture-backed startup based out of Cambridge.
