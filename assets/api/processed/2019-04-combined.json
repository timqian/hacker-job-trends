We&#x27;re Australia&#x27;s largest open, electric vehicle (EV) network for modern EV&#x27;s. As part of that, Chargefox raised $17 million to build a network of ultra-rapid chargers to connect major cities across the country, but that&#x27;s only a fraction of what we do. We have an unwavering focus on simplifying the EV charging experience for everyone - be they drivers, fleet managers, charge station owners, car manufacturers, energy retailers or more.<p>Our customers can find, use and pay for electric vehicle charging using their mobile. We’re continually adding new stations to the Chargefox network. So far we&#x27;ve processed over 20,000 charging sessions on more than 500 plugs across Australia and New Zealand, dispensing a total of over 165MWh of electricity. That&#x27;s enough electricity to power the average household for two decades, and we&#x27;re still growing fast. We&#x27;re excited!<p>Our apps are built in React Native, and we&#x27;re looking for someone to join the team to help. Values really matter (really!), so we’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for these - (Customer Focus, Sustainability, Safety, Transparency, Integrity and Collaboration).<p>WHO WE&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with a deep expertise in React Native (experts in React or Android&#x2F;iOS will be considered as well) who will be able to provide both technical leadership for the team and to also deliver features.

We want to see empathy for the driver and their experience along the way too.\nWe expect you to know how to build scalable and well architected software solutions. We&#x27;re looking for engineers, rather than coders. At Chargefox, we are big believers in a pragmatic and agile approach to software development. You will be participating in team rituals including stand-ups, retrospectives, occasional pair-programming and on-call support.

We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page!

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.

It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.<p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.<p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.<p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.<p>Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.<p>We are hiring for a Scala Backend Engineering role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.<p>- Scala Backend Engineer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;join&#x2F;backend.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;join&#x2F;backend.html</a><p>- Frontend Engineer\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;join&#x2F;frontend.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;join&#x2F;frontend.html</a><p>Some more useful links:<p>- Find out more about Company Culture: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;culture.html</a>.","time":1554144113,"type":"comment"},{"by":"brookegroesbeck","id":19546129,"parent":19543940,"text":"Auth0 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;</a>) | Seattle - Buenos Aires - London - Sydney - Tokyo - Remote | Full-time | Engineering\nAuth0 is a Series D&#x2F;435 employee company with major growth plans for 2019.

OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.<p>Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too!

Many databases to store our 200TB+ of production data including MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, DynamoDB &amp; RDS.<p>We have some monolithic applications though new products &amp; platforms are built using microservices running Docker containers on AWS ECS with some footprint in Azure.

We also use Terraform for configuring infrastructure, Jenkins for CI, and Git&#x2F;GitLab for source code. These are flexible (they can and will change) and what a candidate knows for stack is not as important as their ability to think creatively – we can train languages, it’s much harder to train curiosity and intellectual drive.<p>Apply or reach out directly to Marc Spiron (Lead Talent Acquisition Partner) at mspiron@billtrust.com.","time":1554136896,"type":"comment"},{"by":"nfriedly","id":19545212,"parent":19543940,"text":"Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tanium.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?gh_src=qprker8f1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tanium.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?gh_src=qprker8f1</a><p>Tanium&#x27;s product is basically computer security &amp; management software for government and large enterprises.
