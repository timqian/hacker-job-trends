No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab).

Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.<p>We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.

We’re pragmatic, but we don’t let that interfere with our perfectionism. We’re fluent in computing concepts from anonymous memory management to monadic zeros.<p>We’re building a platform. Engineering innovation is our competitive advantage. We’re doing something new and different in an industry that hasn’t seen any real innovation in the last century. That excites us.<p>We try to be technology agnostic, preferring suitability to ideology. Our services are small and chatty, communicating through well-defined interfaces. Sometimes we compose them in ways that are surprising even to us. We think that’s healthy for a platform company. In general, we believe that sound system architecture and design are more important than any particular technology.<p>Day to day we use Node.js, Cassandra, Jenkins, Go, Java, Puppet, and GitHub. We like continuous integration. In fact, we like most forms of process automation. Sometimes our tools make us happy, sometimes they make us sad. When they make us sad, we make them better.<p>We like to work. We love to play. We don’t consider these activities mutually exclusive.<p>There aren’t many of us. We’re looking for more.<p>About You<p>You’re an engineering powerhouse who wants to work on challenging problems with a group of equally amazing colleagues. Your depth of knowledge in many areas of computing should qualify you as a specialist, but your breadth of expertise demands that you describe yourself as a generalist. Sometimes you think the two aren’t so different, but you resist that sort of reductionism.<p>You’re well rounded. You have hobbies that don’t involve computers. Despite your expertise, you sometimes surprise casual acquaintances with your profession. You can’t carry a tune but you sing anyways. Your recreational reading includes works by  Kurt Vonnegut, W. Richard Stevens, and Dr. Seuss.<p>You’re not sure whether P equals NP, but the possibility leaves you feeling both titillated and terrified. Sometimes, while considering the repercussions, you lose composure.<p>Mutable state is your frenemy. You appreciate what Scala has managed to do on the JVM. You’ve developed several profiles of the language, each Turing complete. You’re curious about the future of Go. You’ve toyed with several syntactic variants of your own competing language based on the π-calculus. You’re an expert at SQL, but would never describe yourself that way.<p>You had a check for $2.56 from Donald Knuth. You cashed it when your bank started displaying digitized check scans in your transaction history because you hate physical media.<p>You can explain technical concepts to non-technical people. Non-technical people enjoy the experience. At parties your conversations transition seamlessly from Emacs vs. vi to Beatles vs. Stones.<p>You consider coding a craft – as much art as science. It’s your creative outlet. You consider quines a form of poetry. You often describe code as beautiful.<p>You’re self aware. Some of these statements don’t apply to you, but you can read between the lines. Others upset you. You understand why at a fundamental level. You can argue your position, and you can win.<p>Sound like you?
