However, we come in by creating friendly competition between local retailers, with the convenience of online shopping and the engagement of social sharing, including education of the consumer along the way.<p>We&#x27;ve already started generating interest with the launch of our early-access landing page: \n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mydiamondrevolution.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mydiamondrevolution.com</a><p>---<p>SKILLS<p>HTML, CSS, MySQL, Node.js, Web Applications, Angular.JS, Amazon Web Services (AWS)<p>COMPENSATION<p>15.0% – 20.0% Equity<p>Email: matt@mydiamondrevolution.com","time":1443749782,"type":"comment"},{"by":"spackham","id":10317359,"parent":10311580,"text":"Codio (UK - REMOTE) are looking for technical authors &amp; developers to create education content for schools, colleges and universities and self-learners.<p>Codio is a web based IDE + authoring&#x2F;publishing platform focused on teaching people to code from the age of 8 right up to adults.<p>If you are interested please submit an application to this job listing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;99122&#x2F;lead-technical-author-developer-codio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;99122&#x2F;lead-technical-...</a>","time":1443775012,"type":"comment"},{"by":"MrGando","id":10313666,"parent":10311580,"text":"Vungle | San Francisco, CA Full-Time | ONSITE | VISA (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vungle.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vungle.com&#x2F;careers</a>)<p>Goal: Help us make mobile video ads not suck!<p>About Us:<p>- Leader in the Space : <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1U9FdpR\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1U9FdpR</a><p>- Profitable<p>- Benefits include covering expense for Gym, Food, Travel, Relocation, and paid to work from any of our 5 international offices for 2 weeks!<p>Looking For:<p>* iOS Engineer (Senior &amp; Non-Senior)<p>- Join the iOS SDK team!

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house). Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure! E-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject &quot;Software engineer&quot;) or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill). Please include in either the e-mail or the DM at least one commit (repo+SHA) from one of our open source projects that stirs you at some level:  something you found interesting, or inspiring, or unspeakably vile -- or perhaps even all three!

Core hours for most of us are in London time, but we now have developers also in EST and CST (partly overlapping). We&#x27;re slowly hiring mid-level and senior full stack developers (one every couple of months), but our next hire or two will be focused on app dev!  We have patient and clinician apps that need to be re-worked and greatly expanded (to navigate a diverse medical record), and we&#x27;ve been working for a while now on a maternity app that takes the midwives and mother all the way through a pregnancy.  That app is based on AppGyver Steroids (which in turn is built around Cordova), so you should be able to jump into that fairly easily.  We&#x27;re thus working with JavaScript, WebSQL, jQuery, backbone, HTML&#x2F;CSS.  Extra points if you&#x27;ve dealt with large&#x2F;complex apps and managing data offline (and the complexity that comes with synching periodically with the server, where new data may come from either the app or the server);<p>For the server side -- apps authenticate with OAuth2, speaking JSON to a REST API; our server-side back end and webapp are primarily Java-based, gradually being refactoring towards a microservice structure.  So if you&#x27;re interested in helping out as well implementing new REST calls as needed, Java experience will ease that path.<p>More about PKB<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.<p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.<p>We&#x27;re building something that actively, directly, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable. If you&#x27;re interested in PKB&#x27;s growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I&#x27;m in the CTO role.<p>We&#x27;re pragmatic about work&#x2F;life balance. I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live. Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I get my kids up in the morning, and I&#x27;m with them entirely late-afternoon &amp; evening (while my wife works), then I fill in some extra hours around the edges as needed. We&#x27;re collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what&#x27;s effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall. One of our developers only codes part time (and occasionally takes long leaves of absence), because he&#x27;s also a theatre director.<p>Culture -- we live in various parts of the UK, central France, Bangalore, Vienna, Budapest, NYC and Costa Rica; we range in age (though I don&#x27;t actually know everyone&#x27;s ages, so I can&#x27;t say exactly!). We&#x27;re not all native English speakers -- but communication skills trump even technical skills for remote teams, so we all understand, speak and write English easily and with the confidence to interrupt if we didn&#x27;t catch something. We collaborate, not compete -- let ideas fight it out, but we&#x27;re on the same team. We like to laugh (but jokes stay tasteful), we share stories of what we did over the weekend (but these don&#x27;t normally end &quot;then I passed out&quot;).<p>If we sound like a good match, get in touch: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html</a> (I&#x27;m also contactable directly -- see profile -- but I get a lot of email).

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. I am posting this from a cafe in Siem Reap right nowwww.<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).

Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 14 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas&#x2F;Numpy&#x2F;etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers.

Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible<p>We need someone to help our Data Science team operations. You&#x27;ll help us maintain and activate various data-driven ad targeting. For example, a client may provide us a billion records which we need to analyze and transform into an audience segment. This isn&#x27;t a software engineering position, but you&#x27;ll want to be (or learn to be) pretty capable at the command line, and able to work with Python&#x2F;Bash or other scripting languages. More than anything, we want someone who can maintain order among various client-facing tasks. On paper, we have a neat structured process; in reality, we need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward. If you like combing through data in Excel, R or similar, this might be a great fit. If you&#x27;ve wanted the opportunity to get your hands on large amounts of data from an analysis or management perspective, please reach out to us.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1443716211,"type":"comment"},{"by":"caitlinspothero","id":10311877,"parent":10311580,"text":"SpotHero | Chicago, IL | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spothero.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spothero.com</a>\nSpotHero is changing parking, and our tools will redefine the transportation industry.

We have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years.

We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized<p>* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery<p>* Tons of our code is open source.
