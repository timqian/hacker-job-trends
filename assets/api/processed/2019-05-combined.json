After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren&#x27;t able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn&#x27;t had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?<p>Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there&#x27;s enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.<p>We&#x27;re at this exciting inflection point – we&#x27;ve shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership.

The Academia.edu platform addresses two problems:<p>- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic paper ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 20 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 60 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company has a freemium business model.

All new web code is written in TypeScript and old code is being progressively converted. We use F# in production and the financial services are written in it, and run on AWS.<p>– Strong awareness of the interplay between JavaScript and HTML &amp; CSS, and familiarity with Single-Page Applications.

However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp;amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.","time":1556741418,"type":"comment"},{"by":"59243","id":19799317,"parent":19797594,"text":"Expensify | Full-Stack, PHP, Java, C++, iOS, Android, and&#x2F;or Infrastructure Engineer | San Francisco, Portland, Michigan, London | REMOTE, VISA welcome | Full-time | we.are.expensify.com | $135K+<p>Expensify is the most widely used expense management system in the world, with millions of users and more customers than the rest of the industry combined, processing billions of real dollars annually.

Many databases to store our 200TB+ of production data including MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, DynamoDB &amp; RDS.<p>We have some monolithic applications though new products &amp; platforms are built using microservices running Docker containers on AWS ECS with some footprint in Azure. We leverage many AWS services – Lambda, CloudWatch, S3, EC2, Route53, IAM, SQS, SNS and more. We also use Terraform for configuring infrastructure, Jenkins for CI, and Git&#x2F;GitLab for source code. These are flexible (they can and will change) and what a candidate knows for stack is not as important as their ability to think creatively – we can train languages, it’s much harder to train curiosity and intellectual drive.<p>Apply or reach out directly to Marc Spiron (Lead Talent Acquisition Partner) at mspiron@billtrust.com.","time":1556828084,"type":"comment"},{"by":"LookerSecurity","id":19809941,"parent":19797594,"text":"Looker | Various | Security | Onsite&#x2F;Remote<p>Looker has LOTS of open positions on the security team.

Fortune called us the &quot;Usain Bolt of cyber­security&quot; [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].<p>The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is &quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot; [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as &quot;high risk&quot;. [4]<p>Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].<p>Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed&#x2F;unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.<p>Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.<p>We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.<p>We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.<p>Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].<p>--<p>Senior Software Engineer - Tanium&#x27;s Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I&#x27;ve never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.<p>Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.<p>No one says &quot;not my job&quot;, and depending on what you&#x27;re doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year.

It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.<p>Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application.

We manage an ever growing army of microservices with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.<p>As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing&#x2F;reviewing&#x2F;writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.
