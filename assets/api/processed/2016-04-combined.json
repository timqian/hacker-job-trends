It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 50,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.

We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Moving between divisions, temporarily or permanently, is possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica LA, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Sydney, Berlin, Singapore and Beijing, with more coming.<p>We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop.

We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ skill: your colleagues would say you get things done to a high standard. You know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.<p>Speaking of process, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: React, iOS, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and Kaizen weeks for self-improvement and experimentation.
